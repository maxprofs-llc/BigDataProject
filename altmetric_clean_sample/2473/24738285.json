TFD protection in biological fluids and their delivery to the site of infection require formulation in appropriate delivery systems. In this work, we build on a classical phosphatidylcholine\/phosphatidylethanolamine (POPC\/DOPE) scaffold to design TFD-loaded cationic liposomes by combining the DNA-complexing abilities of a bolaamphiphile, (1,1'-(dodecane-1,12-diyl)-bis-(9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridinium) chloride (12-bis-THA), with the biocompatible cationic lipid ethyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPePC). The goal is to perform a structural study to determine the impact of the bolaamphiphile and TFD incorporation on the liposome structure, the capacity for TFD encapsulation, and the colloidal stability in saline media and cell culture environments.\nThe systems are characterized by means of dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and \u03b6-potential measurements, to provide a clear picture of the liposome structure. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is used to assess the compaction of the oligonucleotide in a psi form, while steady-state fluorescence and fluorescence correlation spectroscopies give insight into the entrapment rate and distribution of the TFD in the liposomes.\nWe found that the combination of the two cationic species, 12-bis-THA and DPePC, allows encapsulation of 90% of the TFD. Results of CD experiments revealed that the TFD is condensed, therefore likely protected from the lytic action of serum nucleases. Finally, the systems showed colloidal stability in aqueous dispersion with ionic strength comparable to biologically relevant media.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d15","authors":["Marianna Mamusa","Francesco Barbero","Costanza Montis","Laura Cutillo","Ana Gonzalez-Paredes","Debora Berti"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcis.2017.08.080","first_seen_on":"2017-09-04T03:26:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00219797","1095-7103"],"journal":"Journal of Colloid & Interface Science","last_mentioned_on":1504495383,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28865342?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28865342","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Inclusion of oligonucleotide antimicrobials in biocompatible cationic liposomes: a structural study","type":"article","volume":"508","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inclusion-oligonucleotide-antimicrobials-biocompatible-cationic-liposomes-structural-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":7227031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116503,"mean":12.024244030146,"rank":94500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116503,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":884,"mean":2.0414043035108,"rank":665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":884,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.1730769230769,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dnananopapers\/statuses\/904545315667165184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24738285],"posted_on":"2017-09-04T03:23:03+00:00","author":{"name":"DNA nanotech papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/684361270678700032\/lhzs0Jgh_normal.png","description":"Bot posts academic papers on nucleic acid nanotechnology eg RNA, DNA nanostructures, self assembly, and protein-DNA interaction.
