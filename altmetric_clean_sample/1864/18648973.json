Lawsone was detected (0.002-88.2%) in 21 of the 25 temporary black henna tattoo samples analysed. Heavy metal contaminant levels were 0.44-3.11\u2009ppm for Co, 1.13-2.20\u2009ppm for Ni, 1.59-17.7\u2009ppm for Pb, and 35.0-76.9\u2009ppm for Cr.\nOur results suggest that commercial temporary black henna mixtures containing PPD levels up to 51.6% pose a risk of contact sensitization and severe allergic contact dermatitis among users. It is important to identify both the additives and metallic contaminants of black henna tattoo products; the significance of metal contaminants has still to be assessed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000260f","authors":["Ayca Aktas Sukuroglu","Dilek Battal","Sema Burgaz"],"doi":"10.1111\/cod.12702","first_seen_on":"2017-04-09T01:40:16+00:00","issns":["01051873"],"journal":"Contact Dermatitis (01051873)","last_mentioned_on":1491353403,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27757963\/"],"pmid":"27757963","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Monitoring of Lawsone, p -phenylenediamine and heavy metals in commercial temporary black henna tattoos sold in Turkey","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monitoring-lawsone-pphenylenediamine-heavy-metals-commercial-temporary-black-henna-tattoos-sold-turk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":6420439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1150524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251870,"mean":13.047497008365,"rank":179802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251870,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1366,"mean":3.1615941391941,"rank":1166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1366,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.175,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Titanium, a major constituent of blue ink, causes resistance to Nd-YAG (1064 nm) laser: results of animal experiments. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1441679355952094&id=960614157391952","license":"public","citation_ids":[18648969,18648970,18648971,2897210,18648973,16270449,18648974,18648975,18648977,18648978,18648979,18648980,18648981,3449713,18648983,18648985,3453331,18648986,18648969],"posted_on":"2017-04-05T00:50:03+00:00","summary":"Studies on some of the dangers of tattoos. \nThis list is not comprehensive.
