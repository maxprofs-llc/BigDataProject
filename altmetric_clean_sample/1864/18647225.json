MPP"],"citation":{"abstract":"Evolutionary divergence of potato mop-top virus (PMTV), a tri-partite single-stranded RNA virus, is exceptionally low, based on the analysis of sequences obtained from isolates from Europe, Asia, and North America. In general, RNA viruses exist as dynamic populations of closely related and recombinant genomes that are subjected to continuous genetic variation. The reason behind the low genetic variation of PMTV remains unclear. The question remains whether low variability is a shared property of all PMTV isolates or is a result of the limited number of isolates characterized so far. We hypothesized that higher divergence of the virus might exist in the Andean regions of South America, the center of potato domestication. Here we report high variability of PMTV isolates collected from twelve fields in three locations in the Andean region of Peru. To evaluate PMTV genetic variation in Peru, we generated full-length cDNA clones, which allowed reliable comparative molecular and pathobiological characterization of individual isolates. We found significant divergence of the CP-RT and the 8K sequences. The 8K cistron, which encodes a viral suppressor of RNA silencing, was found to be under diversifying selection. Phylogenetic analysis determined that, based on the CP-RT sequence, all PMTV isolates could be categorized into three separate lineages (clades). Moreover, we found evidence for recombination between two clades. Using infectious cDNA clones of the representatives of these two clades, as well as reassortants for RNA-CP genomic component, we determined pathobiological differences between the lineages, which we coined as S (for severe) and M (for mild) types. Interestingly, all isolates characterized previously (from Europe, Asia and North America) fall into S-type clade, whereas most of the Peruvian isolates belong to the M-type. Taken together, our results support the notion about single introduction of PMTV from the center of potato origin to Europe and subsequent spread of the S-type into Asia and USA. This inclining is also supported by suggested novel classification of isolates based on genetic constellations. This article is protected by copyright.
