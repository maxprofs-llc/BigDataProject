The agreement between SpotOn and the conventional methods was assessed using the Bland-Altman random-effects approach for repeated measures. The mean difference between SpotOn and the esophageal temperature during vascular surgery was+0.08\u00b0C (95% limit of agreement -0.25 to+0.40\u00b0C). During cardiac surgery, during off CPB, the mean difference between SpotOn and the pulmonary arterial temperature was -0.05\u00b0C (95% limits of agreement -0.56 to+0.47\u00b0C). Throughout cardiac surgery (on and off CPB), the mean difference between SpotOn and the nasopharyngeal temperature was -0.12\u00b0C (95% limits of agreement -0.94 to+0.71\u00b0C). Poor agreement between the SpotOn and nasopharyngeal temperatures was detected in hypothermia below approximately 32\u00b0C.\nAccording to this preliminary study, the deep body temperature measured using the zero-heat-flux system was in good agreement with standard core temperatures during lower extremity vascular and cardiac surgery. However, agreement was questionable during hypothermia below 32\u00b0C.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb4","authors":["Marja-Tellervo M\u00e4kinen","Anne Pesonen","Irma Jousela","Janne P\u00e4iv\u00e4rinta","Satu Poikaj\u00e4rvi","Anders Alb\u00e4ck","Ulla-Stina Salminen","Eero Pesonen"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.jvca.2016.03.141","first_seen_on":"2017-04-08T19:52:55+00:00","issns":["10530770"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1488326400,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27521967"],"pmid":"27521967","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Novel Zero-Heat-Flux Deep Body Temperature Measurement in Lower Extremity Vascular and Cardiac Surgery","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-zeroheatflux-deep-body-temperature-measurement-lower-extremity-vascular-cardiac-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":2115802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5040329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247504,"mean":12.946483428483,"rank":84641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":160142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247504,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1181,"mean":0.87326949152542,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1181,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":0.98936170212766,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
