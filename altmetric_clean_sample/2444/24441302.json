The measurements by Venera 4 of the equatorial surface temperature indicate that the microwave readings were high, so that the polar ice caps may be allowed to exist in the face of the 10-centimeter readings of polar temperature. Life seems to be distinctly possible at the edges of the ice sheets.","ads_id":"1968Sci...159.1097L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["W. F.
