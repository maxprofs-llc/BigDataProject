Although long-term data is required to compare its efficacy with surgically replaced valves, percutaneous procedures can serve as a delay to surgical valve replacement which over a patients' lifetime with congenital heart disease, can minimise the amount of invasive surgeries and potential complications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Abhinay Challa","Ryan Markham","Darren Walters"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2017-221104","first_seen_on":"2017-08-28T23:08:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1503961697,"links":["http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2017\/bcr-2017-221104.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2017\/bcr-2017-221104.full.pdf","pmid":"28768675","pubdate":"2017-08-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","startpage":"bcr-2017-221104","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Percutaneous valve in valve in the tricuspid position in a patient with Tetralogy of Fallot","type":"article","volume":"2017"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":6404290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1147328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171049,"mean":12.506704176605,"rank":121057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171049,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3313,"mean":5.4358725845411,"rank":1922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3313,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":11.693210884354,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tpchlibrary\/statuses\/902306872459354113","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24448354],"posted_on":"2017-08-28T23:08:17+00:00","author":{"name":"TPCH Library","url":"http:\/\/www.health.qld.gov.au\/tpch","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000847983892\/01ebf606e340905a585fa0cda4397cfa_normal.jpeg","description":"The Prince Charles Hospital Library","id_on_source":"tpchlibrary","tweeter_id":"55118981","geo":{"lt":-27.46794,"ln":153.02809,"country":"AU"},"followers":144},"tweet_id":"902306872459354113"}]}}
