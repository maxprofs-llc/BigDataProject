Other interesting non-chemo conditioning recently too","Conditioning for HSCT Using a Hematopoietic-Cell-Specific Internalizing Immunotoxin","Non-genotoxic conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using a hematopoietic-cell-specific interna\u2026"],"citation":{"abstract":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers curative therapy for patients with hemoglobinopathies, congenital immunodeficiencies, and other conditions, possibly including AIDS. Autologous HSCT using genetically corrected cells would avoid the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but the genotoxicity of conditioning remains a substantial barrier to the development of this approach. Here we report an internalizing immunotoxin targeting the hematopoietic-cell-restricted CD45 receptor that effectively conditions immunocompetent mice. A single dose of the immunotoxin, CD45-saporin (SAP), enabled efficient (>90%) engraftment of donor cells and full correction of a sickle-cell anemia model. In contrast to irradiation, CD45-SAP completely avoided neutropenia and anemia, spared bone marrow and thymic niches, enabling rapid recovery of T and B cells, preserved anti-fungal immunity, and had minimal overall toxicity. This non-genotoxic conditioning method may provide an attractive alternative to current conditioning regimens for HSCT in the treatment of non-malignant blood diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003162","authors":["Rahul Palchaudhuri","Borja Saez","Jonathan Hoggatt","Amir Schajnovitz","David B Sykes","Tiffany A Tate","Agnieszka Czechowicz","Youmna Kfoury","FNU Ruchika","Derrick J Rossi","Gregory L Verdine","Michael K Mansour","David T Scadden","Palchaudhuri R","Saez B","Hoggatt J","Schajnovitz A","Sykes DB","Tate TA","Czechowicz A","Kfoury Y","Ruchika F","Rossi DJ","Verdine GL","Mansour MK","Scadden DT","Palchaudhuri, Rahul","Saez, Borja","Hoggatt, Jonathan","Schajnovitz, Amir","Sykes, David B","Tate, Tiffany A","Czechowicz, Agnieszka","Kfoury, Youmna","Ruchika, Fnu","Rossi, Derrick J","Verdine, Gregory L","Mansour, Michael K","Scadden, David T"],"doi":"10.1038\/nbt.3584","endpage":"745","first_seen_on":"2016-06-06T18:01:55+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nhlbi"],"issns":["1087-0156","1546-1696"],"issue":"7","journal":"Nature Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1484697600,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nbt\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nbt.3584.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nbt.3584","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nbt\/journal\/v34\/n7\/full\/nbt.3584.html","http:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/726406351?key=3hCgU1VY3M2hZ5y","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nbt\/journal\/v34\/n7\/abs\/nbt.3584.html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27272386"],"pmid":"27272386","pubdate":"2016-06-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Haematopoietic stem cells","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Regenerative medicine","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"738","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Non-genotoxic conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using a hematopoietic-cell-specific internalizing immunotoxin","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nongenotoxic-conditioning-hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation-using-hematopoieticcellspecific-in"},"altmetric_score":{"score":141.62,"score_history":{"1y":37.342,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":141.62},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078137,"mean":6.8589454589436,"rank":51211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8026930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078137,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270789,"mean":11.485715312347,"rank":3962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":266827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270789,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3957,"mean":24.430877148635,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":3834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3957,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":41.221095238095,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":10,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
