Overall, there was no statistically significant difference between TAVI and SAVR in early (odds ratio [OR], 1.01 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.26]) or midterm (OR, 0.96 [CI, 0.81 to 1.14]) all-cause mortality. Analyses restricted to trials (early: OR, 0.80 [CI, 0.51 to 1.25]; midterm: OR, 0.90 [CI, 0.64 to 1.26]) were inconclusive, with wide CIs, whereas analyses of matched studies were similar to the overall results. Transfemoral TAVI provided mortality benefits over SAVR in trials. Analyses restricted to studies of patients at low to intermediate risk showed statistically nonsignificant reductions in early (OR, 0.67 [CI, 0.42 to 1.07]) and midterm (OR, 0.91 [CI, 0.67 to 1.23]) mortality with TAVI. Incidence of periprocedural myocardial infarction, major bleeding, acute kidney injury, and new-onset atrial fibrillation was lower with TAVI, but risk for pacemaker implantation, vascular complications, and paravalvular leak increased. Overall, there was a statistically nonsignificant increased risk in long-term (2- to 5-year) all-cause mortality with TAVI (OR, 1.28 [CI, 0.97 to 1.69]), whereas long-term mortality outcomes in patients at low to intermediate risk were inconclusive, with wide CIs (OR, 1.06 [CI, 0.59 to 1.91]).\nThe number of trials was limited, and study designs and patient characteristics were heterogeneous.\nCompared with SAVR, TAVI may have similar or better early and midterm outcomes for adults with aortic stenosis, including those at low to intermediate risk.\nNone.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000227a","authors":["Giuseppe Gargiulo","Anna Sannino","Davide Capodanno","Marco Barbanti","Sergio Buccheri","Cinzia Perrino","Piera Capranzano","Ciro Indolfi","Bruno Trimarco","Corrado Tamburino","Giovanni Esposito","Gargiulo, Giuseppe","Sannino, Anna","Capodanno, Davide","Barbanti, Marco","Buccheri, Sergio","Perrino, Cinzia","Capranzano, Piera","Indolfi, Ciro","Trimarco, Bruno","Tamburino, Corrado","Esposito, Giovanni"],"doi":"10.7326\/m16-0060","first_seen_on":"2016-06-06T21:12:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0003-4819","1539-3704"],"issue":"5","journal":"Annals of Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1494150092,"links":["http:\/\/www.annals.org\/article.aspx?doi=10.7326\/M16-0060","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7326\/M16-0060","http:\/\/annals.org\/article.aspx?articleID=2526946","http:\/\/annals.org\/article.aspx?articleid=2526946","http:\/\/annals.org\/article.aspx?articleid=2526946&utm_content=buffer7752b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/annals.org\/article.aspx?articleid=2526946&utm_content=bufferd250e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/annals.org\/article.aspx?articleid=2526946&utm_content=buffer65eca&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/annals.org\/article.aspx?articleid=2526946&utm_content=buffer01dcd&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer#.V2bTG7sDsbY.buffer","http:\/\/annals.org\/article.aspx?articleid=2526946&utm_content=buffer7752b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer#.V9YPZOsW6Ks.twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27272666\/","http:\/\/annals.org\/article.aspx?articleid=2526946&utm_content=buffer4a715&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27272666?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27272666?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27272666?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/annals.org\/data\/Journals\/AIM\/0\/AIME201609060-M160060.pdf","pmid":"27272666","pubdate":"2016-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American College of Physicians","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"334","subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","type":"article","volume":"165","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-versus-surgical-aortic-valve-replacement-systematic-review-m-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":61.45,"score_history":{"1y":9.35,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":61.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":144172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8026154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271501,"mean":11.528107086556,"rank":9578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":261922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271501,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7941,"mean":26.713617884131,"rank":702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7941,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":74.208558139535,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":14,"researcher":2,"practitioner":10,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":14,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":11,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
