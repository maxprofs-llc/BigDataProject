Protein solutions with both salts exhibit a reentrant condensation phase behavior. The condensed regime (regime II) in between two salt concentration boundaries (c* < cs < c**) is significantly broadened by replacing H2O with D2O. Within regime II, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) occurs. The samples that undergo LLPS have a lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The value of LCST decreases significantly with increasing solvent fraction of D2O. The effective protein-protein interactions characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering demonstrate that although changing the solvent has negligible effects below c*, where the interactions are dominated by electrostatic repulsion, an enhanced effective attraction is observed in D2O above c*, consistent with the phase behavior observed. As the LCST-LLPS is an entropy-driven phase transition, the results of this study emphasize the role of entropy in solvent isotope effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Michal K.
