While in the past, the use of this device was reserved to glaucoma refractory to multiple filtration surgical procedures, up-to-date mounting experience has encouraged its use also as a primary surgery for selected cases. Implantation of Ahmed glaucoma valve can be challenging for the surgeon, especially in patients who already underwent previous multiple surgeries. Several tips have to be acquired by the surgeon, and a long learning curve is always needed. Although the valve mechanism embedded in the Ahmed glaucoma valve decreases the risk of postoperative hypotony-related complications, it does not avoid the need of a careful follow-up. Complications related to this type of surgery include early and late postoperative hypotony, excessive capsule fibrosis around the plate, erosion of the tube or plate edge, and very rarely infection. The aim of this review is to describe surgical technique for Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation and to report related complications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f15","authors":["Ivano Riva","Gloria Roberti","Francesco Oddone","Anastasios GP Konstas","Luciano Quaranta"],"doi":"10.2147\/opth.s104220","first_seen_on":"2017-02-20T02:08:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-5467","1177-5483"],"journal":"Clinical Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1502803973,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/ahmed-glaucoma-valve-implant-surgical-technique-and-complications-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH?utm_campaign=Contact+Quiboat+For+More+Referrer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=quiboat","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2147\/OPTH.S104220"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=34990","pmcid":"PMC5322839","pmid":"28255226","pubdate":"2017-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Ahmed glaucoma valve implant: surgical technique and complications","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ahmed-glaucoma-valve-implant-surgical-technique-complications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":859529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7485367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245385,"mean":13.704004295308,"rank":41679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":202928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245385,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1298,"mean":2.7035790285274,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1298,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.9321428571429,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
