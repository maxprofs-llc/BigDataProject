RNAP recognizes four main substrates: ATP, CTP, GTP and UTP. Experimental evidence from the past several years suggests that, besides these four NTPs, other molecules can be used to initiate transcription: (i) ribooligonucleotides (nanoRNAs) and (ii) coenzymes such as NAD(+), NADH, dephospho-CoA and FAD. The presence of these molecules at the 5' ends of RNAs affects the properties of the RNA. Here, we discuss the expanding portfolio of molecules that can initiate transcription, their mechanism of incorporation, effects on RNA and cellular processes, and we present an outlook toward other possible initiation substrates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c5","authors":["Ivan Barv\u00edk","Dominik Rejman","Natalya Panova","Hana \u0160anderov\u00e1","Libor Kr\u00e1sn\u00fd","Franz Narberhaus","Barv\u00edk, Ivan","Rejman, Dominik","Panova, Natalya","\u0160anderov\u00e1, Hana","Kr\u00e1sn\u00fd, Libor"],"doi":"10.1093\/femsre\/fuw041","first_seen_on":"2016-11-01T05:37:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1574-6976","0168-6445"],"journal":"FEMS Microbiology Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1491919529,"links":["http:\/\/m.femsre.oxfordjournals.org\/\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/30\/femsre.fuw041.abstract","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/femsre\/article-abstract\/41\/2\/131\/2674173\/Non-canonical-transcription-initiation-the#.WNLw2omHF_o.twitter","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/femsre\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/femsre\/fuw041"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/femsre\/article-pdf\/41\/2\/131\/10853128\/fuw041.pdf","pmid":"27799279","pubdate":"2016-10-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"fuw041","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Non-canonical transcription initiation: the expanding universe of transcription initiating substrates","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/femsre\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/femsre\/fuw041","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/noncanonical-transcription-initiation-expanding-universe-transcription-initiating-substrates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":4028862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3825169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239189,"mean":13.001204667458,"rank":122298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":108453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239189,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":475,"mean":6.850135021097,"rank":372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":475,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":17.715,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
