This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.\nThe objectives of this review are:to determine whether gene therapy can improve survival and prevent symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease;to examine the risks of gene therapy against the potential long-term gain for people with sickle cell disease.\nWe searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and searching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 15 August 2016.\nAll randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials (including any relevant phase 1, 2 or 3 trials) of gene therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease, regardless of age or setting.\nNo trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were found.\nNo trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported.\nNo randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials of gene therapy for sickle cell disease were reported. Thus, no objective conclusions or recommendations in practice can be made on gene therapy for sickle cell disease. This systematic review has identified the need for well-designed, randomised controlled trials to assess the benefits and risks of gene therapy for sickle cell disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc8c","authors":["Olowoyeye, Abiola","Okwundu, Charles I"],"doi":"10.1002\/14651858.cd007652.pub5","first_seen_on":"2016-11-24T14:02:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-493X","1465-1858"],"journal":"Cochrane database of systematic reviews","last_mentioned_on":1495050322,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD007652.pub5\/abstract","http:\/\/www.cochrane.org\/fr\/CD007652\/la-therapie-genique-pour-la-drepanocytose","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27841932"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD007652.pub5\/pdf","pmid":"27841932","pubdate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","medicine"],"title":"Gene therapy for sickle cell disease","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-therapy-sickle-cell-disease-17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":4.75,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":1687112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6525082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270487,"mean":12.025117336941,"rank":74515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":195744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270487,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8554,"mean":18.202244592541,"rank":4719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":3811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8554,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":31.819588785047,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
