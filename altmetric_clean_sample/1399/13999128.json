Three advanced practice nurses administered the FOUR score, GCS, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), and Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) concurrently from ICU admissions. The endpoint of observation was mortality when the patients left the ICU. Data are presented as frequency with percentages, mean with standard deviation, or median with interquartile range. Each measurement tool used area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to compare the predictive power between these four tools. In addition, the difference between survival and death was estimated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.\nFrom 55 TBI patients, males (72.73\u00a0%) were represented more than females, the mean age was 63.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.9, and 19 of 55 observations (35\u00a0%) had a maximum FOUR score of 16. The overall mortality rate was 14.6\u00a0%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 74.47\u00a0% for the FOUR score, 74.73\u00a0% for the GCS, 81.78\u00a0% for the APACHE II, and 53.32\u00a0% for the TISS. The FOUR score has similar predictive power of mortality compared to the GCS and APACHE II. Each of the parameters-E, M, B, and R-of the FOUR score showed a significant difference between mortality and survival group, while the verbal and eye-opening components of the GCS did not.\nHaving similar predictive power of mortality compared to the GCS and APACHE II, the FOUR score can be used as an alternative in the prediction of early mortality in TBI patients in the ICU.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000427c","authors":["Tee-Tau Eric Nyam","Kam-Hou Ao","Shu-Yu Hung","Mei-Li Shen","Tzu-Chieh Yu","Jinn-Rung Kuo"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12028-016-0326-y","first_seen_on":"2016-11-24T16:45:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1556-0961"],"journal":"Neurocritical Care","last_mentioned_on":1481901424,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12028-016-0326-y","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12028-016-0326-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12028-016-0326-y.pdf","pmid":"27873233","pubdate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare","neurology"],"title":"FOUR Score Predicts Early Outcome in Patients After Traumatic Brain Injury","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12028-016-0326-y","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/four-score-predicts-early-outcome-patients-after-traumatic-brain-injury-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.9,"score_history":{"1y":4.9,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7896890,"mean":6.6848881279648,"rank":1534599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6358855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7896890,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254476,"mean":12.106543919835,"rank":68873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":185363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254476,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":523,"mean":3.0289042145594,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":523,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.5184210526316,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeurocritCareJ\/statuses\/801829035768762368","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13999128],"posted_on":"2016-11-24T16:45:14+00:00","author":{"name":"NeurocritCareJournal","url":"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/medicine\/internal\/journal\/12028","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/747125201347842048\/WotjSixw_normal.jpg","description":"A Journal of Acute and Emergency Care.
