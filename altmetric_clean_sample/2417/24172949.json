Protein levels were analyzed with 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and unbiased clustering. High levels of rod outer segment proteins were not detected, suggesting that this was not a case of Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome. Instead, elevated levels of Hepcidin (HEPC) and Cystatin C (CYTC; candidate biomarkers for primary open angle glaucoma) were detected, suggesting a different, unknown etiology.\nMolecular diagnoses can differentiate between clinical diagnoses and point to common biomarkers or disease mechanisms.","authors":["Gabriel Velez","C.
