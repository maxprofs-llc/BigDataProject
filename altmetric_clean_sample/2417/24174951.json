The study also included 45 patients aged \u226520.\nOur study demonstrated that only 45% (n\u00a0=\u00a074) of PKU patients knew daily Phe intake recommendations, 27% of patients (n\u00a0=\u00a041) knew the Phe content in a minimum of three out of four researched food products. Patients' knowledge concerning Phe intake (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0181) and the knowledge of selected food products (p\u00a0=\u00a00.041819) improved with age. We did not establish such a correlation in the group of PKU children's parents. Approximately 31% of patients and 22% of parents reported helplessness, which increased with the child's age, associated with the necessity to adhere to the diet; 30% of patients reported feeling ashamed of the fact that they could not eat all food products. Regardless of age, children were more likely than parents to report helplessness (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032005). Among patients, 41.40% declared that they would wish to select products unassisted but their parents did not permit them to do so. The question of whether parents teach children self-reliance in meal preparation was answered affirmatively by 98% of parents and only 81% of children (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001).\nOur data demonstrated that parents' and children's knowledge concerning treatment recommendations and food products does not have a direct impact on attitude to the PKU diet. Limiting children's independence in meal selection, growing helplessness in the face of dietary adherence and shame resulting from the necessity to follow a different diet observed in PKU families are responsible for shaping and perpetuating a consistently negative attitude to the diet. The care of PKU paediatric patients requires consistent, long-term family and individual therapy which may counteract the effects of learned helplessness. In regard to the educational effort, a good parent-child relationship as well as the teaching of behaviours motivating patients to comply with the diet are of great importance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000087c","authors":["Ewa Witalis","Bozena Mikoluc","Radoslaw Motkowski","Jolanta Sawicka-Powierza","Agnieszka Chrobot","Bozena Didycz","Agata Lange","Renata Mozrzymas","Andrzej Milanowski","Maria Nowacka","Mariola Piotrowska-Depta","Hanna Romanowska","Ewa Starostecka","Jolanta Wierzba","Magdalena Skorniewska","Barbara Iwona Wojcicka-Bartlomiejczyk","Maria Gizewska","Halina Car","Ewa Witalis","Bozena Mikoluc","Radoslaw Motkowski","Jolanta Sawicka-Powierza","Agnieszka Chrobot","Bozena Didycz","Agata Lange","Renata Mozrzymas","Andrzej Milanowski","Maria Nowacka","Mariola Piotrowska-Depta","Hanna Romanowska","Ewa Starostecka","Jolanta Wierzba","Magdalena Skorniewska","Barbara Iwona Wojcicka-Bartlomiejczyk","Maria Gizewska","Halina Car"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12986-017-0207-1","first_seen_on":"2017-08-22T11:02:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1743-7075"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nutrition & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1503526729,"links":["https:\/\/nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12986-017-0207-1"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12986-017-0207-1?site=nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC5559804","pmid":"28824701","pubdate":"2017-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Nutrition","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Metabolic Diseases","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"57","title":"Phenylketonuria patients\u2019 and their parents\u2019 knowledge and attitudes to the daily diet - multi-centre study","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phenylketonuria-patients-parents-knowledge-attitudes-daily-diet-multicentre-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":4.75,"6m":4.75,"3m":4.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":1739929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6671740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170880,"mean":12.707806951117,"rank":43158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":127576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170880,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":531,"mean":20.649222641509,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":531,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.6,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
