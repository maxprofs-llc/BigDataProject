Seeking to clarify these issues will offer organized medicine an opportunity to deliver value-based health care. Context (patient, society, and clinician) is critical to finding that clarity, although the clinician context likely offers the best insights into how the ideal of high-value care may be incorporated into minimally invasive gynecologic surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002569","authors":["WHITESIDE, JAMES L."],"doi":"10.1097\/grf.0000000000000276","first_seen_on":"2017-08-22T11:31:14+00:00","issns":["0009-9201"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Obstetrics & Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1503401448,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/clinicalobgyn\/Abstract\/2017\/06000\/Finding_the_Value_of_Minimally_Invasive.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/clinicalobgyn\/2017\/06000\/Finding_the_Value_of_Minimally_Invasive.3.pdf","pmid":"28121645","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"223","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Finding the Value of Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/clinicalobgyn\/Fulltext\/2017\/06000\/Finding_the_Value_of_Minimally_Invasive.3.aspx","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/finding-value-minimally-invasive-gynecologic-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":6385403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1142252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168169,"mean":12.70469809952,"rank":119356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":30347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168169,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":957,"mean":2.1026464435146,"rank":677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":957,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.86666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ClinObGyn\/statuses\/899957017644736512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24175798],"posted_on":"2017-08-22T11:30:48+00:00","author":{"name":"ClinObGyn","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalobgyn.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1593299003\/COG_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Each issue of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology is a complete symposium on one or two timely topics of interest in obstetrics and gynecology.","id_on_source":"ClinObGyn","tweeter_id":"392937980","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1249},"tweet_id":"899957017644736512"}]}}
