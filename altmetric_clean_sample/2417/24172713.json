Although mutation\/loss of 22q has strongly established the loss of SMARCB1\/INI1 in cancers, the cause in CCs remains elusive. Recent studies suggest role of miRNAs in regulation of SMARCB1\/INI1 expressions. We examined 5 reported\/target predicted miRNAs to SMARCB1\/INI1 in SMARCB1\/INI1 immunonegative and immunopositive cases, and found upregulation of miR-671-5p and miR-193a-5p in SMARCB1\/INI1-immunonegative cases. Notably, these two miRNAs were significantly predicted to target TGF-\u03b2 signaling, suggestive of dysregulation of developmental and osteoblast regulation pathway in CCs. Overall, we suggest miR-671-5p- and miR-193a-5p-mediated epigenetic mode of SMARCB1\/INI1 loss and downregulated TGF-\u03b2 pathway in CCs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006ce9","authors":["Prit Benny Malgulwar","Pankaj Pathak","Manmohan Singh","Shashank Sharad Kale","Vaishali Suri","Chitra Sarkar","Mehar Chand Sharma"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10014-017-0295-7","first_seen_on":"2017-08-22T10:00:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1433-7398","1861-387X"],"journal":"Brain Tumor Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1503407344,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28825187?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28825187?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28825187","pubdate":"2017-08-20T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","pathology","brain"],"title":"Downregulation of SMARCB1\/INI1 expression in pediatric chordomas correlates with upregulation of miR-671-5p and miR-193a-5p expressions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/downregulation-smarcb1ini1-expression-pediatric-chordomas-correlates-upregulation-mir6715p-mir193a5p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":6385395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1142256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168168,"mean":12.70503133195,"rank":119356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":30347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168168,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":0.94375,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":6.29,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Epigenetica\/statuses\/899934258642530304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24172713],"posted_on":"2017-08-22T10:00:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Epigen\u00e9tica","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/433553138323181568\/5dEMj3Sj_normal.jpeg","description":"Feed de noticias relevantes en el campo de la Epigen\u00e9tica (ES\/CAT\/EN).
