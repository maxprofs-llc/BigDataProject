The skin of patients with AD presents as a disbalance of the microbiome with a strong colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, which positively correlates with the severity of the disease. However, the effect of colonized S. aureus on the skin immune system has not been fully elucidated.\nThe aim of this study is to explore whether S. aureus isolated from AD skin is able to skew T cell responses via Langerhans cells (LC) as compared to a standard strain of S. aureus and S. epidermidis.\nWe prepared monocyte-derived LC (MoLC) from healthy controls and patients with AD, and stimulated MoLC with a standard strain of S. aureus NCTC8325, S. aureus TF3378 isolated from AD skin, or S. epidermidis. Stimulated MoLC were co-cultured with autologous CD4(pos) T cells and then T cell responses were analyzed by T cell polarization assays, cytokine analysis and real-time PCR.\nMoLC stimulated by S. aureus TF3378 induced significantly high and rapid proliferation of T cells as compared to those by S. aureus NCTC8325 and S. epidermidis. Cytokine productions from T cells cultured with S. aureus TF3378-stimulated MoLC showed significantly high amounts of IL-2 and less IFN-\u03b3 production with imbalanced Th1\/Th2 (decreased TBX21\/GATA3 ratio) mRNA expression. The T cell proliferation with increased IL-2 production via S. aureus TF3378-stimulated MoLC was diminished by treatment of proteinase K.\nS. aureus TF3378 on AD skin can skew T cell responses via LC toward imbalanced Th1\/Th2 skin immunity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4f","authors":["Kazumasa Iwamoto","Masaya Moriwaki","Yoshie Niitsu","Masachika Saino","Shunsuke Takahagi","Junzo Hisatsune","Motoyuki Sugai","Michihiro Hide"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jdermsci.2017.08.001","first_seen_on":"2017-08-22T10:07:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["09231811","1873-569X"],"journal":"Journal of Dermatological Science","last_mentioned_on":1503991536,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28822698?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28822698"],"pmid":"28822698","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Staphylococcus aureus from atopic dermatitis skin alters cytokine production triggered by monocyte-derived Langerhans cell","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/staphylococcus-aureus-atopic-dermatitis-skin-alters-cytokine-production-triggered-monocytederived-la"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":6408593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1148397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185855,"mean":12.704953393524,"rank":132135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":33474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185855,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":458,"mean":3.2435492341357,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":458,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
