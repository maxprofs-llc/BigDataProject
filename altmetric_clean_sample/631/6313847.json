In this study, the effects of 20 nonalcoholic beverages on alcohol metabolism and liver injury caused by alcohol were evaluated in mice. Kunming mice were orally fed with alcohol (52%, v\/v) and beverages. The concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde in blood as well as the activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in liver were assessed to indicate alcohol metabolism. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in serum as well as the levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver were measured to reflect the alcohol-induced liver injury. The results showed that the treatment of soda water, green tea and honey chrysanthemum tea could accelerate ethanol metabolism and prevent liver injuries caused by alcohol when companied with excessive alcohol drinking. They might be potential dietary supplements for the alleviation of harmful effects from excessive alcohol consumption. On the contrary, some beverages such as fresh orange juice and red bull are not advised to drink when companied with alcohol consumption due to their adverse effects on ethanol induced liver injury.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Wang, Fang","Zhang, Yu-Jie","Zhou, Yue","Li, Ya","Zhou, Tong","Zheng, Jie","Zhang, Jiao-Jiao","Li, Sha","Xu, Dong-Ping","Li, Hua-Bin","Fang Wang","Yu-Jie Zhang","Yue Zhou","Ya Li","Tong Zhou","Jie Zheng","Jiao-Jiao Zhang","Sha Li","Dong-Ping Xu","Hua-Bin Li"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms17030354","first_seen_on":"2016-03-24T15:33:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1479647062,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27005619?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4813215\/pdf\/ijms-17-00354.pdf"],"pmid":"27005619","pubdate":"2016-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"354","title":"Effects of Beverages on Alcohol Metabolism: Potential Health Benefits and Harmful Impacts","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-beverages-alcohol-metabolism-potential-health-benefits-harmful-impacts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7719347,"mean":6.622418915792,"rank":3541611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4003427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7719347,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278148,"mean":11.056548932758,"rank":127859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":140706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278148,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4827,"mean":2.2400393700787,"rank":1199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":3422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4827,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":2.6628903225806,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RoanokeTavern\/statuses\/713021987375882243","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6313847],"posted_on":"2016-03-24T15:17:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Stephen","url":"http:\/\/q.gs\/23c1R","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2358584914\/7mqo0ezv5agzqk2frzmq_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"RoanokeTavern","tweeter_id":"176353026","geo":{"lt":47.57065,"ln":-122.22207,"country":"US"},"followers":2357},"tweet_id":"713021987375882243"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/manoloacosta2\/statuses\/800323901565927424","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6313847],"posted_on":"2016-11-20T13:04:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Manuel Acosta","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/485468723550388224\/knU4n5bI_normal.jpeg","description":"Miembro SEFH y SEFAC.Vocal COFLP Docencia.
