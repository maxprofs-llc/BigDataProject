In the present study, we evaluated the relationship between NKG2D ligand expression and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in in vitro culture systems of a panel of gastric cancer cell lines (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and clinical samples (n\u00a0=\u00a0102).\nFirst, the surface expression of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands (MICA, MICB, ULBP-2, and ULBP-3) on tumor cells was markedly downregulated on in vitro culture, in parallel to the upregulation of MMPs analyzed by gelatin zymography and gene expression microarray, whereas the transcript levels of NKG2D ligands remained unchanged on in vitro culture. Second, MMP-specific inhibitors could restore the downregulated expression of NKG2D ligands and functionally improve susceptibilities to NK cells in vitro. Third, the production of soluble NKG2D ligands was increased on in vitro culture and was inhibited by MMP-specific inhibitors. Finally, there was a significant inverse correlation between MMP-9 expression and NKG2D ligand expression as analyzed by immunohistochemistry in clinical tumor samples.\nThe present study is a comprehensive study demonstrating that upregulation of MMP activity can induce a downregulation of expression of NKG2D ligands in gastric cancer cells, leading to lower-level susceptibility to NK cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db6","authors":["Shiraishi, Kensuke","Mimura, Kousaku","Kua, Ley-Fang","Koh, Vivien","Siang, Lim Kee","Nakajima, Shotaro","Fujii, Hideki","Shabbir, Asim","Yong, Wei-Peng","So, Jimmy","Takenoshita, Seiichi","Kono, Koji"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00535-016-1197-x","first_seen_on":"2016-03-24T14:09:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1435-5922","0944-1174"],"journal":"Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1458822845,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27002316?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27002316","pubdate":"2016-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Abdominal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Colorectal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Inhibition of MMP activity can restore NKG2D ligand expression in gastric cancer, leading to improved NK cell susceptibility","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-mmp-activity-restore-nkg2d-ligand-expression-gastric-cancer-leading-improved-nk-cell-susc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7435912,"mean":6.4641587488024,"rank":3824540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2081864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7435912,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275322,"mean":11.001736206101,"rank":149995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":97441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275322,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":399,"mean":2.2237738693467,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":399,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.32375,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
