The new indium polymeric frameworks, namely [In8 (OH)6 (popha)6 (H2 O)4 ]\u22c53\u2009H2 O (InPF-16), [In(popha)(2,2'-bipy)]\u22c53\u2009H2 O (InPF-17), [In3 (OH)3 (popha)2 (4,4'-bipy)]\u22c54\u2009H2 O (InPF-18), [In2 (popha)2 (4,4'-bipy)2 ]\u22c53\u2009H2 O (InPF-19), [In(OH)(Hpopha)]\u22c50.5\u2009(1,7-phen) (InPF-20), and [In(popha)(1,10-phen)]\u22c54\u2009H2 O (InPF-21) (InPF=indium polymeric framework, H3 popha=5-(4-carboxy-2-nitrophenoxy)isophthalic acid, phen=phenanthroline, bipy=bipyridine), have been hydrothermally obtained by using both conventional heating (CH) and microwave (MW) procedures. These indium frameworks show efficient Lewis acid behavior for the solvent-free cyanosilylation of carbonyl compounds, the one pot Passerini 3-component (P-3CR) and the Ugi 4-component (U-4CR) reactions. In addition, InPF-17 was found to be a highly reactive, recyclable, and environmentally benign catalyst, which allows the efficient synthesis of \u03b1-aminoacyl amides. The relationship between the Lewis base\/acid active site and the catalytic performance is explained by the 2D seven-coordinated indium framework of the catalyst InPF-17. This study is an attempt to highlight the main structural and synthetic factors that have to be taken into account when planning a new, effective MOF-based heterogeneous catalyst for multicomponent reactions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Aguirre\u2010D\u00edaz, Lina Mar\u00eda","Iglesias, Marta","Snejko, Natalia","Guti\u00e9rrez\u2010Puebla, Enrique","Monge, M. \u00c1ngeles"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201504576","endpage":"6665","first_seen_on":"2016-03-24T17:40:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"19","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1458851733,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/chem.201504576&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/chem.201504576"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201504576\/pdf","pmid":"27010759","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"6654","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synchronizing Substrate Activation Rates in Multicomponent Reactions with Metal\u2013Organic Framework Catalysts","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synchronizing-substrate-activation-rates-multicomponent-reactions-metalorganic-framework-catalysts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7435912,"mean":6.4641587488024,"rank":3610870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3637443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7435912,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275322,"mean":11.001862967227,"rank":138342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":126611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275322,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5170,"mean":3.1007320564906,"rank":1914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3067,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5170,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315,"mean":3.7885541401274,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
