We examined CVD preventive care processes from RA patient and provider perspectives to develop a process map to identify targets for future interventions to improve CVD preventive care.\nThirty-one participants (15 patients, 7 rheumatologists, 9 primary care physicians (PCPs)) participated in interviews, which were coded using NVivo software and analyzed using grounded theory techniques.\nPatients and providers reported that receipt of preventive care depends upon identifying and acting on risk factors, although most noted that both processes rarely occurred. Engagement in these processes was influenced by various provider, system, visit and patient-related conditions-such as patient activation or knowledge about their risk. While nearly half of patients and PCPs were unaware of RA-CVD risk, all rheumatologists were aware of risk. Rheumatologists reported not systematically identifying risk factors, or, if identified, described communicating about CVD risk factors via clinic notes to PCPs instead of acting directly due to perceived role boundaries. PCPs suggested that scheduling PCP visits could improve CVD risk management, and all participants viewed co-management positively.\nFindings from this study illustrate important gaps and opportunities to support identifying and acting on CVD risk factors in RA patients from the provider, system, visit, and patient levels. Future work should investigate professional role support through improved guidelines, patient activation, and system-based RA-CVD preventive care strategies. This article is protected by copyright.
