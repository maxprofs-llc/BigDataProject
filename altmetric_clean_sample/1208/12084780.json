It is therefore necessary to establish an appropriate working model to study and monitor radiation-mediated cancer therapy. In response to cellular stress, the metabolome is the integrated profiling of changes in all metabolites in cells, which can be used to investigate radiation tolerance mechanisms and identify targets for cancer radiation sensibilization. In this study, using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance for untargeted metabolic profiling in radiation-tolerant mouse melanoma cell line B16, we comprehensively investigated changes in metabolites and metabolic network in B16 cells in response to radiation. Principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis indicated the difference in cellular metabolites between the untreated cells and X-ray radiated cells. In radiated cells, the content of alanine, glutamate, glycine and choline was increased, while the content of leucine, lactate, creatine and creatine phosphate was decreased. Enrichment analysis of metabolic pathway showed that the changes in metabolites were related to multiple metabolic pathways including the metabolism of glycine, arginine, taurine, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Taken together, with cellular metabolome study followed by bioinformatic analysis to profile specific metabolic pathways in response to radiation, we deepened our understanding of radiation-resistant mechanisms and radiation sensibilization in cancer, which may further provide a theoretical and practical basis for personalized cancer therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Lige Wu","Zixi Hu","Yingying Huang","Yating Yu","Wei Liang","Qinghui Zheng","Xianing Huang","Yong Huang","Xiaoling Lu","Yongxiang Zhao"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0162917","first_seen_on":"2016-09-19T14:06:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1474038754,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162917"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162917.PDF","pmid":"27631970","pubdate":"2016-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0162917","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Radiation Changes the Metabolic Profiling of Melanoma Cell Line B16","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiation-changes-metabolic-profiling-melanoma-cell-line-b16"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":7251779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253940,"mean":12.653889760926,"rank":210121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253940,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115757,"mean":10.634830246381,"rank":97569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115757,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4207,"mean":9.7015064194009,"rank":3649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4207,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
