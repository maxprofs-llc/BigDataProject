Pharaoh ant colony movements induced by several types of disturbances were evaluated in the laboratory. The percentages of workers and brood in the source and new nest sites were determined at Days 0, 1, 3, and 5 following physical disturbance (temporal removal of nestmates), chemical disturbance (application of pyrethroid insecticide), invasion by heterospecific ants, food depletion, and moisture depletion in the laboratory. All disturbances were performed in the source nest, which was connected to an empty new nest site. Almost all workers moved and carried the entire brood to the new nest site when subjected to physical disturbance, chemical disturbance, and ant invasion on Day 1, whereas only <5% of workers were present in the new nest site in the undisturbed control. After these disturbances, the brood was never relocated back to the original nest site in this 5-d study. When subjected to food depletion, \u223c60% of the brood were found in the new nest site and \u223c40% of the brood remained in the original nest on Day 5, resulting in a polydomous population. In contrast, moisture depletion did not show any significant effect on colony movement. These results provide useful information about the causes of Pharaoh ant colony budding and guidance about how to develop effective control and prevention strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006631","authors":["Jia-Wei Tay","Chow-Yang Lee"],"doi":"10.1093\/jee\/tov079","endpage":"1242","first_seen_on":"2016-09-19T12:51:35+00:00","issns":["0022-0493","1938-291X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Economic Entomology","last_mentioned_on":1474210800,"links":["http:\/\/jee.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/jee\/108\/3\/1237.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jee.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/jee\/108\/3\/1237.full.pdf","pmid":"26470251","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecological Applications","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1237","title":"Induced Disturbances Cause Monomorium pharaonis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Nest Relocation","type":"article","volume":"108","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/induced-disturbances-cause-monomorium-pharaonis-hymenoptera-formicidae-nest-relocation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":7258099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254022,"mean":12.656007393089,"rank":210062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254022,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1415,"mean":4.822224893918,"rank":1197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1415,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":5.5896153846154,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Ph.
