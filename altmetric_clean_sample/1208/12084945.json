This systematic review gives an overview of such QIs measuring processes of care for chronic kidney disease (CKD), and identifies the QIs that have content, face, operational and\/or predictive validity.\nPubMed and Embase were searched using a strategy combining the terms \"quality of care,\" \"quality indicators\" and \"chronic kidney disease\". Papers were included if they focused on developing, testing or applying QIs for assessing the quality of care in adult patients with CKD not on renal replacement therapy.\nTwo hundred and seventy-three QIs from thirty-one papers were extracted, including QIs on adequate monitoring of kidney function and vascular risk factors, on indicated treatment, drug safety, adherence and referral to a specialist. The QIs that were considered content, face and operational valid focused on monitoring of glomerular filtration rate, albumin-creatinine ratio, lipid levels and blood pressure, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nitrofurantoin and biphosphonates in patients with CKD, and QIs on monitoring haemoglobin and treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors\/angiotensin-receptor-II-blockers in patients with CKD and comorbidities. No QIs were tested for predictive validity. In addition, only two QIs focused on diet and no other QIs focused on lifestyle management.\nBased on this review, sufficiently validated QIs can be selected for measuring the quality of CKD care. This review provides insight in QIs that need further validation, and in areas of care where QIs are still lacking.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000599d","authors":["Smits, Kirsten P.J.","Sidorenkov, Grigory","Bilo, Henk J.G.","Bouma, Margriet","Navis, Gerjan J.","Denig, Petra","Smits, Kirsten P J","Bilo, Henk J G","Navis, Gerjan J","Kirsten P.J.
