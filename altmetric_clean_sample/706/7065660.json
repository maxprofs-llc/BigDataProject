Five types of fuels (ethanol, glycerol, acetate, propionate and fructose) have been tested for the same organic load (5,000\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1) measured as COD) and for one of them (acetate), the range of dosages between 500 and 20,000\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1) of COD was also studied. Results demonstrate that production of electricity depends strongly on the fuel used. Carboxylic acids are much more efficient than alcohols or fructose for the same organic load and within the range 500-5,000\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1) of acetate the production of electricity increases linearly with the amount of acetate fed but over these concentrations a change in the population composition may explain a worse performance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003717","authors":["Y.
