The aim of the present study was to identify models of care that incorporate district hospitals and have relevance to the Australian rural and remote context.Methods A systematic, rapid review was conducted of published peer-reviewed and grey literature using CINAHL, Medline, PsychInfo, APAIS-Health, ATSI health, Health Collection, Health & Society, Meditext, RURAL, PubMed and Google Scholar. Search terms included 'rural', 'small general and district hospitals', 'rural health services organisation & administration', 'medically underserved area', 'specific conditions, interventions, monitoring and evaluation', 'regional, rural and remote communities', 'NSW', 'Australia' and 'other OECD countries' between 2002 and 2013. Models of teaching and education, multipurpose services centres, recruitment and\/or retention were excluded.Results The search yielded 1626 articles and reports. Following removal of duplicates, initial screening and full text screening, 24 data sources remained: 21 peer-reviewed publications and three from the grey literature. Identified models of care related specifically to maternal and child health, end-of-life care, cancer care services, Aboriginal health, mental health, surgery and emergency care.Conclusion District hospitals play an important role in the delivery of care, particularly at key times in a person's life (birth, death, episodes of illness). They enable people to remain in or near their own community with support from a range of services. They also play an important role in the essential fabric of the community and the vertical integration of the health services.What is known about the topic? Little has been published on the function of small-to-medium district hospitals in rural and remote Australia, and almost nothing is known about models of care that are relevant to these settings.What does this paper add? District hospitals form an important part of vertically integrated models of care in Australia. Effective models of care aim to keep health services close to home. There is scope for networked models of care that keep health care within the community supported by hub-and-spoke models of service delivery.What are the implications for practitioners? This review found limited evidence on the skill mix required in district hospitals; however, the skill mix underpins the extent of service and speciality that can be provided locally, particularly with regard to the provision of surgery and emergency services. International evidence suggests that providing surgical services locally can help increase the sustainability of smaller hospitals because they typically provide high return, short episodes of care; however, this depends on the funding model being used. Similarly, the skill mix of staff required to sustain a functioning emergency department brings a skill base that supports a higher level of expertise across the hospital.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002367","authors":["Nancarrow, Susan A","Roots, Alison","Grace, Sandra","Saberi, Vahid"],"doi":"10.1071\/ah14137","first_seen_on":"2016-04-29T03:01:27+00:00","issns":["0156-5788"],"issue":"5","journal":"Australian Health Review","last_mentioned_on":1462018234,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26278639"],"pmid":"26278639","pubdate":"2015-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"494","subjects":["nursing","healthservices","hospitals"],"title":"Models of care involving district hospitals: a rapid review to inform the Australian rural and remote context","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/models-care-involving-district-hospitals-rapid-review-inform-australian-rural-remote-context"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7628277,"mean":6.5635637575213,"rank":3298349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4244043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7628277,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266786,"mean":11.394369541016,"rank":111532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":151287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266786,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":467,"mean":3.7528497854077,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":467,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.6175,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
