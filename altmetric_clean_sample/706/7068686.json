The relationship between XRCC3 polymorphisms and the risk of radiation-induced adverse effects on normal tissue remains inconclusive. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the association between XRCC3 polymorphisms and radiation-induced adverse effects on normal tissue. All eligible studies up to December 2014 were identified through a search of the PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases. Seventeen studies involving 656 cases and 2193 controls were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the association between XRCC3 polymorphisms and the risk of radiation-induced normal tissue adverse effects. We found that the XRCC3 p.Thr241Met (rs861539) polymorphism was significantly associated with early adverse effects induced by radiotherapy (OR = 1.99, 95%CI: 1.31-3.01, P = 0.001). A positive association lacking statistical significance with late adverse effects was also identified (OR = 1.28, 95%CI: 0.97-1.68, P = 0.08). In addition, the rs861539 polymorphism was significantly correlated with a higher risk of adverse effects induced by head and neck area irradiation (OR = 2.41, 95%CI: 1.49-3.89, p = 0.0003) and breast irradiation (OR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.02-1.95, p = 0.04), whereas the correlation was not significant for lung irradiation or pelvic irradiation. Furthermore, XRCC3 rs1799794 polymorphism may have a protective effect against late adverse effects induced by radiotherapy (OR = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.26-0.86, P = 0.01). Well-designed large-scale clinical studies are required to further validate our results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Song, Yu-Zhe","Han, Fu-Jun","Liu, Min","Xia, Cheng-Cheng","Shi, Wei-Yan","Dong, Li-Hua"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0130388","first_seen_on":"2016-04-29T10:23:03+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1461924564,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26091483?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26091483","pubdate":"2015-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Association between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in XRCC3 and Radiation-Induced Adverse Effects on Normal Tissue: A Meta-Analysis.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-single-nucleotide-polymorphisms-xrcc3-radiationinduced-adverse-effects-normal-ti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7625034,"mean":6.5623772256419,"rank":6600103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7625034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266765,"mean":11.394514079861,"rank":223483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266765,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108557,"mean":10.217474796419,"rank":91628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108557,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4994,"mean":13.066669337072,"rank":4421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4994,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/725989424035581952","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7068686],"posted_on":"2016-04-29T10:05:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"725989424035581952"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/725990359742861312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7068686],"posted_on":"2016-04-29T10:09:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"725990359742861312"}]}}
