The cluster-based computational methodology employs pseudoatoms to reduce the net charge (resulting from missing co-ordination on the terminal atoms) through valence modification of terminal atoms using bond-valence theory (VMTA\/BV). The magnetic-shielding tensors computed with the VMTA\/BV method are compared to magnetic-shielding tensors determined with the periodic GIPAW approach. The cluster-based all-electron calculations agree with experiment better than the GIPAW calculations, particularly for predicting absolute magnetic shielding and for predicting chemical shifts. The performance of the DFT functionals CA-PZ, PW91, PBE, rPBE, PBEsol, WC, and PBE0 are assessed for the prediction of (29) Si and (31) P magnetic-shielding constants. Calculations using the hybrid functional PBE0, in combination with the VMTA\/BV approach, result in excellent agreement with experiment. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fa6","authors":["Holmes, Sean T.","Alkan, Fahri","Iuliucci, Robbie J.","Mueller, Karl T.","Dybowski, Cecil"],"doi":"10.1002\/jcc.24389","endpage":"1710","first_seen_on":"2016-04-28T19:47:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1096-987X"],"issue":"18","journal":"Journal of Computational Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1461872827,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcc.24389\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcc.24389\/pdf","pmid":"27117609","pubdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
