Genomic effects are largely mediated by SCF(TIR1\/AFB)-Aux\/IAA auxin receptor complexes whereas it has been postulated that AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) controls the non-genomic effects. However, the roles of ABP1 in auxin signaling and plant development were recently called into question. In this paper, we present recent progress in understanding the SCF(TIR1\/AFB)-Aux\/IAA pathway. In more detail, we discuss the current understanding of ABP1 research and provide an updated view of ABP1-related genetic materials. Further, we propose a model in which auxin efflux carriers may play a role in auxin perception and we briefly describe recent insight on processes downstream of auxin perception.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a8","authors":["Lucia C.
