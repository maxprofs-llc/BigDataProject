Over the most recent 5-year period (2007\/2008 to 2011\/2012), on average 20.8% (95% CI 19.7% to 21.9%) of lumbar surgery patients met criteria for PPP. Rates of healthcare usage were significantly higher for patients with PPP across all types of care. Over 2\u2009years following initial spine surgery, the mean cost difference between patients with and without PPP was \u00a35383 (95% CI \u00a34872 to \u00a35916). Over 5 and 10 years following initial spine surgery, the mean cost difference between patients with and without PPP increased to \u00a310 195 (95% CI \u00a38726 to \u00a311\u2009669) and \u00a314 318 (95% CI \u00a38386 to \u00a319\u2009771), respectively. Extrapolated to the UK population, we estimate that nearly 5000 adults experience PPP after spine surgery annually, with each new cohort costing the UK National Health Service in excess of \u00a370\u2009million over the first 10 years alone.\nPersistent pain affects more than one-in-five lumbar surgery patients and accounts for substantial long-term healthcare costs. There is a need for formal, evidence-based guidelines for a coherent, coordinated management strategy for patients with continuing pain after lumbar surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Sharada Weir","Mihail Samnaliev","Tzu-Chun Kuo","Caitriona Ni Choitir","Travis S Tierney","David Cumming","Julie Bruce","Andrea Manca","Rod S Taylor","Sam Eldabe","Weir, Sharada","Samnaliev, Mihail","Kuo, Tzu-Chun","Ni Choitir, Caitriona","Tierney, Travis S","Cumming, David","Bruce, Julie","Manca, Andrea","Taylor, Rod S","Eldabe, Sam"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2017-017585","first_seen_on":"2017-09-12T06:24:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"9","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1506838708,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/7\/9\/e017585.full.pdf","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28893756?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28893756?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/9\/e017585","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/9\/e017585.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/7\/9\/e017585.full.pdf","pmid":"28893756","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e017585","title":"The incidence and healthcare costs of persistent postoperative pain following lumbar spine surgery in the UK: a cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)","type":"article","volume":"7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.2,"score_history":{"1y":15.2,"6m":15.2,"3m":15.2,"1m":15.2,"1w":2.35,"6d":2.35,"5d":1.5,"4d":1.5,"3d":1.5,"2d":1.5,"1d":0,"at":15.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462593,"mean":7.1086032149407,"rank":581600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7879963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462593,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155192,"mean":11.833569279146,"rank":16875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":138289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155192,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6357,"mean":17.117825676526,"rank":1199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6357,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":393,"mean":10.444821428571,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":393,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":17,"researcher":3,"practitioner":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":17,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Scientists":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1,"AU":2,"FI":1,"GB":8,"CA":2,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PhysioMeScience\/statuses\/907490106336047104","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25136324],"posted_on":"2017-09-12T06:24:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Physio Meets Science","url":"http:\/\/www.physiomeetsscience.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/769237060871983105\/pMkvPtJ5_normal.jpg","description":"critical therapists in the field of physiotherapy, pain and movement science","id_on_source":"PhysioMeScience","tweeter_id":"769235186160640001","geo":{"lt":49.40768,"ln":8.69079,"country":"DE"},"followers":2827},"tweet_id":"907490106336047104"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FaisalOusi\/statuses\/907496294943424517","license":"gnip","rt":["PhysioMeScience"],"citation_ids":[25136324],"posted_on":"2017-09-12T06:49:11+00:00","author":{"name":"\u0641\u064a\u0635\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0641\u0647\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0633\u064a","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/472278581494546432\/xIdiyPbI_normal.png","description":"Human being","id_on_source":"FaisalOusi","tweeter_id":"375722781","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":602},"tweet_id":"907496294943424517"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Brianmhcho\/statuses\/907546932612030464","license":"gnip","rt":["PhysioMeScience"],"citation_ids":[25136324],"posted_on":"2017-09-12T10:10:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Cho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/568729490814038016\/INactdY4_normal.jpeg","description":"Physiotherapist.
