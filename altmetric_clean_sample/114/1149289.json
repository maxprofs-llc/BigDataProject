Since we have previously shown that galectin-3 deficient (LGALS3(-\/-) ) mice are relatively resistant to diabetes induction, the aim of this study was to examine whether beta cell apoptosis depends on the presence of galectin-3 and to delineate the underlying mechanism. Deficiency of galectin-3, either hereditary or induced through application of chemical inhibitors, \u03b2-lactose or TD139, supported survival and function of islet beta cells compromised by TNF-\u03b1\u2009+\u2009IFN-\u03b3\u2009+\u2009IL-1\u03b2 stimulus. Similarly, inhibition of galectin-3 by \u03b2-lactose or TD139 reduced cytokine-triggered apoptosis of beta cells, leading to conclusion that endogenous galectin-3 propagates beta apoptosis in the presence of an inflammatory milieu. Exploring apoptosis-related molecules expression in primary islet cells before and after treatment with cytokines we found that galectin-3 ablation affected the expression of major components of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, such as BAX, caspase-9, Apaf, SMAC, caspase-3, and AIF. In contrast, anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were up-regulated in LGALS3(-\/-) islet cells when compared to wild-type (WT) counterparts (C57BL\/6), resulting in increased ratio of anti-apoptotic versus pro-apoptotic molecules. However, Fas-triggered apoptotic pathway as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1\/2 (ERK1\/2) was not influenced by LGALS-3 deletion. All together, these results point to an important role of endogenous galectin-3 in beta cell apoptosis in the inflammatory milieu that occurs during diabetes pathogenesis and implicates impairment of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as a key event in protection from beta cell apoptosis in the absence of galectin-3.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f93","authors":["Saksida, Tamara","Nikolic, Ivana","Vujicic, Milica","Nilsson, Ulf J.","Leffler, Hakon","Lukic, Miodrag L.","Stojanovic, Ivana","Stosic\u2010Grujicic, Stanislava"],"doi":"10.1002\/jcp.24318","endpage":"1576","first_seen_on":"2013-01-01T08:06:53+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1097-4652","0021-9541"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Cellular Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1357043071,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcp.24318\/abstract;jsessionid=F6E947BAFA039E0FE4A7C71933023061.d04t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcp.24318\/pdf","pmid":"23280610","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1568","subjects":["cellbiology","physiology"],"title":"Galectin\u00e2\u0080\u00903 deficiency protects pancreatic islet cells from cytokine\u00e2\u0080\u0090triggered apoptosis in vitro","type":"article","volume":"228","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/galectin3-deficiency-protects-pancreatic-islet-cells-cytokinetriggered-apoptosis-vitro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6284858,"mean":5.9828314038018,"rank":4419414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1638968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6284858,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271094,"mean":6.6311900491714,"rank":167360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":90161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271094,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":994,"mean":2.1408942598187,"rank":568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":994,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":1.6303921568627,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
