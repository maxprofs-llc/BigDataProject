Classical causes of structural and metabolic myopathy were initially considered before clinical and biological features of vitamin D deficiency rickets were identified. Prompt treatment with vitamin D and calcium supplementation led to a complete reversal of the muscle symptoms. Rickets-associated myopathy should be included in the differential diagnosis of proximal myopathy, especially in at-risk individuals. Vitamin D deficiency and its prevention remain important health issues in industrialized countries.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002425","doi":"10.1016\/j.braindev.2012.11.014","first_seen_on":"2013-01-01T12:36:46+00:00","issns":["1872-7131"],"journal":"Brain & Development","last_mentioned_on":1357042953,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23273989?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23273989","pubdate":"2012-12-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Japanese Society of Child Neurology","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","pediatrics"],"title":"Vitamin D deficiency: A forgotten treatable cause of motor delay and proximal myopathy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-deficiency-forgotten-treatable-cause-motor-delay-proximal-myopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3071108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":947868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283277,"mean":5.9596053883843,"rank":190514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":52969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283277,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":362,"mean":1.8995290858726,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":362,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.8,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
