Here we describe the regulatome of NOD2 signaling using a systematic RNAi screen. Using three consecutive screens, we identified a set of 20 positive NF-\u03baB regulators including the known pathway members RIPK2, RELA, and BIRC4 (XIAP) as well as FRMPD2 (FERM and PDZ domain-containing 2). FRMPD2 interacts with NOD2 via leucine-rich repeats and forms a complex with the membrane-associated protein ERBB2IP. We demonstrate that FRMPD2 spatially assembles the NOD2-signaling complex, hereby restricting NOD2-mediated immune responses to the basolateral compartment of polarized intestinal epithelial cells. We show that genetic truncation of the NOD2 leucine-rich repeat domain, which is associated with Crohn disease, impairs the interaction with FRMPD2, and that intestinal inflammation leads to down-regulation of FRMPD2. These results suggest a structural mechanism for how polarity of epithelial cells acts on intestinal NOD-like receptor signaling to mediate spatial specificity of bacterial recognition and control of immune responses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Simone Lipinski","Nils Grabe","Gunnar Jacobs","Susanne Billmann-Born","Andreas Till","Robert H\u00e4sler","Konrad Aden","Maren Paulsen","Alexander Arlt","Lars Kraemer","Nina Hagemann","Kai Sven Erdmann","Stefan Schreiber","Philip Rosenstiel","Lipinski S","Grabe N","Jacobs G","Billmann-Born S","Till A","H\u00e4sler R","Aden K","Paulsen M","Arlt A","Kraemer L","Hagemann N","Erdmann KS","Schreiber S","Rosenstiel P","S.
