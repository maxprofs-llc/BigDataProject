In addition, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGF-A have been shown to affect gene expression and process of angiogenesis. The present study evaluated the correlations between SNPs in VEGF-A and gastric cancer survival. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 404 gastric cancer patients and blood samples from 404 controls were included in the study. The SNPs -460T\/C (rs833061), +405G\/C (rs2101963), -7C\/T (rs25648) and +936C\/T (rs3025039) were genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We showed patients carrying the +405GG genotype had significantly worse survival in the N0 (lymph-node negative), N0L0 (lymph-node negative and lymphovascular-invasion negative) and TNM stage I-II subgroups (P = 0.021, P = 0.007 and P = 0.017, respectively). In addition, haplotype -460T\/+405G\/-7C and -460C\/+405G\/-7C carriers showed poor survival in the N0, N0L0 and TNM stage I-II subgroups (P = 0.004, P = 0.030 and P = 0.009 for TGC; P = 0.033, P = 0.049 and P = 0.011 for CGC). Overall, the +405 GG genotype or TGC and CGC haplotypes were correlated with poor survival in TNM stage I-II gastric cancer patients. The +405G\/C polymorphism of VEGF-A could be used as a biomarker for molecular staging in stage I-II gastric cancer in Northern China.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081dd","doi":"10.1007\/s11033-012-2365-6","first_seen_on":"2012-12-25T12:12:35+00:00","issns":["1573-4978"],"journal":"Molecular Biology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1356436923,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23264084?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23264084","pubdate":"2012-12-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Anatomy \/ Morphology \/ Histology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Biochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Positive association of the vascular endothelial growth factor-A +405 GG genotype and poor survival in stage I-II gastric cancer in the Northern Chinese population.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-association-vascular-endothelial-growth-factora-405-gg-genotype-poor-survival-stage-iii-gas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":4185515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286924,"mean":6.1562876451173,"rank":236323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286924,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":679,"mean":1.459784660767,"rank":449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":679,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.2340714285714,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/status\/283543124612091904","citation_ids":[1142106],"posted_on":"2012-12-25T12:02:03+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"283543124612091904"}]}}
