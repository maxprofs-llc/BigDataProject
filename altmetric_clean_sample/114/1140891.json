For the first time, the guideline includes nine specific recommendations for the assessment and treatment of PTSD-related anger, irritability, and agitation. This article will review the literature on PTSD and its association with anger and aggression. We highlight explanatory models for these associations, factors that contribute to the occurrence of anger and aggression in PTSD, assessment of anger and aggression, and effective anger management interventions and strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002efe","authors":["Taft CT","Creech SK","Kachadourian L"],"first_seen_on":"2012-12-24T02:48:25+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Rehabilitation Research & Development","last_mentioned_on":1356317268,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23015585?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23015585","pubdate":"2012-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Assessment and treatment of posttraumatic anger and aggression: A review.","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-treatment-posttraumatic-anger-aggression-review-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":959759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283163,"mean":5.9298053199229,"rank":193412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283163,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":1.6658829787234,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.98888888888889,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
