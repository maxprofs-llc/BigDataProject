Nevertheless, the issue of a correlation between declarative memory performance and hippocampal volume in healthy subjects still remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to investigate this relationship in more detail. For this purpose, 50 healthy young male participants performed the California Verbal Learning Test. Hippocampal volume was assessed by manual segmentation of high-resolution 3D magnetic resonance images. We found a significant positive correlation between putatively hippocampus-dependent memory measures like short-delay retention, long-delay retention and discriminability and percent hippocampal volume. No significant correlation with measures related to executive processes was found. In addition, percent amygdala volume was not related to any of these measures. Our data advance previous findings reported in studies of brain-damaged individuals in a large and homogeneous young healthy sample and are important for theories on the neural basis of episodic memory.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000242b","authors":["Pohlack ST","Meyer P","Cacciaglia R","Liebscher C","Ridder S","Flor H"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00429-012-0497-z","first_seen_on":"2013-01-01T17:27:59+00:00","issns":["1863-2653"],"issue":"","journal":"Brain Structure & Function","last_mentioned_on":1357039885,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23269366"],"pmid":"23269366","pubdate":"2012-12-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Bigger is better!
