We investigate the utility of prospective serum screening as a surrogate diagnostic marker for progranulin mutations. A commercial ELISA was used to measure progranulin protein concentration in serum from 63 FTD patients and 32 normal controls, and DNA screening then performed. Four patients (2\/17 behavioral variant, 2\/8 corticobasal syndrome) had abnormally low progranulin levels with PGRN mutations confirmed on DNA testing. Surprisingly, elevated levels were found in 6\/16 patients with progressive non-fluent aphasia, the significance of which is unclear. Serum testing is an accurate and cost effective means of predicting PGRN mutations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Schofield EC","Halliday GM","Kwok J","Loy C","Double KL","Hodges JR"],"doi":"10.3233\/jad-2010-101032","first_seen_on":"2012-12-31T09:46:35+00:00","issns":["1387-2877"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","last_mentioned_on":1356947191,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20858962"],"pmid":"20858962","pubdate":"2010-09-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"Low serum progranulin predicts the presence of mutations: a prospective study.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-serum-progranulin-predicts-presence-mutations-prospective-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8381513,"mean":7.0626122897557,"rank":7245442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8381513,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298175,"mean":6.9091888561712,"rank":249832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298175,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2484,"mean":15.641252517116,"rank":2325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2484,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":5.9217333333333,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
