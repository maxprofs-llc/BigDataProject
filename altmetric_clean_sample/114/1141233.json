In addition, CART is a regulator of neuronal survival. In this study, we examined the effect of exogenous CART 55-102 on beta cell viability and dissected its signaling mechanisms. Evaluation of DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation revealed that CART 55-102 reduced glucotoxicity-induced apoptosis in both INS-1 (832\/13) cells and isolated rat islets. Glucotoxicity in INS-1 (832\/13) cells also caused a 50% reduction of endogenous CART protein. We show that CART increased proliferation in INS-1 (832\/13) cells, an effect that was blocked by PKA, PKB, and MEK1 inhibitors. In addition, CART induced phosphorylation of CREB, IRS, PKB, FoxO1, p44\/42 MAPK, and p90RSK in INS-1 (832\/13) cells and isolated rat islets, all key mediators of cell survival and proliferation. Thus, we demonstrate that CART 55-102 protects beta cells against glucotoxicity and promotes proliferation. Taken together our data point to the potential use of CART in therapeutic interventions targeted at enhancing functional beta cell mass and long-term insulin secretion in T2D.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Sathanoori R","Olde B","Erlinge D","Goransson O","Wierup N"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m112.437145","first_seen_on":"2012-12-24T13:38:05+00:00","issns":["0021-9258","1083-351X"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1359844186,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23250745","http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/288\/5\/3208.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"23250745","pubdate":"2012-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Cocaine- and Amphetamine-regulated Transcript (CART) Protects Beta Cells against Glucotoxicity and Increases Cell Proliferation","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cocaine-amphetamineregulated-transcript-cart-protects-beta-cells-against-glucotoxicity-increases-cel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":1929484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2536701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283162,"mean":5.9298617535607,"rank":109786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":169452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283162,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30238,"mean":2.4954086714952,"rank":18053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":12091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30238,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1601,"mean":2.8886675,"rank":584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1601,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
