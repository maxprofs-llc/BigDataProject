The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) among antiretroviral (ARV)-naive HIV-infected pregnant women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ARV-naive pregnant women were recruited at Hospital Geral de Nova Iguacu (HGNI), Rio de Janeiro, from 2005 to 2008. HIV genotyping was carried out using ViroSeq (Abbott v. 2.0). TDRM were detected using the Calibrated Population Resistance Tool-CPR v. 6.0.The prevalence of mutations associated with resistance in the protease and reverse transcriptase regions of the HIV genome were assessed in samples collected prior to initiation of ARV prophylaxis or treatment. Among 238 eligible specimens that were collected, 197 samples were successfully amplified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Eighty-one percent of women were infected with HIV subtype B, 10% with subtype F1 viruses, 1.0% with subtype C virus, and 8.0% with recombinant forms of the virus. The prevalence of HIV TDRM was 5.6% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 2.0% for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and 3.0% for protease inhibitors. The overall prevalence of any drug resistance was 10.7%. There were no multiclass resistant strains identified in the analyzed samples. The prevalence of HIV TDRM among the pregnant women in our cohort was moderate. Resistance testing should be encouraged in Rio de Janeiro, among other locations, for all HIV-infected pregnant women prior to prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006922","authors":["Pilotto JH","Grinztejn B","Veloso VG","Velasque L","Friedman RK","Moreira RI","Rodrigues-Pedro A","Oliveira SM","Currier J","Morgado MG"],"doi":"10.1089\/aid.2011.0333","first_seen_on":"2012-12-30T09:45:24+00:00","issns":["0889-2229"],"issue":"","journal":"AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses","last_mentioned_on":1358545249,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23259924"],"pmid":"23259924","pubdate":"2012-12-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Moderate prevalence of transmitted drug-resistance mutations among antiretroviral-na\u00efve HIV-infected pregnant women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/moderate-prevalence-transmitted-drug-resistance-mutations-among-antiretroviralnaive-hivinfected-preg"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211872,"mean":6.3514955583614,"rank":6218923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211872,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291705,"mean":6.5266566108109,"rank":243240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291705,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":747,"mean":3.0140670241287,"rank":624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":747,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.6657894736842,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
