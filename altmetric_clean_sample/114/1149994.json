We analyzed 19,007 collisions between a bicycle and another vehicle in which only one of the drivers committed an infraction, and 13,540 records that included the group of non-infractor cyclists in the above collisions plus cyclists involved in single-bicycle crashes. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated for being responsible for each type of crash for each factor considered. Age from 10 to 19 years, male sex, alcohol or drug consumption and non-helmet use were cyclist-related variables associated with a higher risk of crash, whereas cycling more than 1h increased only the risk of single crashes. Bicycles with brake defects and ridden by two occupants were also at higher risk of involvement in a crash, whereas light defects were associated only with collisions with another vehicle. For drivers of the other vehicle, age more than 60 years, alcohol, not using safety devices and nonprofessional drivers were at higher risk. The risk of colliding with a bicycle was higher for mopeds than for passenger cars.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213e","authors":["Mart\u00ednez-Ruiz V","Lardelli-Claret P","Jim\u00e9nez-Mej\u00edas E","Amezcua-Prieto C","Jim\u00e9nez-Mole\u00f3n JJ","Luna Del Castillo JD"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aap.2012.11.023","first_seen_on":"2013-01-01T23:22:18+00:00","issns":["1879-2057","0001-4575","00014575"],"journal":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1457648206,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23274281?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23274281"],"pmid":"23274281","pubdate":"2012-12-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Transportation And Freight Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Risk factors for causing road crashes involving cyclists: An application of a quasi-induced exposure method.","type":"article","volume":"51C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-causing-road-crashes-involving-cyclists-application-quasiinduced-exposure-method"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377337,"mean":6.4097701099652,"rank":3246672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4058505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377337,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292742,"mean":6.5467007286304,"rank":116473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":171910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292742,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2316,"mean":5.0447853131749,"rank":1190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2316,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":3.6600353982301,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
