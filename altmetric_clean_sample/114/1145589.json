Emerging evidence for labor division indicates that manipulation of these cells could bear therapeutic potential. However, specific ontogenies of individual populations and the overall functional organization of this cellular network are not well defined. Here we report a fate-mapping study of\u00a0the\u00a0murine monocyte and macrophage compartment taking advantage of constitutive and conditional CX(3)CR1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase expression. We have demonstrated that major tissue-resident macrophage populations, including liver Kupffer cells and lung alveolar, splenic, and peritoneal macrophages, are established prior to birth and maintain themselves subsequently during adulthood independent of replenishment by blood monocytes. Furthermore, we have established that short-lived Ly6C(+) monocytes constitute obligatory steady-state precursors of blood-resident Ly6C(-) cells and that the abundance of Ly6C(+) blood monocytes dynamically controls the circulation lifespan of their progeny.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a95","authors":["Steffen Jung","Yona S","Kim KW","Wolf Y","Mildner A","Varol D","Breker M","Strauss-Ayali D","Viukov S","Guilliams M","Misharin A","Hume DA","Perlman H","Malissen B","Zelzer E","Jung S","Simon Yona","Ki-Wook Kim","Yochai Wolf","Alexander Mildner","Diana Varol","Michal Breker","Dalit Strauss-Ayali","Sergey Viukov","Martin Guilliams","Alexander Misharin","David\u00a0A.
