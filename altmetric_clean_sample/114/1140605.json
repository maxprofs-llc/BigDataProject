Thirty-six females (X age = 35.7 yr) and 41 males (X age = 36.1 yr) were randomly assigned to RUN-CWT, CWT, and control groups. The training groups participated in 12-wk programs, 3 d . wk-1. Three circuits of 10 weight-training exercises were completed with 12-15 repetitions performed in 30 s at 40% of one-repetition maximum at each station. The 30-min RUN-CWT program included 30 s of running on an indoor track following each CWT station, whereas the 22.5 min CWT program included a 15-s rest period between stations. The RUN-CWT groups had a significant (+ 17%) increase in VO2max (females 30.5-35.7 ml . kg-1 . min-1 and males 39.7-46.3 ml . kg-1 . min-1) and strength (females + 24% and males +21%), and a significant decrease in body fat percentage (females -3.2% and males -4.1%). The CWT groups also increased significantly in VO2max (+12%) and strength (+17%) and decreased in body fat (-3.0%). The controls did not change significantly in any variable. Statistically, one training program was not shown to be superior to the other; thus, both programs of RUN-CWT and CWT were effective in improving measures of physical fitness.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5033cf058f61000309f","first_seen_on":"2012-12-23T23:22:02+00:00","issns":["0195-9131"],"issue":"3","journal":"Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise","last_mentioned_on":1378820880,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7109892"],"pmid":"7109892","pubdate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"A comparison of combined running and weight training with circuit weight training.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highintensity-circuit-training-using-body-weight-maximum-results-minimal-investment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629536,"mean":4.93415564694,"rank":1808088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1644652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629536,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278440,"mean":5.7247267516404,"rank":126921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":132704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278440,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2285,"mean":12.740100700525,"rank":1647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2285,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":23.597974683544,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
