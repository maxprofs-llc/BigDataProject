In this Feature Article we review recent work, from our own laboratory and elsewhere, on the synthesis, properties and applications of functional LDH films, and also offer some perspectives for the design of future multifunctional LDH films.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Xiaoxiao Guo","Fazhi Zhang","David G.
