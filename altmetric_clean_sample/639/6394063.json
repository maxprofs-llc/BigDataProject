Single-crystal X-ray structure analysis showed that ZJNU-80 adopts the same topology as the parent compound NOTT-101, and the tethering groups take part in the window partition, not the cage partition. The gas adsorption studies showed that, despite the lower porosity, ZJNU-80a exhibits low-pressure gas adsorption behavior similar to that of the parent MOF NOTT-101a toward CO2, CH4, and N2 at ambient temperature because of the fact that the window partition as a result of chemical cross-linking does not almost alter the pore-size distributions. However, different adsorption behaviors toward 1-butene, a molecule with even larger kinetic diameter than that of the aforementioned adsorbates, were observed because the window partition alters the efficiency with which 1-butene molecules pack within ZJNU-80a and NOTT-101a at conditions close to saturation. This work provides a fundamental understanding on the effect of chemical cross-linking on the MOF's structure and gas adsorption properties.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Jingjing Jiao"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00253","first_seen_on":"2016-03-30T20:53:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1459377787,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00253?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:%20acs\/inocaj%20(Inorganic%20Chemistry)&hootPostID=5065144a1cceb7f7744ef0db5008eae1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00253?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b00253"],"pmid":"27028804","pubdate":"2016-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A Chemically Cross-Linked NbO-Type Metal\u2013Organic Framework: Cage or Window Partition?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemically-crosslinked-nbotype-metalorganic-framework-cage-window-partition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7465518,"mean":6.4808427461848,"rank":3842707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2090442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7465518,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273100,"mean":11.062911493634,"rank":148442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273100,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8624,"mean":1.1076973211179,"rank":2387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":5565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8624,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":373,"mean":0.93615591397849,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":373,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
