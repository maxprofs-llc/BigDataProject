We report a 62 year old patient who developed psychiatric disorders followed by epilepsy, movement disorders, mutism and hypoventilation. Flair weighted brain MRI sequences showed diffuse high signals in the limbic system. Anti-NMDAR antibodies were detected in the serum and CSF. The patient's IgGs reacted with the patient's own tumor cells and with 2 out of 4 small cell lung cancers of patients without neurological syndrome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255c","authors":["Jeraiby, M","Depinc\u00e9-Berger, A","Bossy, V","Antoine, J C","Paul, S","M.
