Xanthoparmelia mexicana (Gyeln.) Hale, highly abundant lichen in this region, was exposed during 6\u00a0months and then the samples were collected together with the wall dust; both materials were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total PAH concentrations in dust and in lichen samples were in the range 1392-7961\u00a0ng\u00a0g(-1) (average per tunnel 4637\u00a0ng\u00a0g(-1)) and 522-3571\u00a0ng\u00a0g(-1) (average 2587\u00a0ng\u00a0g(-1)), respectively. In dust, the highest concentrations corresponded to PYR, FLA, BaA, CHR, BaP, and PHE, whereas in lichens the most abundant were DahA, IcdP, BghiP, and PYR. The obtained results suggested passive deposition of PAHs on lipophilic lichen surface rather than phenomena associated with metabolic activity of the exposed organisms. Application of seven different molecular diagnostic ratios pointed to gasoline-operated cars as the principal source of PAHs. Based on the obtained results and their comparison with data reported for other geographical regions, Guanajuato tunnels were considered moderately contaminated with PAHs; however toxic BaP equivalent concentrations integrated for seven carcinogenic compounds presented relatively high values in four tunnels: 567-1051\u00a0ngBaPeq\u2009g(-1) as evaluated for dust samples. Since up to 7000 persons walk daily through tunnels, the obtained data call for more detailed study evaluating PAHs toxicity in Guanajuato population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Puy-Alquiza","Veridiana Reyes","Katarzyna Wrobel","Kazimierz Wrobel","Julio C\u00e9sar Torres Elguera","Ra\u00fal Miranda-Aviles"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11356-016-6256-6","first_seen_on":"2016-03-30T18:38:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1614-7499"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Pollution Research","last_mentioned_on":1459348292,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11356-016-6256-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11356-016-6256-6.pdf","pmid":"26961526","pubdate":"2016-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in urban tunnels of Guanajuato city (Mexico) measured in deposited dust particles and in transplanted lichen Xanthoparmelia mexicana (Gyeln.)
