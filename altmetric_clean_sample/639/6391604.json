Keeping this fact into consideration, we investigated role of Rv3203, a cell wall associated protein with lipolytic activity, in imparting protection against experimental murine tuberculosis. The data of the present study suggested that archaeosome encapsulated Rv3203 induce strong lymphocyte proliferation, up-regulated Th-1 biased cytokines profile, increased expression of co-stimulatory markers on both antigen presenting cells and T lymphocytes. The immuno-prophylactic response was further modulated by exposure of the animals to zymosan, a TLR2\/6 agonist, prior to immunization with archaeosome encapsulated Rv3203. Interestingly, pre-treatment of experimental animals with zymosan boosted strong immunological memory as compared to archaeosome encapsulated Rv3203 as well as BCG vaccine. We conclude that priming of immunized animal with TLR agonist followed by immunization with archaeosomes encapsulated Rv3203 offer substantial protection against tuberculosis infection and could be a potential subunit vaccine based prophylactic strategy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Mohammad, Owais","Kaur, Jagdeep","Singh, Gurpreet","Faisal, Syed Mohd","Azhar, Asim","Rauf, Mohd Ahmar","Gupta, Umesh Dutt","Gupta, Pushpa","Pal, Rahul","Zubair, Swaleha"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0152240","first_seen_on":"2016-03-30T19:05:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1472625489,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27023750?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27023750","pubdate":"2016-03-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0152240","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"TLR Agonist Augments Prophylactic Potential of Acid Inducible Antigen Rv3203 against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in Experimental Animals","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tlr-agonist-augments-prophylactic-potential-acid-inducible-antigen-rv3203-against-mycobacterium-tube"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":7183442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279408,"mean":11.303512624952,"rank":236737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279408,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114955,"mean":10.602214172626,"rank":96948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114955,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5274,"mean":12.943187179973,"rank":4669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5274,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
