Molecular analysis of isolates included emm, multilocus-sequence typing, and superantigen profile determination.\nForty episodes were detected (annual incidence 1.1 x 100,000 inhabitants, range 0.29-2.29). Thirty-seven episodes were community-acquired, 21 involved an invasive infection and 10 developed STSS. The associated mortality rate was 20%, with half of the patients dying within 24 hours after admission. Influenza coinfection was confirmed in four patients and suspected in another. The 52.5% of episodes occurred outside the influenza seasonal epidemic. The 67.5% of affected persons were elderly individuals and adults with severe comorbidities, although 13 patients had no comorbidities, 2 of them had a fatal outcome. Eleven clones were identified, the most prevalent being emm1\/ST28 (43.6%) causing the most severe cases.\nS. pyogenes pneumonia had a continuous presence frequently unrelated to influenza infection, being rapidly fatal even in previously healthy individuals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Esther Tamayo","Milagrosa Montes","Diego Vicente","Emilio P\u00e9rez-Trallero"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0152640","first_seen_on":"2016-03-30T21:43:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1459416848,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0152640","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0152640"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0152640.PDF","pmid":"27027618","pubdate":"2016-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0152640","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":" Streptococcus pyogenes Pneumonia in Adults: Clinical Presentation and Molecular Characterization of Isolates 2006-2015","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/streptococcus-pyogenes-pneumonia-adults-clinical-presentation-molecular-characterization-isolates-20-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7471181,"mean":6.4836306053357,"rank":5391281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1817474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7471181,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273142,"mean":11.06469523799,"rank":176450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":81170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273142,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106832,"mean":10.186959328285,"rank":72861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":28811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106832,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5255,"mean":12.559345641416,"rank":3840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":1142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5255,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
