Expert opinions reported relational benefits and tranquilizing effects of therapeutic body wraps (TBWs). Yet this adjunct nursing therapy has rarely been studied and the existing knowledge is limited to single clinical cases reported from clinicians' perspectives. This study reports on seven adult patients, whose independent accounts of TBWs were audio-recorded, transcribed and cross-analyzed. It sheds light on a commonly underestimated need among many severely ill psychiatric patients to have their anxiety addressed on a bodily level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005738","authors":["Julie Dubois","Gilles Bangerter","Krzysztof Skuza"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.apnu.2017.04.005","first_seen_on":"2017-04-27T09:47:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["08839417","1532-8228"],"issue":"4","journal":"Archives of Psychiatric Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1499514794,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http:\/\/www.psychiatricnursing.org\/article\/S0883-9417(17)30081-X\/fulltext?rss=yes&code=yapnu-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/authShare\/S088394171730081X\/20170708T051800Z\/1?md5=ad030f8e0e9d1988d1437013f2343552","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S088394171730081X&_version=1&md5=461b129e3bd5876d9e4beaffbb7dd2da"],"pmid":"28693871","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","psychiatry"],"title":"\u201cIt's the First Time I Feel as One\u201d.
