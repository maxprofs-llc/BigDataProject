Porcine disc histology and Chinese hamster ovary GAG ozonolysis results showed that administered ozone reacted with and fragmented disc proteoglycans, reducing disc volume through disc dehydration. Cytokine analysis of porcine discs found that each of 4 cytokines measured (interleukin [IL]-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1) increased in concentration after 2 wt% ozone treatment.\nOxygen-ozone therapy breaks down proteoglycan GAGs that maintain disc osmotic pressure, dehydrating the nucleus pulposus and reducing intervertebral disc volume. This is likely a primary mechanism by which ozone relieves nerve root compression and alleviates herniated disc-related pain. Additionally, 2 wt% ozone appears to interact with intradiscal cytokines, generating an antiinflammatory response that may contribute to symptom improvement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f16","authors":["Kieran Murphy","Gavin Elias","Jim Steppan","Chett Boxley","Kuberan Balagurunathan","Xylophone Victor","Thomas Meaders","Mario Muto","Murphy, Kieran","Elias, Gavin","Steppan, Jim","Boxley, Chett","Balagurunathan, Kuberan","Victor, Xylophone","Meaders, Thomas","Muto, Mario"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvir.2016.04.012","endpage":"1250.e3","first_seen_on":"2016-06-28T04:11:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-7732","10510443"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1470059886,"links":["http:\/\/www.jvir.org\/article\/S1051-0443(16)30046-X\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27363296","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.jvir.org\/article\/S1051-0443(16)30046-X\/abstract?elsca1%3Detoc%26amp;elsca2%3Demail%26amp;elsca3%3D1051-0443_201608_27_8_%26amp;elsca4%3DVascular%2520Surgery%257CRadiology\/Imaging&rc=0&code=jvir-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jvir.org\/article\/S105104431630046X\/pdf","pmid":"27363296","pubdate":"2016-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1242","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Percutaneous Treatment of Herniated Lumbar Discs with Ozone: Investigation of the Mechanisms of Action","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/percutaneous-treatment-herniated-lumbar-discs-ozone-investigation-mechanisms-action"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":3721719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4347079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262656,"mean":11.668846547752,"rank":113011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":145171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262656,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1271,"mean":5.6237244094488,"rank":772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1271,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":6.4239130434783,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
