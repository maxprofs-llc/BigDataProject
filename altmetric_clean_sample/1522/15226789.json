Yet it has been criticised by some sociologists, in part because it seems too negative about medicine, and modified or replaced by others with concepts deemed more relevant like biomedicalisation and pharmaceuticalisation. My aim in this paper is to reassess the concept and consider whether it still has value in exploring significant aspects of the role of medicine in present-day society. I start with an archaeology of the concept's development and the different ways it has been used. This covers some familiar ground but is essential to the main task: examining criticisms of the concept and assessing its value. I conclude that the concept continues to have a crucial and productive place in sociological analyses of medicine and that the process of medicalisation is still a key feature of late-modern social life and culture.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003571","authors":["Busfield, Joan"],"doi":"10.1111\/1467-9566.12538","first_seen_on":"2017-01-04T12:47:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1467-9566","01419889"],"journal":"Sociology of Health & Illness","last_mentioned_on":1498929960,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1467-9566.12538\/abstract;jsessionid=31E12DDC947CDB465F43FF678396E5DF.f01t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1467-9566.12538\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1467-9566.12538\/abstract;jsessionid=17C32FC97FD457D9D4B824821A0D4723.f03t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1467-9566.12538#.WHiAw2u8eDc.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2F1467-9566.12538#.WHib1hmWy90.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1467-9566.12538\/abstract;jsessionid=11EA5A986FECE399B0B3985E1334C206.f04t03?systemMessage=WOL+Usage+report+download+page+will+be+unavailable+on+Friday+27th+January+2017+at+23%3A00+GMT%2F+18%3A00+EST%2F+07%3A00+SGT+%28Saturday+28th+Jan+for+SGT%29++for+up+to+2+hours+due+to+essential+server+maintenance.+Apologies+for+the+inconvenience"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1467-9566.12538\/pdf","pmid":"28052343","pubdate":"2017-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"The concept of medicalisation reassessed","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/1467-9566.12538","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/concept-medicalisation-reassessed"},"altmetric_score":{"score":30.26,"score_history":{"1y":30.26,"6m":8.08,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":30.26},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":305840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":8145425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280633,"mean":12.294088792439,"rank":18200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":262433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280633,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1025,"mean":8.239826171875,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1025,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":10.835555555556,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"researcher":11,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":11,"Members of the public":12,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
