Light microscopy has historically been a central method in correlative microscopy due to its widespread availability, compatibility with hydrated and live biological samples, and excellent molecular specificity through fluorescence labeling. However, conventional light microscopy can only achieve a resolution of \u223c300 nm, undercutting its advantages in correlations with higher-resolution methods. The rise of super-resolution microscopy (SRM) over the past decade has drastically improved the resolution of light microscopy to \u223c10 nm, thus creating exciting new opportunities and challenges for correlative microscopy. Here we review how these challenges are addressed to effectively correlate SRM with other microscopy techniques, including light microscopy, electron microscopy, cryomicroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and various forms of spectroscopy. Though we emphasize biological studies, we also discuss the application of correlative SRM to materials characterization and single-molecule reactions. Finally, we point out current limitations and discuss possible future improvements and advances. We thus demonstrate how a correlative approach adds new dimensions of information and provides new opportunities in the fast-growing field of SRM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ed","authors":["Meghan Hauser"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.chemrev.6b00604","first_seen_on":"2017-01-04T09:44:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0009-2665","1520-6890"],"journal":"Chemical Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1484167196,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/full\/10.1021\/acs.chemrev.6b00604","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1021\/acs.chemrev.6b00604"],"pmid":"28045508","pubdate":"2017-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Correlative Super-Resolution Microscopy: New Dimensions and New Opportunities","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlative-superresolution-microscopy-new-dimensions-new-opportunities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.2,"score_history":{"1y":11.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":720383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7336463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255865,"mean":12.659364576494,"rank":36533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":219254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255865,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1934,"mean":3.9147646145887,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1934,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":4.0102941176471,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":11}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
