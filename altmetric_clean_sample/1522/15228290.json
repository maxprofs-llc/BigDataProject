Usual methods for determining the whole body surface area (WBSA) are based on well known formulae, characterized by large errors when the subject is obese, or belongs to certain subgroups. For these situations, we believe that a computer vision approach can overcome these problems and provide a better estimate of this important body indicator. Unfortunately, using machine learning techniques to design a computer vision system able to provide a new body indicator that goes beyond the use of only body weight and height, entails a long and expensive data acquisition process. A more viable solution is to use a dataset composed of virtual subjects. Generating a virtual dataset allowed us to build a population with different characteristics (obese, underweight, age, gender). However, synthetic data might differ from a real scenario, typical of the physician's clinic. For this reason we develop a new virtual environment to facilitate the analysis of human subjects in 3D. This framework can simulate the acquisition process of a real camera, making it easy to analyze and to create training data for machine learning algorithms. With this virtual environment, we can easily simulate the real setup of a clinic, where a subject is standing in front of a camera, or may assume a different pose with respect to the camera. We use this newly designated environment to analyze the whole body surface area (WBSA). In particular, we show that we can obtain accurate WBSA estimations with just one view, virtually enabling the possibility to use inexpensive depth sensors (e.g., the Kinect) for large scale quantification of the WBSA from a single view 3D map.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Marco Piccirilli","Gianfranco Doretto","Donald Adjeroh"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0166749","first_seen_on":"2017-01-04T14:18:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1483539494,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0166749"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0166749&type=printable","pmid":"28045895","pubdate":"2017-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0166749","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A Framework for Analyzing the Whole Body Surface Area from a Single View","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/framework-analyzing-whole-body-surface-area-single-view"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7981790,"mean":6.7349664530035,"rank":6905258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7981790,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253621,"mean":12.598369686933,"rank":208940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253621,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112077,"mean":10.349626342839,"rank":94430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112077,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3931,"mean":12.499838676845,"rank":3093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3931,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
