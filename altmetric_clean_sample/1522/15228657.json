The chemical profile of the latex of Euphorbia peplus was investigated. A total of 13 terpenoids including two previously unknown diterpenoids, (2S*,3S*,4R*,5R*,6R*,8R*,l1R*,13S*,14S*,15R*, 16R*)-5,8,15-triacetoxy-3-benzoyloxy-11,16-dihydroxy-9-oxopepluane and (2R*,3R*, 4S*,5R*,7S*,8S*,9S*,l3S*,14S*,15R*)-2,5,8,9,14-pentaacetoxy-3-benzoyloxy-15-hydroxy-7-isobutyroyloxyjatropha-6(17),11E-diene), ten known diterpenoids, and a known acyclic triterpene alcohol peplusol, were identified, using HPLC and UPLC-MS\/MS analyses and through comparison with the authentic compounds isolated from the whole plant. The diterpenoids exhibited significant antifeedant activity against a generalist plant-feeding insect, the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), with EC50 values ranging from 0.36 to 4.60\u00a0\u03bcg\/cm(2). In particular, (2R*,3R*,4S*,5R*,7S*,8S*,9S*,l3S*,14S*,15R*)-2,5,9,14-tetraacetoxy-3-benzoyloxy-8,15-dihydroxy-7-isobutyroyloxyjatropha-6(17),11E-diene and (2R*,3R*, 4S*,5R*,7S*,8S*,9S*,l3S*,14S*,15R*)-2,5,14-triacetoxy-3-benzoyloxy-8,15-dihydroxy-7-isobutyroyloxy-9-nicotinoyloxyjatropha-6(17),11E-diene had EC50 values of 0.36 and 0.43\u00a0\u03bcg\/cm(2), respectively, which were approximately 7-fold more potent than commercial neem oil (EC50\u00a0=\u00a02.62\u00a0\u03bcg\/cm(2)). In addition, the major peplusol showed obvious antifungal activity against three strains of agricultural phytopathogenic fungi, Rhizoctonia solani, Colletotrichum litchi and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum. The results indicated that terpenoids in the latex of E. peplus are rich and highly diversified, and might function as constitutive defense metabolites against insect herbivores and pathogens for the plant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003327","authors":["Hua, Juan","Liu, Yan","Xiao, Chao-Jiang","Jing, Shu-Xi","Luo, Shi-Hong","Li, Sheng-Hong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.phytochem.2016.12.021","first_seen_on":"2017-01-04T14:43:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00319422","1873-3700"],"journal":"Phytochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1483554736,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0031942216303065"],"pmid":"28062071","pubdate":"2017-01-08T22:03:47+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","botany"],"title":"Chemical profile and defensive function of the latex of Euphorbia peplus","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemical-profile-defensive-function-latex-euphorbia-peplus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7981790,"mean":6.7349664530035,"rank":3189871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4734805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7981790,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253621,"mean":12.598353915306,"rank":98475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":153366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253621,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1524,"mean":3.0325712409718,"rank":998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1524,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.9878571428571,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1,"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"IN":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemEcolHerb\/statuses\/816656323353964546","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15228657],"posted_on":"2017-01-04T14:43:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Insect Herbivory","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/614384242206875648\/d3vaRiHZ_normal.jpg","description":"Scientific Papers on Herbivory including Arthropod-Plant Interactions, Chemical Ecology,Entomology, Chemosensation, Insect Sequestration & Insecticide Tolerance","id_on_source":"ChemEcolHerb","tweeter_id":"3290942087","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":75},"tweet_id":"816656323353964546"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Toby_Bruce\/statuses\/816699051651502080","license":"gnip","rt":["ChemEcolHerb"],"citation_ids":[15228657],"posted_on":"2017-01-04T17:33:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Toby Bruce","url":"https:\/\/www.keele.ac.uk\/lifesci\/people\/tobybruce\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/833414912709894144\/enUHfBtG_normal.jpg","description":"Professor of Insect Chemical Ecology @KeeleUniversity Leading research on insect interactions with crops & other insects.
