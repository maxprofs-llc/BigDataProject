Residue Val68, which is in van der Waals contact with the heme in Mb, has been replaced by Glu, Asp, and Asn. The changes in E degrees' and the standard entropy (delta S degrees') and enthalpy (delta H degrees') of reduction in the mutant proteins were determined relative to values for wild type; the change in E degrees' at 25 degrees C was about -200 millivolts for the Glu and Asp mutants, and about -80 millivolts for the Asn mutant. At pH 7.0, reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) in the Glu and Asp mutants is accompanied by uptake of a proton by the protein. These studies demonstrate that Mb can tolerate substitution of a buried hydrophobic group by potentially charged and polar residues and that such amino acid replacements can lead to substantial changes in the redox thermodynamics of the protein.","ads_id":"1989Sci...243...69V","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["R Varadarajan","TE Zewert","HB Gray","SG Boxer"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.2563171","endpage":"72","first_seen_on":"2017-01-04T06:35:45+00:00","issns":["0036-8075","1095-9203"],"issue":"4887","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1483511739,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.2563171"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/sci\/243\/4887\/69.full.pdf","pmid":"2563171","pubdate":"1989-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"69","subjects":["science"],"title":"Effects of buried ionizable amino acids on the reduction potential of recombinant myoglobin","type":"article","volume":"243","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-buried-ionizable-amino-acids-reduction-potential-recombinant-myoglobin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7981790,"mean":6.7349664530035,"rank":1973697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4915224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7981790,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253622,"mean":12.598357470398,"rank":87332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":161666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253622,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40588,"mean":32.14508951142,"rank":22804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":9644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40588,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":925,"mean":74.702491341992,"rank":548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":925,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
