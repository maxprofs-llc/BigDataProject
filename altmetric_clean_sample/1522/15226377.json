The current study reports toxicities of a protocol of metronomic cyclophosphamide, and identifies risk factors for development of adverse effects. A retrospective cohort study of dogs treated with metronomic cyclophosphamide at an intended dose of 25 mg\/m(2) every other day was conducted. Fifty dogs were included with a median length of treatment of 90 days (range: 1 to 1305 days). Treatment was discontinued in 22 dogs (44%) due to adverse effects; 16 dogs (32%) developed SHC after a median time of 127.5 days (range: 54 to 1305 days). Higher cumulative dose was significantly associated with a higher risk of SHC development (P = 0.048). Therefore, close monitoring and\/or prophylactic treatments should be considered for patients receiving chronic metronomic cyclophosphamide therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dc5","authors":["Matsuyama, Arata","Woods, J Paul","Mutsaers, Anthony J"],"first_seen_on":"2017-01-04T12:11:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0008-5286"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Canadian Veterinary Journal","last_mentioned_on":1483599804,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28042155\/"],"pmcid":"PMC5157738","pmid":"28042155","pubdate":"2017-01-04T22:17:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Evaluation of toxicity of a chronic alternate day metronomic cyclophosphamide chemotherapy protocol in dogs with naturally occurring cancer.","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-toxicity-chronic-alternate-day-metronomic-cyclophosphamide-chemotherapy-protocol-dogs-nat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":3688825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4266918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253902,"mean":12.59213188605,"rank":120308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":131843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253902,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":673,"mean":2.2047232142857,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":673,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.32142857142857,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet\/statuses\/816617882570330112","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15226377],"posted_on":"2017-01-04T12:10:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Oncologiavet","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/849456038709538817\/jJ9c5Y2Q_normal.jpg","description":"Francisco Alvarez Berger DVM MSc DACVIM (Oncology) - Veterinary oncology","id_on_source":"oncologiavet","tweeter_id":"167392151","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":4488},"tweet_id":"816617882570330112"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet\/statuses\/816619196490641408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15226377],"posted_on":"2017-01-04T12:16:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Oncologiavet","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/849456038709538817\/jJ9c5Y2Q_normal.jpg","description":"Francisco Alvarez Berger DVM MSc DACVIM (Oncology) - Veterinary oncology","id_on_source":"oncologiavet","tweeter_id":"167392151","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":4488},"tweet_id":"816619196490641408"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eldublines\/statuses\/816652694307872768","license":"gnip","rt":["oncologiavet"],"citation_ids":[15226377],"posted_on":"2017-01-04T14:29:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Juan Carlos Pinto","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1426605150\/Rene-Magritte-Golconda_normal.jpg","description":"Lo admirable es que el hombre siga luchando y creando belleza en medio de un mundo b\u00e1rbaro y hostil .
