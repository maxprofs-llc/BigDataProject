Dementia severity was measured semiannually with the Bedford Alzheimer Nursing Severity-Scale (BANS-S).\nThe median BANS-S score at baseline was 13 (range, 7 to 28). Pneumonia occurred in 103 (28%) and intake problems in 126 (34%) of 367 residents with complete registration of pneumonia and intake problems. Compared with dementia severity, incident pneumonia and, even more so, incident intake problems were more strongly associated with mortality risk. Pneumonia and intake problems both mediated the relationship between more severe dementia and mortality.\nDeveloping pneumonia and intake problems affects survival, and this is not limited to advanced dementia. The occurrence of pneumonia and intake problems are important signals to consider a palliative care approach in nursing home residents with dementia, and an active focus on advance care planning is needed. Future studies should investigate whether this is also relevant for patients in primary care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6083cf058f61000695b","authors":["Hendriks, Simone A","Smalbrugge, Martin","van
