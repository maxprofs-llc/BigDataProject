However, the limited understanding of drug exposure in this species hampers its implementation in translational research. Using paracetamol as a paradigm compound, we present a novel method to characterize pharmacokinetic processes in zebrafish larvae, by combining sensitive bioanalytical methods and nonlinear mixed effects modeling. The developed method allowed quantification of paracetamol and its two major metabolites, paracetamol-sulfate and paracetamol-glucuronide in pooled samples of five lysed zebrafish larvae of 3 days post-fertilization. Paracetamol drug uptake was quantified to be 0.289\u2009pmole\/min and paracetamol clearance was quantified to be 1.7% of the total value of the larvae. With an average volume determined to be 0.290\u2009\u03bcL, this yields an absolute clearance of 2.96\u2009\u00d7\u200910(7) L\/h, which scales reasonably well with clearance rates in higher vertebrates. The developed methodology will improve the success rate of drug screens in zebrafish larvae and the translation potential of findings, by allowing the establishment of accurate exposure profiles and thereby also the establishment of concentration-effect relationships.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d45","authors":["KantaeVasudev","KrekelsElke H.J.","OrdasAnita","Gonz\u00e1lezOskar","van WijkRob C.","HarmsAmy C.","RaczPeter I.","van der GraafPiet H.","SpainkHerman P.","HankemeierThomas"],"doi":"10.1089\/zeb.2016.1313","first_seen_on":"2017-02-22T15:23:46+00:00","issns":["1545-8547","1557-8542"],"journal":"Zebrafish","last_mentioned_on":1497532474,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/10.1089\/zeb.2016.1313","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/zeb.2016.1313"],"pmid":"27632065","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Paracetamol Uptake and Clearance in Zebrafish Larvae: Expanding the Allometric Scale in Vertebrates with Five Orders of Magnitude","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacokinetic-modeling-paracetamol-uptake-clearance-zebrafish-larvae-expanding-allometric-scale-ve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.024,"score_history":{"1y":11.024,"6m":4,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.024},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":782761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7589852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245224,"mean":13.728122631237,"rank":38352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":206872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245224,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":2.7271098901099,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
