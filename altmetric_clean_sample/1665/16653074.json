Prior to injection into mice, all samples were washed by a procedure that is described and was shown not to reduce infectivity titres. Although the infectivity titre of the sample that was autoclaved in SDS was reduced considerably, infectivity was present in all of the samples exposed to cold or hot SDS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fb","authors":["D.M Taylor","K Fernie","I McConnell","P.J Steele"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0378-1135(99)00026-7","first_seen_on":"2017-02-22T15:27:28+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["03781135","0378-1135"],"issue":"1","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1009843200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0378-1135(99)00026-7"],"pmid":"10392773","pubdate":"1999-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Survival of scrapie agent after exposure to sodium dodecyl sulphate and heat","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0378113599000267","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survival-scrapie-agent-after-exposure-sodium-dodecyl-sulphate-heat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7246563,"mean":6.3631476457354,"rank":1723151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4600016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7246563,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89858,"mean":12.68895286956,"rank":29192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":58909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89858,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1278,"mean":2.0788457321848,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1278,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":3.2970588235294,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
