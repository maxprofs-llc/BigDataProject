No difference in duration of postoperative #shivering with pre-warming in dogs after #ovariohysterectomy"],"citation":{"abstract":"This study compared perianesthetic body temperatures and times to recovery from general anesthesia in small dogs that were either warmed for 20 minutes prior to anesthesia or not warmed. Twenty-eight client-owned dogs that were presented for ovariohysterectomy were included in the study. Small (<10 kg body weight) dogs with normal circulatory status were randomly assigned to receive pre-warming for 20 minutes or no treatment. Body temperature was measured during the procedure using a calibrated rectal probe. Duration of anesthesia and surgery, time to rescue warming, time to extubation, presence and duration of shivering, and time to return to normal temperature were recorded. Temperature at the end of surgery was significantly higher in the control group than the pre-warmed group. There was no difference in time to extubation or duration of postoperative shivering between groups. Pre-warming did not result in improved temperature or recovery from anesthesia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dc5","authors":["Aarnes, Turi K","Bednarski, Richard M","Lerche, Phillip","Hubbell, John A E"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-22T13:32:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0008-5286"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Canadian Veterinary Journal","last_mentioned_on":1487770295,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28216687"],"pmid":"28216687","pubdate":"2017-02-22T22:15:37+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Effect of pre-warming on perioperative hypothermia and anesthetic recovery in small breed dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy.","type":"article","volume":"58"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":4360658,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3866298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242693,"mean":13.702932301023,"rank":138577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":102699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242693,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":692,"mean":2.2032185238784,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":692,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.575,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Havemanypaws\/statuses\/834395211992354822","license":"gnip","rt":["Albinovet"],"citation_ids":[16644636],"posted_on":"2017-02-22T13:31:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Jasmine","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/845221434410569728\/ViqRFkBR_normal.jpg","description":"Married love animals have cats and dogs  I am disabled","id_on_source":"Havemanypaws","tweeter_id":"290628865","geo":{"lt":43.66702,"ln":-71.4998,"country":"US"},"followers":522},"tweet_id":"834395211992354822"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/834395053921538050","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16644636],"posted_on":"2017-02-22T13:30:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2106},"tweet_id":"834395053921538050"}]}}
