However, thrombin activity detection is currently limited because of the lack of convenient fluorescent probes. We developed a label-free fluorescent method to assay thrombin activity on the basis of a designed peptide probe with a thrombin-cleavable peptide sequence and a cysteine terminus. The peptide probe can be conjugated to DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) through Ag-S bonding; as a result, the fluorescence of DNA-AgNCs was enhanced. As the DNA-AgNCs-peptide conjugate was adsorbed to graphene oxide (GO), the enhanced fluorescence of DNA-AgNCs was quenched. Once the peptide probe was cleaved by thrombin, the resulting release of the DNA-AgNCs from the surface of GO restored the enhanced fluorescence. Thrombin can be determined with a linear range of 0.0-50.0 nM with a detection limit of 1 nM. The thrombin-sensitive probe with a cysteine terminus may be developed into probes to detect other proteases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002247","authors":["Jingjing Feng","Caixia Zhuo","Xuejuan Ma","Shuangqin Li","Yaodong Zhang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6an00366d","endpage":"4487","first_seen_on":"2016-05-17T12:39:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1364-5528"],"issue":"14","journal":"Analyst","last_mentioned_on":1463488727,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/AN\/C6AN00366D?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:%20rss\/AN%20(RSC%20-%20Analyst%20latest%20articles)"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/an\/c6an00366d","pmid":"27187619","pubdate":"2016-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4481","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"A peptide with a cysteine terminus: Probe for label-free fluorescent detection of thrombin activity","type":"article","volume":"141","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peptide-cysteine-terminus-probe-labelfree-fluorescent-detection-thrombin-activity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711702,"mean":6.6147835493025,"rank":6670771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711702,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269245,"mean":11.541996300753,"rank":224749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269245,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2002,"mean":2.8908905547226,"rank":1615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2002,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170,"mean":2.0768875739645,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
