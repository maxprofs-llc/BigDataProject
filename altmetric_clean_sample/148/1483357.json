In the present study, suspensions of GA nanoparticles with the average particle size about 200 nm were prepared by a supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process. Comparative studies were undertaken using lipopolysaccardide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophages RAW 264.7 as in vitro inflammatory model. Several important inflammation mediators such as NO, PGE2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were examined. These markers were highly stimulated by LPS and were inhibited both by nano-GA and unprocessed GA in a dose-dependent manner, especially PGE2 and TNF-\u03b1. However nano-GA and unprocessed GA inhibited NO only at a high concentration. In general, we found that GA nanoparticle suspensions exhibited much better anti-inflammatory activities compared to unprocessed GA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["Yuangang Zu"," Wang"," Luo"," Fu"," Wang","Thomas Efferth"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s37788","first_seen_on":"2013-05-17T13:32:04+00:00","issns":["1176-9114"],"journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1365864459,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/glycyrrhizic-acid-nanoparticles-inhibit-lps-induced-inflammatory-media-peer-reviewed-article-IJN"],"pmcid":"PMC3629880","pmid":"23610519","pubdate":"2013-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Glycyrrhizic acid nanoparticles inhibit LPS-induced inflammatory mediators in 264.7 mouse macrophages compared with unprocessed glycyrrhizic acid","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glycyrrhizic-acid-nanoparticles-inhibit-lpsinduced-inflammatory-mediators-2647-mouse-macrophages-com"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":2900541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85832,"mean":6.9103951253045,"rank":67501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85832,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":869,"mean":2.2760668202765,"rank":734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":869,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":2.377,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
