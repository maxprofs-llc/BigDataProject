Aggression and self-injury may be associated symptoms of autism and can result in significant harm to those affected as well as marked distress for their families. The precise nature of the relationship between aggressive or self-injurious behavior (SIB) and autism remains unclear and as a result, these symptoms are treated with a broad range of pharmacological approaches. This review seeks to systematically and critically examine the evidence for the pharmacological management of aggression and SIB in children with autism spectrum disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf1","authors":["Parikh MS","Kolevzon A","Hollander E"],"doi":"10.1089\/cap.2007.0041","first_seen_on":"2013-05-17T16:26:47+00:00","issns":["1044-5463"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Child & Adolescent Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1299066000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18439113","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/cap.2007.0041"],"pmid":"18439113","pubdate":"2008-04-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","pediatrics"],"title":"Psychopharmacology of aggression in children and adolescents with autism: a critical review of efficacy and tolerability.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychopharmacology-aggression-children-adolescents-autism-critical-review-efficacy-tolerability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.44,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.44},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4327521,"mean":4.9494520665238,"rank":657394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3669015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4327521,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88883,"mean":6.8223564726267,"rank":16700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":72170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88883,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":340,"mean":5.98201179941,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":340,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.1347058823529,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
