Now, as critical care ultrasound explodes around the world, it is important to realize the path its development has taken and learn from trials and tribulations of early practitioners in the field. The development and battles for the right to use ultrasound at the patient's bedside for >20 yrs is described in relation to its emergency medicine and surgical origins. Approaches to education, scanning, documentation, and organization at the national and regional levels are described.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000263f","authors":["Kendall JL","Hoffenberg SR","Smith RS"],"doi":"10.1097\/01.ccm.0000260623.38982.83","first_seen_on":"2013-05-18T02:20:22+00:00","issns":["0090-3493"],"issue":"5 Suppl","journal":"Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1337180010,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17446770"],"pmid":"17446770","pubdate":"2007-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"History of emergency and critical care ultrasound: the evolution of a new imaging paradigm.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/history-emergency-critical-care-ultrasound-evolution-new-imaging-paradigm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.736,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.736},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3684317,"mean":4.9202481350715,"rank":473543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3211107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3684317,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86074,"mean":6.8617457274639,"rank":14086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":71984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86074,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2903,"mean":5.2928394210889,"rank":581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":2322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2903,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":7.0695353535354,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":15,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
