MutL then cleaves the error-containing strand to introduce an entry point for the downstream excision reaction. Because MutL has no intrinsic ability to recognize a mismatch and discriminate between newly synthesized and template strands, the endonuclease activity of MutL is strictly regulated by ATP-binding in order to avoid nonspecific degradation of the genomic DNA. However, the activation mechanism for its endonuclease activity remains unclear. In this study, we found that the coexistence of a mismatch, ATP and MutS unlocks the ATP-binding-dependent suppression of MutL endonuclease activity. Interestingly, ATPase-deficient mutants of MutS were unable to activate MutL. Furthermore, wild-type MutS activated ATPase-deficient mutants of MutL less efficiently than wild-type MutL. We concluded that ATP hydrolysis by MutS and MutL is involved in the mismatch-dependent activation of MutL endonuclease activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b6","authors":["Shimada, Atsuhiro","Kawasoe, Yoshitaka","Hata, Yoshito","Takahashi, Tatsuro S.","Masui, Ryoji","Kuramitsu, Seiki","Fukui, Kenji"],"doi":"10.1111\/febs.12344","endpage":"3479","first_seen_on":"2013-05-16T08:29:39+00:00","issns":["1742-4658","1742-464X"],"issue":"14","journal":"FEBS Journal","last_mentioned_on":1368692757,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/febs.12344\/abstract;jsessionid=56886E7D10B222D610DB34F14C337B02.d03t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/febs.12344\/pdf","pmid":"23679952","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"3467","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"MutS stimulates the endonuclease activity of MutL in an ATP hydrolysis\u00e2\u0080\u0090dependent manner","type":"article","volume":"280","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/muts-stimulates-endonuclease-activity-mutl-atphydrolysisdependent-manner"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6509968,"mean":6.031375281317,"rank":4814470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":956787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6509968,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101120,"mean":7.1898850067743,"rank":68155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":18061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101120,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2004,"mean":1.7574268597104,"rank":1125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2004,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
