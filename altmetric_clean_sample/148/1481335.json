Students from a large, diverse, urban university (n = 397) completed a web-based survey indicating their usage patterns and preferences for multiple eHealth channels. Bivariate analyses were performed based on a measure of time availability, comprised of working status (25 h\/week or more, 1-24 h\/week, or not working) and enrollment status (full-time or part-time). Most e-health channels were broadly used by students and did not differ according to time availability. Those with the most amount of time available preferred receiving nutrition and physical activity information via social networking more frequently compared to those with the least amount of time available (60 versus 43%, P \u2264 0.05). Our study suggests that time availability may be another important factor to consider when planning cancer prevention programs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a00","authors":["Lisa M.
