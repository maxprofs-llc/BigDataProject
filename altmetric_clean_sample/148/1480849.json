Here we describe a simple procedure for quantifying mutations that result from DNA double-strand break repair via non-homologous end joining. The assay is based on the ability of the Surveyor nuclease to selectively cleave distorted duplex DNA formed via cross-annealing of mutated and wild-type sequence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","aggregated_in":[],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Guschin DY","Waite AJ","Katibah GE","Miller JC","Holmes MC","Rebar EJ","Dmitry Y.
