Peripheral vascular disease may be frequently associated in diabetes mellitus type II with its main symptom, intermittent claudication. Many studies reported the known efficacy of cilostazol in treating vascular claudication. Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) seems to be a biochemical marker implicated in chronic wounds and in particular in diabetic foot ulcers. Cilostazol seems to have also a lowering effect on levels of MMP-9 and this may suggest a beneficial effect in order to prevent or retard the onset of foot ulcer in diabetic patients. In our study two groups of diabetic patients, with peripheral vascular disease were divided into two groups according to the presence of claudication in order to receive cilostazol. Group A (31 patients without claudication) were not eligible to receive cilostazol whereas Group B (47 patients with claudication) received cilostazol administration for 24\u2009weeks (100\u2009mg orally twice daily). Median follow up was of 16\u2009months. During the follow up 4\u00b725% of patients of Group B and 35\u00b748% of patients of Group A (P\u2009<\u20090\u00b701) showed the onset of foot ulceration. Although further randomised and controlled studies are required cilostazol seems to show beneficial effects for primary prevention of diabetic foot ulcers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e83cf058f6100059c4","authors":["de Franciscis, Stefano","Gallelli, Luca","Battaglia, Luigi","Molinari, Vincenzo","Montemurro, Rossella","Stillitano, Domenico M.","Buffone, Gianluca","Serra, Raffaele"],"doi":"10.1111\/iwj.12085","endpage":"253","first_seen_on":"2013-05-16T16:33:07+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1742-481X","1742-4801"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Wound Journal","last_mentioned_on":1368743997,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/iwj.12085\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/iwj.12085\/pdf","pmid":"23672237","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"250","title":"Cilostazol prevents foot ulcers in diabetic patients withperipheral vascular disease","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cilostazol-prevents-foot-ulcers-diabetic-patients-peripheral-vascular-disease-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6673792,"mean":6.1580464815253,"rank":1490810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5155827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6673792,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115456,"mean":6.6095426616432,"rank":27853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":87015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115456,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313,"mean":3.8386025641026,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.3230769230769,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":6,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Chemistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CO":1},"mendeley":{"JP":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ROPPINEDA\/statuses\/335162733349711873","license":"public","rt":["SympoEndocrino"],"citation_ids":[1481312],"posted_on":"2013-05-16T22:39:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Roberto Pineda","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/469960606750343168\/Xyvv6iie_normal.jpeg","description":"Med int Uninorte-Residency nephrology U.rosario.","id_on_source":"ROPPINEDA","tweeter_id":"364641724","geo":{"lt":10.96854,"ln":-74.78132,"country":"CO"},"followers":354},"tweet_id":"335162733349711873"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SympoDiabetes\/statuses\/335069276308373504","license":"public","citation_ids":[1481312],"posted_on":"2013-05-16T16:28:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Symposier Diabetes","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/VgSHYnLNuu","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3284635137\/20a2295d9c9fa4754ba5030b97c2bf09_normal.jpeg","description":"Symposier integrated tweets about Diabetes.
