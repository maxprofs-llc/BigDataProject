In contrast to the significant progress in uncovering genetic lesions and prognostic factors for B-cell lineage lymphoid malignancies, prognostic markers that can predict clinical outcome of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma\/leukemia remain to be discovered and validated. Recently, specific micro-RNAs have emerged as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of various types of tumor. Among them, miR-16 is known to play important roles in the development of hematological malignancies. Using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed miR-16 expression level in archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded diagnostic lymph node specimens from a total of 72 patients with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma\/leukemia and for which clinical follow-up information was available. Although no statistically significant difference was evident in patients with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma\/leukemia versus controls with reactive lymph nodes (P = .163), T-lymphoblastic lymphoma\/leukemia patients with a greater than median expression level of miR-16 had a longer overall survival than patients with a less than median expression level. The overall 1-year survival rate was 50% for the high expression group but was 26.5% for the low expression group (P = .043). To our knowledge, we provide here the first evidence that the expression of a single micro-RNA, miR-16, is associated with clinical outcome of patients with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma\/leukemia. Therefore, miR-16 may be considered as a potential prognostic marker for T-lymphoblastic lymphoma\/leukemia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007680","authors":["Xi, Yanfeng","Li, Jing","Zan, Likun","Wang, Jinfen","Wang, Guoping","Ning, Yi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.humpath.2012.08.023","first_seen_on":"2013-05-17T23:14:37+00:00","issns":["0046-8177"],"journal":"Human Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1368819291,"links":["http:\/\/www.humanpathol.com\/article\/PIIS0046817712003267\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.humanpathol.com\/article\/S0046-8177(12)00326-7\/pdf","pmid":"23260326","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Micro-RNA-16 expression in paraffin-embedded specimen correlates with overall survival of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma\/leukemia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna16-expression-paraffinembedded-specimen-correlates-overall-survival-tlymphoblastic-lymphomal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":2742692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":729054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85832,"mean":6.9105170625999,"rank":62528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85832,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":663,"mean":1.67316918429,"rank":391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":663,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.0272727272727,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/pbaleixo\/status\/335478520140685312","license":"public","citation_ids":[1486107],"posted_on":"2013-05-17T19:34:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Pedro Aleixo","url":"http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/drpedrobandeiraaleixo\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/670632624549978112\/NIzNrtw3_normal.jpg","description":"Medical Pathologist, MD, PhD.
