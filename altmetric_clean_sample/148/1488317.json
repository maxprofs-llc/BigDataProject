We previously reported that CRP exacerbates the development of pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling through an enhanced inflammatory response and oxidative stress. In the present study, we examined the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a suppressor of inflammatory response and oxidative stress, on pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling. Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was performed on transgenic mice overexpressing CRP (CRPtg) and nontransgenic littermates (TAC\/CON). CRPtg with TAC operation were randomly assigned to be fed a standard diet (TAC\/CRPtg) or an EPA-enriched diet (7 % of total energy) (TAC\/CRPtg\/EPA). Myocardial mRNA level of transforming growth factor-\u03b21, proinflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress markers were increased in TAC\/CRPtg in comparison with TAC\/CON 1 and 4 weeks after the operation. These parameters were significantly suppressed in TAC\/CRPtg\/EPA compared with TAC\/CRPtg. In addition, after 4 weeks of EPA treatment, as compared with TAC\/CRPtg, TAC\/CRPtg\/EPA mice demonstrated reduced heart and lung weights, increased left ventricular fractional shortening, and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, together with decreased cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and improved cardiac function. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties of EPA may make it an effective therapeutic strategy for adverse cardiac remodeling associated with CRP overexpression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029ce","authors":["Toshiyuki Nagai","Toshihisa Anzai","Yoshinori Mano","Hidehiro Kaneko","Atsushi Anzai","Yasuo Sugano","Yuichiro Maekawa","Toshiyuki Takahashi","Tsutomu Yoshikawa","Keiichi Fukuda"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00380-012-0270-5","first_seen_on":"2013-05-18T06:13:58+00:00","issns":["1615-2573","0910-8327"],"journal":"Heart & Vessels","last_mentioned_on":1344810693,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00380-012-0270-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00380-012-0270-5.pdf","pmid":"22875408","pubdate":"2012-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Japan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiac Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Interventional Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vascular Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Eicosapentaenoic acid suppresses adverse effects of C-reactive protein overexpression on pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/eicosapentaenoic-acid-suppresses-adverse-effects-creactive-protein-overexpression-pressure-overloadi-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631865,"mean":4.925550910502,"rank":2898464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631865,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85785,"mean":6.9095827660171,"rank":67406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85785,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":1.2505,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.16,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
