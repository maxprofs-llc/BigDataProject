We hypothesized that the dmPFC might be more generally involved in high construal of stimuli, defined as the formation of concepts or ideas by omitting non-essential features of stimuli, irrespective of their social or non-social nature. In an fMRI study, we presented pictures of a person engaged in everyday activities (social stimuli) or of objects (non-social stimuli) and induced a higher level of construal by instructing participants to generate personality traits of the person or categories to which the objects belonged. This was contrasted against a lower level task where participants had to describe these same pictures visually. As predicted, we found strong involvement of the dmPFC in high construal, with substantial overlap across social and non-social stimuli, including shared activation in the vmPFC\/OFC, parahippocampal, fusiform and angular gyrus, precuneus, posterior cingulate and right cerebellum.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045d6","authors":["Kris Baetens","Ning Ma","Johan Steen","Frank Van Overwalle","Baetens K","Ma N","Steen J","Van Overwalle F","Baetens, Kris","Ma, Ning","Steen, Johan","Van Overwalle, Frank"],"doi":"10.1093\/scan\/nst048","endpage":"824","first_seen_on":"2013-05-16T10:09:30+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-3195837","handles":["1854\/LU-3195837"],"issns":["1749-5024","1749-5016"],"issue":"6","journal":"Social Cognitive & Affective Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1498588145,"links":["http:\/\/scan.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/05\/09\/scan.nst048.long","http:\/\/scan.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/9\/6\/817.short?rss=1","http:\/\/scan.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/9\/6\/817","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/scan\/article\/9\/6\/817\/1666662\/Involvement-of-the-mentalizing-network-in-social","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/scan\/nst048"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/scan\/article-pdf\/9\/6\/817\/14137343\/nst048.pdf","pmid":"23552077","pubdate":"2013-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"817","subjects":["socialsciences","neurology"],"title":"Involvement of the mentalizing network in social and non-social high construal","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/involvement-mentalizing-network-social-nonsocial-high-construal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.25,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":775581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7649786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123027,"mean":6.984951197308,"rank":12553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":110397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123027,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1202,"mean":17.758316402997,"rank":337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1202,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":29.043230769231,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
