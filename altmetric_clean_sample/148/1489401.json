The ARM represents a simple, quick and totally non invasive tool for the investigation of the upper airways, requiring minimal cooperation, which makes this technique particularly suitable for children. Normal values of the minimal cross sectional area of the upper airways in children have been recently published. The ARM has shown its utility in the investigation of the nasal cavity in healthy and diseased children and of the upper airways in children with various diseases such as mucopolysaccharidosis and cystic fibrosis. This simple, rapid, and inexpensive technique seems promising for the non-invasive investigation of the whole upper airway during wakefulness in children, both in health and disease, and may constitute a complementary or alternative method to explore and follow children with anomalies of the upper airways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008434","authors":["Leboulanger N","Louis B","Fauroux B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.prrv.2013.04.001","first_seen_on":"2013-05-18T10:46:50+00:00","issns":["1526-0550"],"journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1428702875,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23680443?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23680443?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23680443","pubdate":"2013-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"The acoustic reflection method for the assessment of paediatric upper airways.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acoustic-reflection-method-assessment-paediatric-upper-airways"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4980609,"mean":5.8933407017814,"rank":2468381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2361243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4980609,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93517,"mean":7.2986890799436,"rank":43450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":47091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93517,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230,"mean":1.6071091703057,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.43076923076923,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2,"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"PE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ACNPed\/statuses\/335707096366596096","license":"public","citation_ids":[1489401],"posted_on":"2013-05-18T10:43:03+00:00","author":{"name":"ACNP","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687251577\/logo_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Neumolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","id_on_source":"ACNPed","tweeter_id":"434250807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":157},"tweet_id":"335707096366596096"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/status\/586648495139852288","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1489401],"posted_on":"2015-04-10T21:54:35+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"586648495139852288"}]}}
