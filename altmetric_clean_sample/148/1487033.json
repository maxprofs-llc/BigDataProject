Immediate studies were made at Discovery Bay, where reef populations were already known in some detail. Data are presented to show how damage varied with the position and orientation of the substraturn and with the shape, size, and mechanical properties of exposed organisms. Data collected over succeeding weeks showed striking differences in the ability of organisms to heal and survive.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1981Sci...214..749W","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Woodley, J D","Chornesky, E A","Clifford, P A","Jackson, J B","Kaufman, L S","Knowlton, N","Lang, J C","Pearson, M P","Porter, J W","Rooney, M C","Rylaarsdam, K W","Tunnicliffe, V J","Wahle, C M","Wulff, J L","Curtis, A S","Dallmeyer, M D","Jupp, B P","Koehl, M A","Neigel, J","Sides, E M","J.
