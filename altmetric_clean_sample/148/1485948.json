Recently, the disease causing gene has been discovered (L2HGDH) encoding L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase. We present a 3-year-old boy with L-2-HGA, who demonstrated macrocephaly, noted already in utero with ultrasound. Cranial MRI demonstrated diffuse subcortical encephalopathy with increased signal of the subcortical white matter. Subsequent metabolic screening revealed increased levels of L-2-HGA, and genomic DNA analysis demonstrated two missense mutations in L-2-HGDG. Patient's further motor development was mildly impaired, whilst his speech development was profoundly impaired (first words at the age of 2 years). Since the age of 2 years he started demonstrating autistic repetitive behaviors and movements, increasing aloofness to his environment and limitations in the variety of spontaneous activity (CARS score: 44\/60-severe autism). Autism has not so far been described in L-2-HGA and may be considered as an additional feature of the phenotypic spectrum.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002425","authors":["Zafeiriou, D I","Ververi, A","Salomons, G S","Vargiami, E","Haas, D","Papadopoulou, V","Kontopoulos, E","Jakobs, C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.braindev.2007.09.005","first_seen_on":"2013-05-17T23:10:26+00:00","issns":["0387-7604"],"issue":"4","journal":"Brain & Development","last_mentioned_on":1314135240,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17981416"],"pmid":"17981416","pubdate":"2008-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","pediatrics"],"title":"L-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria presenting with severe autistic features.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/l2hydroxyglutaric-aciduria-presenting-severe-autistic-features"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.44,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.44},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9469155541215,"rank":552390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3132284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86174,"mean":6.8948243881494,"rank":16031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":70130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86174,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":2.0505864661654,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.57,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
