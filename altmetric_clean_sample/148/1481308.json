This introduces \"biclustering\", or simultaneous clustering of both genes and conditions, to knowledge discovery from expression data. This approach overcomes some problems associated with traditional clustering methods, by allowing automatic discovery of similarity based on a subset of attributes, simultaneous clustering of genes and conditions, and overlapped grouping that provides a better representation for genes with multiple functions or regulated by many factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005771","authors":["Cheng, Y","Church, G M"],"first_seen_on":"2013-05-16T16:31:42+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1553-0833"],"journal":"Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings","last_mentioned_on":1428176566,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10977070"],"pmid":"10977070","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Biclustering of expression data.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/realistic-mathematically-tractable-graph-generation-evolution-using-kronecker-multiplication"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7571218,"mean":6.5337981331095,"rank":1567591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5952546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7571218,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118878,"mean":6.7210895968103,"rank":25755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":92450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118878,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":626,"mean":6.0256032,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":626,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":6.6722222222222,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
