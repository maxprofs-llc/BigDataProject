Researchers who conducted a recent prospective study of older adults reported that animal protein had a protective role for bone, especially in elderly women, whereas plant protein was negatively associated with bone mineral density. An interaction between protein and calcium suggested protein alone was not the important factor. Other studies confirm the beneficial effect of increasing dietary protein intake in older women to reduce bone mineral density loss and risk of fracture, suggesting that emphasis should be placed on promoting adequate protein intake in elderly women.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003220","authors":["Bell, Janet","Whiting, Susan J"],"first_seen_on":"2013-05-18T07:58:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0029-6643"],"issue":"10 Pt 1","journal":"Nutrition Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1368662400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12392151"],"pmid":"12392151","pubdate":"2002-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Elderly women need dietary protein to maintain bone mass.","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/elderly-women-need-dietary-protein-maintain-bone-mass"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620975,"mean":4.929685029501,"rank":2904408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":72107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620975,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85500,"mean":6.9396234809764,"rank":67498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85500,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":606,"mean":6.5488991735537,"rank":528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":606,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NZ":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Elderly women need dietary protein to maintain bone...
