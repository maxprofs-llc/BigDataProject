Various predictors for the contaminant levels were also investigated. The samples were collected in six counties, representing South, Central and North Norway in 2002-2006. Initial results showed significantly lower levels of OCPs in breast milk from ethnic Norwegians (N=377) compared to ethnic non-Norwegians (N=46). Median concentrations (range) of PCBs, p,p'-DDE, HCB, beta-HCH and oxychlordane in breast milk of the Norwegian women, all parities included, were 103 (34-450), 41 (5.4-492), 11 (3.6-24), 4.7 (0.9-37) and 2.8 (0.5-16) ng\/g lipid weight, respectively. Results indicated that sum of 18 PCBs, p,p'-DDE and beta-HCH are good predictors for monitoring of PCB, DDT and HCH levels in Norwegian breast milk. Multivariable linear regression analyses showed that age was strongly associated with increasing OC levels (P<0.001), whereas parity was associated with decreasing OC levels (P<0.001). Smoking was associated with higher levels of PCBs, p,p'-DDE and beta-HCH. The models explained from 17 to 35% of the variance. Median levels of OCs in the present Norwegian primparaes seemed to be 29-62% lower than corresponding results found in a Norwegian study from 2000-2002.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Polder A","Skaare JU","Skjerve E","L\u00f8ken KB","Eggesb\u00f8 M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2009.04.032","first_seen_on":"2013-05-17T23:09:49+00:00","issns":["0048-9697"],"issue":"16","journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1307298960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19457543"],"pmid":"19457543","pubdate":"2009-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Levels of chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls in Norwegian breast milk (2002-2006), and factors that may predict the level of contamination.","type":"article","volume":"407","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/levels-chlorinated-pesticides-polychlorinated-biphenyls-norwegian-breast-milk-20022006-factors-predi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.44,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.44},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9523304688866,"rank":552586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3132088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86175,"mean":6.9058210597163,"rank":16032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":70130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86175,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1473,"mean":3.4822934782609,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1473,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":6.3469387755102,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
