However, a suitable donor is not always found. Because HSPC are known for their relative resistance to hypoxia, using an experimental murine model, we explored cadaveric bone marrow (BM) as their alternative source. After donor mice were sacrificed, BM was left in intact femurs at 37\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, or 4\u00b0C under ischemic conditions, resulting in combined oxygen and metabolic substrate shortage and the accumulation of metabolic waste products. BM cells were harvested after a set time period ranging from 0 to 48 hours. To determine the impact of delayed harvesting on the transplantability of HSPC, a competitive repopulation assay using a murine Ly5.1\/Ly5.2 congenic model in 2 different settings was used: after submyeloablative (6 Gy) or myeloablative (9 Gy) total-body irradiation, Ly5.2 hosts received cadaveric Ly5.1 cells or a mixture of cadaveric Ly5.1 cells and fresh Ly5.2 cells in a 1:1 ratio. Chimerism resulting from cadaveric donor cells, followed up to 6 months after transplantation, proved that the long-term repopulation ability of HSPC was fully preserved for 2 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours at 37\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, and 4\u00b0C of ischemia, respectively. A colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) clonogenic assay revealed a higher sensitivity of proliferating hematopoietic progenitors to ischemia compared to repopulating cells (STRC and LTRC). Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis in cadaveric BM demonstrated that the LSK (Lin(low)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+)) subpopulation, enriched in HSPC, contained less apoptotic and dead cells than the BM as a whole. Furthermore, the number of LSK SLAM (CD150(+)CD48(-)) and LSK SP (side population) cells (fractions highly enriched in hematopoietic stem cells) decreased in parallel with BM transplantability. As well as cadaveric BM cells, we also tested the transplantability and survival of BM cells after storage in a suspension in vitro without specific hematopoietic growth factors. HSPC did not display any decrease in transplantability after 2 days of storage at 37\u00b0C or 4 days at 4\u00b0C. A higher sensitivity of progenitors to unfavorable conditions was observed again using CFU-S and granulocyte macrophage-colony forming cell (GM-CFC) assays, especially at 37\u00b0C. This paper shows that HSPC survive the cessation of circulation for a considerable time and maintain their engraftment potential. This time is significantly extended with in vitro storage compared to the cadaveric BM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e3","authors":["Michalova J","Savvulidi F","Sefc L","Faltusova K","Forgacova K","Necas E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbmt.2011.07.007","endpage":"1281","first_seen_on":"2013-05-17T16:46:46+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1083-8791","10838791"],"issue":"9","journal":"Biology of Blood & Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1339642049,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21767513"],"pmid":"21767513","pubdate":"2011-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1273","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Hematopoietic stem cells survive circulation arrest and reconstitute hematopoiesis in myeloablated mice.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hematopoietic-stem-cells-survive-circulation-arrest-reconstitute-hematopoiesis-myeloablated-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.88,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.88},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":507333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3127288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85915,"mean":6.900893637824,"rank":15158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":70750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85915,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":606,"mean":2.1484132231405,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":606,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.5861111111111,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
