Visual acuity, corneal topography, contrast sensitivity (CS), and wavefront aberrations were recorded preoperatively and compared with postoperative measurements. Objective scatter index (OSI) and modulation transfer function (MTF) cut-off frequency were measured 1 year postoperatively.\nOne year postoperatively, the two groups demonstrated no significant difference in the CS at all spatial frequencies. The increments of higher-order aberrations (HOAs) (HOA = 0.583 \u00b1 0.210 \u03bcm), including spherical aberration (SA) (SA = 0.546 \u00b1 0.249 \u03bcm), were higher (P < 0.05) in the LASEK group than those in the SMILE group (HOA = 0.451 \u00b1 0.143 \u03bcm; SA = 0.450 \u00b1 0.340 \u03bcm) after surgery. There were no significant differences in the increments of coma and trefoil aberrations between the two groups. The OSI and MTF cut-off frequency exhibited no significant differences between the two groups postoperatively. No vision-threatening complications were noted at any stage in either group.\nBoth LASEK and SMILE are safe and effective surgical options for the correction of high myopia. SMILE has a lower HOAs and SA induction rate 1 year postoperatively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Xiaoyu Zhu","Leilei Zou","Manrong Yu","Chen Qiu","Minjie Chen","Jinhui Dai"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0182251","first_seen_on":"2017-08-03T18:07:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1501783628,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0182251&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0182251&type=printable","pmid":"28771544","pubdate":"2017-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0182251","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Comparison of postoperative visual quality after SMILE and LASEK for high myopia: A 1-year outcome","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-postoperative-visual-quality-after-smile-lasek-high-myopia-1year-outcome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":7191425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175626,"mean":11.835928905338,"rank":143826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175626,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115030,"mean":10.606997157239,"rank":97007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115030,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2745,"mean":9.5232091836735,"rank":2158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2745,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/neuropapersbot\/statuses\/893171390106312705","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23396785],"posted_on":"2017-08-03T18:07:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Neuroscience Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"hi there, I am a twitter bot who tweets new papers in neuroscience","id_on_source":"neuropapersbot","tweeter_id":"757895584317440000","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":22},"tweet_id":"893171390106312705"}]}}
