The present research was carried out to study the impact of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor (PAI-1) 4G\/5G polymorphism (rs1799889) in PCOS, and the risk of developing PCOS in South Indian Population. The study was carried out in 60 subjects of South Indian population (30 PCOS and 30 Non PCOS) recruited from ARC Research and Fertility Centre, Chennai, India. Genotype and Allelic frequencies were compared by Fisher exact test, Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Genotype frequency difference between PCOS and non-PCOS was observed as statistically non-significant (p=0.4647, OR=1.3077, 95% CI 0.63-2.68). The allelic frequency distribution in Spontaneous Abortion (SAB) cases in total subjects is not found to be statistically significant (p=0. 29), however the PCOS women carrying mutant homozygous and heterozygous genotype are more prone to recurrent pregnancy loss. Out of 17 Implantation failure cases, 23.52% were found to carry mutant homozygous (4G\/4G), and 66.66% carried mutant heterozygous (4G\/5G), and 5.88% carried wild type homozygous (5G\/5G), the allelic difference was highly significant with 4G (62.5%), and 5G (37.5%). P value is highly significant and recorded at p=0.0164. The positive correlation between PAI-1 4G\/5G polymorphism and PCOS risk was not observed in this study, however, the correlation between Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) and Implantation failures were observed in PCOS cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f6100039b8","authors":["Mary, Maniraja Jesintha","Saravanan, Lakshmanan","Deecaraman, Munuswamy","Vijayalakshmi, Melantharu","Umashankar, Vetrivel","Sailaja, Jaigopal"],"doi":"10.6026\/97320630013149","first_seen_on":"2017-08-03T21:23:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0973-8894","0973-2063"],"issue":"5","journal":"Bioinformation","last_mentioned_on":1501795383,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28690381\/?i=46&from=pcos"],"pmcid":"PMC5498781","pmid":"28690381","pubdate":"2017-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Biomedical Informatics","title":"Polymorphism of the PAI-1gene (4G\/5G) may be linked with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and associated pregnancy disorders in South Indian Women","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymorphism-pai1gene-4g5g-linked-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-associated-pregnancy-disorders-south-ind"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":6311310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1126053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175631,"mean":11.835714650117,"rank":124251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175631,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":1.3379161290323,"rank":157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
