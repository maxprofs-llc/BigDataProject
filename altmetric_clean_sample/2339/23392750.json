The issues addressed in his work have included social discrimination, human rights, health, and the environment. Creating an expressive alternate vision in a pervading regressive body politic has never been easy and therein lies the challenge he calls \"Creative Defiance.\" The article is from a presentation which was made at the University of Massachusetts Lowell in 2016.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100066ae","authors":["Chaz
