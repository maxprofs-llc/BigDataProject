Observational and intervention studies of all languages on eating patterns and nutrient intake in adolescent (10- to 19-year-old) competitive athletes were included. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using a Downs and Black instrument. Moreover, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) evidence system was used to assess the strength of the body of evidence.\nRegarding outcomes of 21 included articles, 95.2% of studies focused on nutrient analysis, whereas few of the included articles reported eating patterns. As determinants, most studies analyzed the influences of sport-related (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and demographic factors (n\u00a0=\u00a08), among which only sport modalities were significantly associated with nutrient intake. Age and sex were not significantly associated with nutrient intake. All studies were observational, and most were cross-sectional (n\u00a0=\u00a017) and conducted in developed countries such as the United States and European nations. Most studies evaluated boys, and the sport that received the most attention was soccer.\nAthletes do not adjust their nutrient intake or food choice to the demands of the training load or different training sessions, while sport modalities significantly influenced nutrient intake. Moreover, results concerning demographic determinants were inconsistent and thus remain inconclusive.\nProspero CRD42016043310 .","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000087d","authors":["Matias Noll","Carolina Rodrigues de Mendon\u00e7a","Lorena Pereira de Souza Rosa","Erika Aparecida Silveira","Matias Noll","Carolina Rodrigues de Mendon\u00e7a","Lorena Pereira de Souza Rosa","Erika Aparecida Silveira"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12937-017-0267-0","first_seen_on":"2017-08-03T19:50:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-2891"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nutrition Journal","last_mentioned_on":1502219261,"links":["https:\/\/nutritionj.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12937-017-0267-0"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/nutritionj.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12937-017-0267-0?site=nutritionj.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28754133","pubdate":"2017-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Nutrition","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"46","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Determinants of eating patterns and nutrient intake among adolescent athletes: a systematic review","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determinants-eating-patterns-nutrient-intake-among-adolescent-athletes-systematic-review-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.15,"score_history":{"1y":6.15,"6m":6.15,"3m":6.15,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":1366758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6973856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189091,"mean":12.397856533926,"rank":41487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":147465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189091,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":903,"mean":25.335951219512,"rank":451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":903,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":9.6306666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NZ":2,"AU":1,"GB":2,"ES":1,"CA":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/daveshawnz\/statuses\/893197302092910592","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23398092],"posted_on":"2017-08-03T19:50:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Shaw","url":"http:\/\/www.daveshaw.co.nz","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/800166400803209216\/nVOKN2Xm_normal.jpg","description":"NZRD | Performance Nutritionist for @BluesRugbyTeam, @AucklandRugby & @HPSportNZ | PhD(c) Exercise Immunology at @AUTuni | Opinions are my own.","id_on_source":"daveshawnz","tweeter_id":"853759843","geo":{"lt":-36.85,"ln":174.78333,"country":"NZ"},"followers":704},"tweet_id":"893197302092910592"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/michaelleveritt\/statuses\/893264743942828032","license":"gnip","rt":["daveshawnz"],"citation_ids":[23398092],"posted_on":"2017-08-04T00:18:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Michael Leveritt","url":"http:\/\/www.michaelleveritt.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1846637721\/Leveritt_normal.jpg","description":"Senior Lecturer in Nutrition and Dietetics, The University of Queensland.
