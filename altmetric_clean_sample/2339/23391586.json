CoQ10 also functions as a lipid-soluble antioxidant by protecting lipids, proteins and DNA damaged by oxidative stress. CoQ10 deficiency has been associated with a number of human diseases including mitochondrial diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and with the ageing process. In many of these conditions CoQ10 supplementation therapy has been effective in slowing or reversing pathological changes. Oxidative stress is a major contributory factor in the process of retinal degeneration. In this brief review, we summarize the functions of CoQ10 and highlight its use in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. In light of these data we propose that CoQ10 could have therapeutic potential for other retinal diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002693","authors":["Zhang , Xun  "," Tohari , Ali  Mohammad"," Marcheggiani , Fabio "," Zhou, Xinzhi ","Reilly, James  "," Tiano , Luca "," Shu, Xinhua "],"doi":"10.2174\/0929867324666170801100516","first_seen_on":"2017-08-03T13:18:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0929-8673","1875-533X"],"journal":"Current Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1501860526,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28762311?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=buffer51d5b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2174\/0929867324666170801100516"],"pmid":"28762311","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Therapeutic potential of co-enzyme Q10 in retinal diseases","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":2.1,"3m":2.1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":3570655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4713239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176769,"mean":11.956856557748,"rank":68394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":106777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176769,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1047,"mean":3.3800975143403,"rank":487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1047,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.89137931034483,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/glaucoma_es\/statuses\/893098635570839552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23391586],"posted_on":"2017-08-03T13:18:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Glaucoma","url":"http:\/\/glaucoma.org.es\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/743843987317006336\/4mGPFKoQ_normal.jpg","description":"Noticias sobre glaucoma, novedades, tratamientos, reflexiones","id_on_source":"glaucoma_es","tweeter_id":"743741220069879809","geo":{"lt":40,"ln":-4,"country":"ES"},"followers":2957},"tweet_id":"893098635570839552"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MemaEmma53\/statuses\/893257772187496449","license":"gnip","rt":["glaucoma_es"],"citation_ids":[23391586],"posted_on":"2017-08-03T23:50:23+00:00","author":{"name":"CHAVEZ","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/499551746390491136\/diCOTQfm_normal.jpeg","description":"Chavista Socialista Latinoamricana y Caribe\u00f1a, SOY RAMA DEL \u00c1RBOL DE LAS 4 RAICES.
