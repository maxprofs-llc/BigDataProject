This study explored the role of metacognitions as mediators of anxiety in a sample comprising of cisgender and transgender individuals.\nOne-hundred and twenty-five individuals (19 trans-male; 24 male; 25 trans-female; 57 female) completed a series of measures that assessed metacognitions, worry and anxiety.\nCorrelation analyses were used to identify potential mediators of the relationship between gender identity and anxiety. A mediation model indicated that beliefs about thoughts concerning uncontrollability and danger entirely mediated the relationship between gender identity and anxiety (b\u2009=\u20092.00, bias corrected and accelerated confidence interval [0.68, 3.49]).\nMetacognitions play an important role in anxiety in transgender individuals.\n-Metacognitions were found to mediate anxiety in transgender and cisgender individuals. -The exploration of metacognitions in transgender individuals experiencing psychological distress may have clinical utility.
