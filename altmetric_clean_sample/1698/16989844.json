However, executive functioning is a multifaceted construct, and it is not clear whether deficits in specific components of executive functioning are differentially associated with IPA perpetration generally and within the context of problematic alcohol use. To address this question, the present study investigated the effects of problematic drinking and components of executive functioning on physical IPA perpetration within a dyadic framework.\nParticipants were 582 heavy drinking couples (total n\u2009=\u20091164) with a recent history of psychological and\/or physical IPA recruited from two metropolitan cities in the USA. Multilevel models were used to examine effects within an actor-partner interdependence framework.\nThe highest levels of physical IPA were observed among actors who reported everyday consequences of executive functioning deficits related to emotional dysregulation whose partners were problematic drinkers. However, the association between executive functioning deficits related to emotional dysregulation and IPA was stronger towards partners who were non-problematic drinkers relative to partners who were problematic drinkers. No such effect was found for executive functioning deficits related to behavioural regulation.\nResults provide insight into how problematic drinking and specific executive functioning deficits interact dyadically in relation to physical IPA perpetration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002733","authors":["Parrott, Dominic J.","Swartout, Kevin M.","Eckhardt, Christopher I.","Subramani, Olivia S."],"doi":"10.1111\/dar.12454","endpage":"96","first_seen_on":"2017-03-04T21:20:12+00:00","issns":["09595236","1465-3362"],"issue":"1","journal":"Drug & Alcohol Review","last_mentioned_on":1489018948,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dar.12454\/abstract;jsessionid=5B835B0460E68B6087A3079EF98CBB5C.f04t02?systemMessage=WOL+Usage+report+download+page+will+be+unavailable+on+Friday+27th+January+2017+at+23%3A00+GMT%2F+18%3A00+EST%2F+07%3A00+SGT+%28Saturday+28th+Jan+for+SGT%29++for+up+to+2+hours+due+to+essential+server+maintenance.+Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dar.12454\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dar.12454\/pdf","pmid":"28116760","pubdate":"2017-01-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"88","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Deconstructing the associations between executive functioning, problematic alcohol use and intimate partner aggression: A dyadic analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/dar.12454","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deconstructing-associations-between-executive-functioning-problematic-alcohol-intimate-partner-aggre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.13,"score_history":{"1y":10.13,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.13},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":842845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7488272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241936,"mean":13.730324359848,"rank":40685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":201247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241936,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":942,"mean":7.4524824654623,"rank":172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":942,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":9.2018918918919,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":7,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":2},"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Deconstructing the associations between executive functioning, problematic alcohol use and intimate partner aggression: A dyadic analysis","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/2017\/journal-article-abstracts\/deconstructing-associations-executive-functioning-problematic-alcohol-use-intimate-partner-aggression-dyadic-analysis\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[16989844],"posted_on":"2017-03-04T21:12:00+00:00","summary":"&hellip;\nView original:\nDeconstructing the associations between executive functioning, problematic alcohol use and intimate partner aggression: A dyadic analysis\nThe post Deconstructing the associations between executive functioning, problematic alcohol us","author":{"name":"information for practice","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/","description":"news, new scholarship &amp;
