Logistic regression and linear mixed models were used to determine the association between the CIADIS weighted scores and confirmed eGFR\u200a<\u200a60\u200amL\/min\/1.73 m, and evolution of eGFR, respectively.\nOf 756 patients with an undetectable viral load, 76% were men and median age was 51 years (IQR: 45-57 years). In multivariable analysis, the soluble-CIADIS weighted score was independently associated with a confirmed eGFR\u200a<\u200a60 (OR\u200a=\u200a1.4; 95% CI 1.1; 1.8) but the cellular-CIADIS weighted score was not (OR\u200a=\u200a1.2; 95% CI 1.0; 1.5). Only in patients with a confirmed eGFR\u200a<\u200a60 at inclusion, a higher soluble-CIADIS weighted score (increased inflammation) was associated with a steeper decrease of renal function of -2.3\u200amL\/min\/1.73 m per year (95% CI -3.6; -1.0).\nAt inclusion, soluble-CIADIS weighted score was independently associated with a confirmed eGFR\u200a<\u200a60. The soluble-CIADIS weighted score was associated with a decrease of eGFR evolution during a 3 years follow-up only in patients with a confirmed eGFR\u200a<\u200a60.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006920","authors":["Ozanne, Alexandra","Duffau, Pierre","Dauchy, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Antoine","Rigothier, Claire","Terrien, C\u00e9cile","Lazaro, Estibaliz","Cazanave, Charles","Lawson-ayayi, Sylvie","Bonnet, Fabrice","Blanco, Patrick","Wittkop, Linda","Pellegrin, Isabelle","for the CIADIS sub-study in the ANRS CO3 Aquitaine cohort study group"],"doi":"10.1097\/qad.0000000000001461","first_seen_on":"2017-03-23T06:01:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0269-9370","1473-5571"],"journal":"AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1490248865,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Activation,_senescence_and_inflammation_markers_in.97536.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/9000\/00000\/Activation,_senescence_and_inflammation_markers_in.97536.pdf","pmid":"28328797","pubdate":"2017-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Activation, senescence and inflammation markers in HIV patients","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Activation,_senescence_and_inflammation_markers_in.97536.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activation-senescence-inflammation-markers-hiv-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":6377707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1140357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248572,"mean":13.342058743779,"rank":178900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248572,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622,"mean":4.9404965479149,"rank":3164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":14.896666666667,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Sports and Recreations":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AIDS_Journal\/statuses\/844791086602117120","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18028727],"posted_on":"2017-03-23T06:01:05+00:00","author":{"name":"AIDS Journal","url":"http:\/\/www.aidsonline.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1653594469\/AIDS_cover_square_normal.jpg","description":"Publishing the very latest ground breaking research on HIV and AIDS, AIDS has the highest impact of all AIDS-related journals.","id_on_source":"AIDS_Journal","tweeter_id":"419442651","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":923},"tweet_id":"844791086602117120"}]}}
