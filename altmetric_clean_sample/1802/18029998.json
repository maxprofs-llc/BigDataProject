Use of regional anaesthesia alone or in combination with general anaesthesia improves pulmonary functions and reduces the incidence of post-operative pulmonary complications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003d82","authors":["Devika Rani Duggappa","G Venkateswara Rao","Sudheesh Kannan"],"doi":"10.4103\/0019-5049.165859","first_seen_on":"2017-03-23T08:00:01+00:00","issns":["0019-5049"],"issue":"9","journal":"Indian Journal of Anaesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1490098020,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4613404\/"],"pmid":"26556916","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"574","title":"Anaesthesia for patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.ijaweb.org\/text.asp?2015\/59\/9\/574\/165859","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anaesthesia-patient-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":7254151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248273,"mean":13.339544902365,"rank":205709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248273,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":373,"mean":1.6765215053763,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":373,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.4666666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Anaesthesia for patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=774963732673090&id=533234623512670","license":"public","citation_ids":[18029998],"posted_on":"2017-03-21T12:07:00+00:00","summary":"The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has become a disease of public health importance.
