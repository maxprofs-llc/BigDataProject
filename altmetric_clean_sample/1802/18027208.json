BSG was determined using radiographic criteria. Age at diagnosis, tumor location and appearance, clinical symptoms, treatment, and presence of a concurrent optic pathway glioma were assessed.\nThe average age at BSG diagnosis was 7.2 years, and tumors occurred most often in the midbrain and medulla (66%). The majority of children with NF1-BSGs were asymptomatic (54%) and were not treated (88%). Only 9 of the 72 asymptomatic children received treatment because of progressive tumor enlargement. In contrast, 61 children presented with clinical signs\/symptoms attributable to their BSG; these individuals were older and more often had focal lesions. Thirty-one patients underwent treatment for their tumor, and 14 received CSF diversion only. Progression-free survival was \u223c3 years shorter for children receiving tumor-directed therapy relative to those who had either no treatment or CSF diversion only. Overall survival was 85% for the tumor-directed therapy group, whereas no deaths were reported in the untreated or CSF diversion groups.\nUnlike children with sporadically occurring BSGs, most children with NF1-BSGs were asymptomatic, and few individuals died from complications of their tumor. Those requiring tumor-directed treatment tended to be older children with focal lesions, and had clinically more aggressive disease relative to those who were not treated or underwent CSF diversion only.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Jasia Mahdi","Amish C.
