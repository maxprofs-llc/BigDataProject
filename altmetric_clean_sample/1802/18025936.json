Recent progress in cellular reprogramming technology may allow the transplantation of a patient's own pancreatic cells. Although many studies have reported the differentiation of pancreatic progenitor cells from mouse and human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), obtaining sufficient cell numbers for clinical applications remains problematic. Here, we describe the mass production of human pancreatic progenitor cells from human induced (i)PSCs using a three-dimensional suspension bioreactor system. Bioreactor culture of cells with stage-specific provision of growth factors and small compounds for 17\u2005days produced approximately 1.6\u2005\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\u200510(8) \u2005cells\/100\u2005ml vessel in a single batch. About 95% of cells expressed pancreatic and duodenal homeobox factor 1, and 22% co-expressed the transcription factor NKX6.1. Furthermore, culture of pancreatic progenitor cells for an additional 2\u2005weeks yielded mature pancreatic cells, including C-peptide-, glucagon- and trypsin-expressing cell populations. Moreover, differentiated \u03b2-cells secreted insulin in response to increased glucose in vitro. These findings suggest that a three-dimensional suspension culture system can generate human pancreatic progenitor cells from human iPSCs. Further optimization of culture conditions should provide sufficient functional islet cells for transplantation therapy.
