Thus far, conventional sequencing of small RNA libraries from rice led to the identification of most of the conserved miRNAs. Deep sequencing of small RNA libraries is an effective approach to uncover rare and lineage- and\/or species-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in any organism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d4","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2229-8-25","first_seen_on":"2012-12-20T00:20:23+00:00","issns":["1471-2229"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Plant Biology","last_mentioned_on":1355962811,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2229\/8\/25\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcplantbiol\/content\/pdf\/1471-2229-8-25.pdf","pmid":"18312648","pubdate":"2008-02-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agriculture","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tree Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"25","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Identification of novel and candidate miRNAs in rice by high throughput sequencing","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-novel-candidate-mirnas-rice-high-throughput-sequencing-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3072640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":950114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282893,"mean":5.9348837931082,"rank":190487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":53433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282893,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":776,"mean":2.5308490322581,"rank":485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":776,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":8.7057948717949,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":14,"Researcher":38,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
