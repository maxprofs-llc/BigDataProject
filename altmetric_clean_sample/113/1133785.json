Adequate zinc status is essential for T-cell division, maturation and differentiation; lymphocyte response to mitogens; programmed cell death of lymphoid and myeloid origins; gene transcription; and biomembrane function. Lymphocytes are one of the types of cells activated by zinc. Zinc is the structural component of a wide variety of proteins, neuropeptides, hormone receptors and polynucleotides. Among the best known zinc-dependent hormones\/enzymes are Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase, an enzyme component of the antioxidant defense system, and thymulin, which is essential for the formation of T-lymphocytes. In animals and humans, zinc deficiency results in rapid and marked atrophy of the thymus, impaired cell-mediated cutaneous sensitivity and lymphopenia. Primary and secondary antibody responses are reduced in zinc deficiency, particularly for those antigens that require T-cell help, such as those in heterologous red blood cells. In addition, antibody response and the generation of splenic cytotoxic T cells after immunization are reduced. Zinc also inhibits the production of tumor necrosis factor, which is implicated in the pathophysiology of cachexia and wasting in acquired immune deficiency syndrome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Adriana Campa"],"first_seen_on":"2012-12-19T17:12:42+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1541-6100","0022-3166"],"issue":"5S Suppl","journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1381606219,"links":["http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/130\/5\/1421S.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/130\/5\/1421S.full.pdf","pmid":"10801954","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Zinc Status in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection","type":"article","volume":"130","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zinc-status-human-immunodeficiency-virus-infection-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8284220,"mean":6.9847184954847,"rank":7163806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8284220,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297565,"mean":6.8524453562931,"rank":249334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297565,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3945,"mean":14.147851926978,"rank":3642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3945,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":13.583596059113,"rank":202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
