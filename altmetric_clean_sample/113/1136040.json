A total of 142 articles (152 studies) that met review criteria were included. Nearly all (95%) of these experiments provided an operational definition of the independent variable, but only 30% of the studies provided treatment integrity data. Nearly half of studies (45%) were judged to be at high risk for treatment inaccuracies. Treatment integrity data were more likely to be included in studies that used teachers, multiple treatment agents, or both. Although there was a substantial increase in reporting operational definitions of independent variables, results suggest that there was only a modest improvement in reported integrity over the past 30 years of JABA studies. Recommendations for research and practice are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8c","authors":["Laura Lee McIntyre","Frank M Gresham","Florence D DiGennaro","Derek D Reed"],"doi":"10.1901\/jaba.2007.659-672","first_seen_on":"2012-12-20T18:49:14+00:00","issns":["0021-8855"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1356029387,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2078573\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2078573","pmid":"18189097","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"659","subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Treatment Integrity of School-Based Interventions with Children in the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis 1991-2005","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-integrity-schoolbased-interventions-children-journal-applied-behavior-analysis-19912005-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628597,"mean":4.9402458135364,"rank":2902959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628597,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278190,"mean":5.728769570328,"rank":222002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278190,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":549,"mean":5.9911715328467,"rank":442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":549,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.1108695652174,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
