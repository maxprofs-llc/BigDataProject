Four of the five deteriorated rapidly and died within 36 h after falling. X-rays for fractures were negative. Four of the five patients were taking corticosteroids daily. All five patients fulfilled the clinical criteria for Fat Embolism Syndrome. Autopsy findings were consistent with fat embolism in two cases. Fat Embolism Syndrome needs to be considered in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy following minor trauma even without fractures. Early recognition of Fat Embolism Syndrome and aggressive resuscitation are important to improve survival. This report serves as an important reminder that seatbelts need to be used at all times.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319b","authors":["McAdam LC","Rastogi A","Macleod K","Douglas Biggar W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nmd.2012.07.010","first_seen_on":"2012-12-21T20:16:29+00:00","issns":["0960-8966"],"issue":"","journal":"Neuromuscular Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1355702400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22920089","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.nmd.2012.07.010"],"pmid":"22920089","pubdate":"2012-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Fat Embolism Syndrome following minor trauma in Duchenne muscular dystrophy","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fat-embolism-syndrome-following-minor-trauma-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":2016015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278243,"mean":5.7260147569382,"rank":148844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":79526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278243,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":506,"mean":1.3924198019802,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":506,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.2433333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/717967460","license":"public","citation_ids":[1138352],"posted_on":"2012-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["new_finding"],"f1000_score":"1"}]}}
