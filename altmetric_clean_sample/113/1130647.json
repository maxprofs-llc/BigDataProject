An attempt was made to improve the laccase production by T. versicolor through supplementing the cultures with inducers, such as 2,2-azino bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), copper sulfate, ethanol, gallic acid, veratryl alcohol, and phenol. A higher laccase activity of 13506.2 \u00b1 138.2 IU\/gds (gram dry substrate) was obtained with a phenol concentration of 10 mg\/kg substrate in a tray bioreactor after 12 days of incubation time. The flocculation properties of the laccase treated crude beer samples have been studied by using various parameters, such as viscosity, turbidity, \u03b6 potential, total polyphenols, and total protein content. The present results indicated that laccase (25 IU\/L) showed promising results as a good flocculating agent. The laccase treatment showed better flocculation capacity compared to the industrial flocculation process using stabifix as a flocculant. The laccase treatments (25 IU\/L) at 4 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C and room temperature have shown almost similar flocculation properties without much variability. The study demonstrated the potential of in-house produced laccase using brewer's spent grain for the clarification and flocculation of crude beer as a sustainable alternative to traditional flocculants, such as stabifix and bentonite.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Dhillon GS","Kaur S","Brar SK","Verma M"],"doi":"10.1021\/jf301747z","first_seen_on":"2012-12-18T11:28:28+00:00","issns":["0021-8561"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1355830099,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22866699?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22866699","pubdate":"2012-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Flocculation and Haze Removal from Crude Beer Using In-House Produced Laccase from Trametes versicolor Cultured on Brewer's Spent Grain.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/flocculation-haze-removal-crude-beer-using-inhouse-produced-laccase-trametes-versicolor-cultured-bre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628758,"mean":4.9386506288559,"rank":2016625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":937742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628758,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277741,"mean":5.7270514005904,"rank":148690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":79191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277741,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3308,"mean":4.5697060780163,"rank":1770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3308,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":3.6337608695652,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
