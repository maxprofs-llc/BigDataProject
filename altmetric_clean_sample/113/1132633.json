Recently, the E22\u0394 genetic missense mutation was detected in patients exhibiting Alzheimer's-disease type dementia. However, detailed knowledge about the E22\u0394 mutant-type A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 alloform structures as well as the differences from the wild-type A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 alloform structures is currently lacking. In this study, we present the structures of the E22\u0394 mutant-type A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 alloforms as well as the impact of E22\u0394 mutation on the wild-type A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 alloform structures. For this purpose, we performed extensive microsecond-time scale parallel tempering molecular dynamics simulations coupled with thermodynamic calculations. For studying the residual secondary structure component transition stabilities, we developed and applied a new theoretical strategy in our studies. We find that the E22\u0394 mutant-type A\u03b240 might have a higher tendency toward aggregation due to more abundant \u03b2-sheet formation in the C-terminal region in comparison to the E22\u0394 mutant-type A\u03b242 peptide. More abundant \u03b1-helix is formed in the mid-domain regions of the E22\u0394 mutant-type A\u03b2 alloforms rather than in their wild-type forms. The turn structure at Ala21-Ala30 of the wild-type A\u03b2, which has been linked to the aggregation process, is less abundant upon E22\u0394 mutation of both A\u03b2 alloforms. Intramolecular interactions between the N-terminal and central hydrophobic core (CHC), N- and C-terminal, and CHC and C-terminal regions are less abundant or disappear in the E22\u0394 mutant-type A\u03b2 alloform structures. The thermodynamic trends indicate that the wild-type A\u03b242 tends to aggregate more than the wild-type A\u03b240 peptide, which is in agreement with experiments. However, this trend is vice versa for the E22\u0394 mutant-type alloforms. The structural properties of the E22\u0394 mutant-type A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides reported herein may prove useful for the development of new drugs to block the formation of toxic E22\u0394 mutant-type oligomers by either stabilizing helical or destabilizing \u03b2-sheet structure in the C-terminal region of these two mutant alloforms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006812","authors":["Orkid Coskuner","Olivia Wise-Scira","George Perry","Taizo Kitahara"],"doi":"10.1021\/cn300149j","first_seen_on":"2012-12-19T06:19:59+00:00","issns":["1948-7193"],"journal":"ACS Chemical Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1497373212,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/cn300149j","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/cn300149j"],"pmid":"23421682","pubdate":"2012-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"121218144055004","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The Structures of the E22\u0394 Mutant-Type Amyloid-\u03b2 Alloforms and the Impact of E22\u0394 Mutation on the Structures of the Wild-Type Amyloid-\u03b2 Alloforms.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structures-e22-mutanttype-amyloid-alloforms-impact-e22-mutation-structures-wildtype-amyloid-alloform"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":4215281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3930082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298167,"mean":6.8630255897721,"rank":142068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":146232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298167,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":684,"mean":7.5283279648609,"rank":406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":684,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.2851538461538,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
