The antagonism of whole-cell currents in cultured rat cortical neurons by AR-R15896AR, ketamine, and memantine was examined. All three compounds produced a steady-state block after a 30-s coapplication, which was fully relieved after 50 s of NMDA exposure. The amplitudes of block caused by 50 microM AR-R15896AR, 10 microM ketamine, or 10 microM memantine were not significantly different, being 82 +\/- 1%, 80 +\/- 2%, and 81 +\/- 2%, respectively. All three NMDA receptor antagonists exhibited trapping of block that was not significantly increased by extending the agonist\/antagonist coapplication beyond 30 s. Although the initial blocks were similar, after 120 s of washout without agonist present, there were significant differences in trapping of block between antagonists, as only 54 +\/- 3% of the AR-R15896AR block, 86 +\/- 1% of the ketamine block, and 71 +\/- 4% of the memantine block remained trapped. The lack of complete trapping is consistent with closed-channel egress by these compounds. Higher antagonist concentrations produced larger initial blocks, but the degree of trapping block was not significantly different from that at lower antagonist concentrations. The results demonstrate that differences in the degree of trapping exist among use-dependent NMDA receptor antagonists even when on and off rates are similar. These differences are correlated with measures of therapeutic index.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de2","authors":["P. Morley","G. A. R. Mealing","T. H.
