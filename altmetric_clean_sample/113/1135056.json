We present a case of a 28-year-old man who presented to an outside institution with pleuritic chest pain after MMA vertebroplasty of the T11 thoracic vertebra for chronic back ache secondary to a previous traumatic fracture. Multifocal MMA pulmonary embolism was identified on CT. The patient was referred to our institution following a wedge resection for pulmonary infarction. V\/Q scintigraphy was performed and demonstrated normal ventilation with multiple mismatched perfusion defects bilaterally. Patient subsequently underwent central and bilateral segmental pulmonary embolectomies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Agrawal G","Wright CL","Rhodes NG","Sharma A"],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0b013e3182708548","first_seen_on":"2012-12-20T09:07:39+00:00","issns":["0363-9762"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1356994808,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23242048?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Abstract\/2013\/01000\/Mismatched_Perfusion_Defects_Secondary_to_Recent.13.aspx"],"pmid":"23242048","pubdate":"2012-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Mismatched Perfusion Defects Secondary to Recent Methyl Methacrylate Embolization","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mismatched-perfusion-defects-secondary-recent-methyl-methacrylate-embolization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2310568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1579903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282890,"mean":5.9246893304441,"rank":143625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":101362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282890,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1805,"mean":0.84696341463415,"rank":393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1805,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":1.3461538461538,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ClinNuclearMed\/statuses\/285883045012176897","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1135056],"posted_on":"2012-12-31T23:00:04+00:00","author":{"name":"ClinNucMed","url":"http:\/\/www.nuclearmed.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1593322340\/CNM_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine provides up-to-date information on nuclear medicine that can be readily applied to clinical situations.","id_on_source":"ClinNuclearMed","tweeter_id":"392964917","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":135},"tweet_id":"285883045012176897"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/statuses\/281687266311667714","license":"public","citation_ids":[1135056],"posted_on":"2012-12-20T09:07:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24774},"tweet_id":"281687266311667714"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Mismatched Perfusion Defects Secondary to Recent Methyl Meth... : Clinical Nuclear Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=395323597215456&id=283600854993937","citation_ids":[1135056],"posted_on":"2012-12-31T23:00:08+00:00","summary":"New Article:","author":{"name":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/283600854993937","facebook_wall_name":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/283600854993937\/picture","id_on_source":"283600854993937"}}]}}
