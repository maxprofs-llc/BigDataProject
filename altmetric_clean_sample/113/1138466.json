Two distinct but related crystal forms of SCR were obtained using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method and a reservoir solution consisting of 18%(w\/v) polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether and 8%(v\/v) 2-propanol as the precipitant. The crystals were rhomboid in shape with average dimensions of 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.4 mm and diffracted to a resolution of 2.7-3.0 A. The crystal forms both belong to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) and have unit-cell parameters a = 104.7, b = 142.8, c = 151.8 A and a = 101.1, b = 146.0, c = 159.8 A. The calculated values of V(M), rotation-function and translation-function solutions and consideration of potential crystal packing suggest that there are eight protein subunits per asymmetric unit.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037eb","authors":["Rongzhen Zhang","Yan Xu","Ying Sun","Yao Nie","Xiaoqing Mu","Xuemei Li","Xuejun C.
