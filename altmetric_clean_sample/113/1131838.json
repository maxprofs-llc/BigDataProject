However, several confounding factors including radiation-induced inflammation could not be easily avoided with the commonly used single-point FDG PET\/CT. Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of a dual-point PET\/CT protocol in LARC response prediction to CRT.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0b013e3182639a58","first_seen_on":"2012-12-18T20:46:33+00:00","issns":["0363-9762"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1369363502,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Abstract\/2013\/01000\/New_Application_of_Dual_Point_18F_FDG_PET_CT_in.2.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/2013\/01000\/New_Application_of_Dual_Point_18F_FDG_PET_CT_in.2.pdf","pmid":"23242038","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Department of Nuclear Medicine, and Center for Colorectal Cancer, Research Institute and Hospital, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of Korea.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"7","subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"New Application of Dual Point 18F-FDG PET\/CT in the Evaluation of Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Response of Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-application-dual-point-18ffdg-petct-evaluation-neoadjuvant-chemoradiation-response-locally-advan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":1990143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282442,"mean":5.9256417021608,"rank":115138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":158593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282442,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1805,"mean":0.84696341463415,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1805,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":1.3230769230769,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
