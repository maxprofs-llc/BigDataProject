However, the molecular mechanism by which CAPE affects oral cancer cell metastasis has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of CAPE on the invasive ability of SCC-9 oral cancer cells. Results showed that CAPE attenuated SCC-9 cell migration and invasion at noncytotoxic concentrations (0\u2009\u03bcM to 40\u2009\u03bcM). Western blot and gelatin zymography analysis findings further indicated that CAPE downregulated matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) protein expression and inhibited its enzymatic activity. CAPE exerted its inhibitory effects on MMP-2 expression and activity by upregulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and potently decreased migration by reducing focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and the activation of its downstream signaling molecules p38\/MAPK and JNK. These data indicate that CAPE could potentially be used as a chemoagent to prevent oral cancer metastasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Lin, Chiao-Wen"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/732578","first_seen_on":"2012-12-18T10:53:24+00:00","issns":["1741-427X"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1355827996,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2012\/732578\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2012\/732578.pdf","pmid":"23320037","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester Inhibits Oral Cancer Cell Metastasis by Regulating Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 and the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Pathway","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/caffeic-acid-phenethyl-ester-inhibits-oral-cancer-cell-metastasis-regulating-matrix-metalloproteinas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636263,"mean":4.9213309833055,"rank":2902859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636263,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277827,"mean":5.7093197252959,"rank":221264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277827,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2422,"mean":3.1567071458075,"rank":2125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2422,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":668,"mean":3.1018110944528,"rank":592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":668,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lstmjournals\/statuses\/280989100432056320","license":"public","citation_ids":[1130502],"posted_on":"2012-12-18T10:53:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Donald Mason Library","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_5_normal.png","description":"","id_on_source":"lstmjournals","tweeter_id":"109528074","followers":450},"tweet_id":"280989100432056320"}]}}
