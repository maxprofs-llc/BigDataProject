Explicit-Hydrogen Description of Substituted Benzenes and Polycyclic"],"citation":{"abstract":"The explicit-hydrogen version of the transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPE-EH) force field is extended to various substituted benzenes through the parametrization of the exocyclic groups -F, -Cl, -Br, -C\u2261N, and -OH and to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through the parametrization of the aromatic linker carbon atom for multiple rings. The linker carbon together with the TraPPE-EH parameters for aromatic heterocycles constitutes a force field for fused-ring heterocycles. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to compute vapor-liquid coexistence curves for fluorobenzene; chlorobenzene; bromobenzene; di-, tri-, and hexachlorobenzene isomers; 2-chlorofuran; 2-chlorothiophene; benzonitrile; phenol; dihydroxybenzene isomers; 1,4-benzoquinone; naphthalene; naphthalene-2-carbonitrile; naphthalen-2-ol; quinoline; benzo[b]thiophene; benzo[c]thiophene; benzoxazole; benzisoxazole; benzimidazole; benzothiazole; indole; isoindole; indazole; purine; anthracene; and phenanthrene. The agreement with the limited experimental data is very satisfactory, with saturated liquid densities and vapor pressures reproduced to within 1.5% and 15%, respectively. The mean unsigned percentage errors in the normal boiling points, critical temperatures, and critical densities are 0.9%, 1.2%, and 1.4%, respectively. Additional simulations were carried out for binary systems of benzene\/benzonitrile, benzene\/phenol, and naphthalene\/methanol to illustrate the transferability of the developed potentials to binary systems containing compounds of different polarity and hydrogen-bonding ability. A detailed analysis of the liquid-phase structures is provided for selected neat systems and binary mixtures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Neeraj Rai"],"doi":"10.1021\/jp307328x","first_seen_on":"2012-12-23T03:32:26+00:00","issns":["1520-6106"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1356233537,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jp307328x"],"pmid":"23205778","pubdate":"2012-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria. 10.
