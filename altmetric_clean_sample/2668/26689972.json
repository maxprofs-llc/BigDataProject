We assessed the diagnostic utility of skin surface temperature in differentiating cellulitis from pseudocellulitis. Adult patients presenting to the emergency department of a large urban hospital with presumed cellulitis were enrolled. Patients were randomized to dermatology consultation(n=40) versus standard of care(n=32). Thermal images of affected and unaffected skin were obtained for each patient. Analysis was performed on dermatology consultation patients to establish a predictive model for cellulitis, which was then validated in the other cohort. Of those evaluated by dermatology,28% were diagnosed with pseudocellulitis. Cellulitis patients had an average maximum affected skin temperature of 34.1\u00b0C,3.7\u00b0C higher than the corresponding unaffected area (95%CI:2.7-4.8\u00b0C,p<0.00001). Pseudocellulitis patients had an average maximum affected temperature of 31.5\u00b0C,0.2\u00b0C higher than the corresponding unaffected area(95%CI:-1.1-1.5\u00b0C,p=0.44). Temperature differences between sites were higher in cellulitis patients than in pseudocellulitis patients(3.7 vs. 0.2\u00b0C,p=0.002). A logistic regression model showed that a temperature difference of \u22650.47\u00b0C conferred a 96.6% sensitivity,45.5% specificity,82.4%PPV and 83.3% NPV for cellulitis diagnosis. When validated in the other cohort, this model correctly diagnosed 100% of patients with cellulitis, and 50% with pseudocellulitis. A difference threshold of \u22670.47\u00b0C between affected and unaffected skin demonstrated an 87.5% accuracy in cellulitis diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e0e","authors":["Lauren N.
