However, current techniques of intratracheal injection generally involve procedures that pose a risk of incident injury and infection for researchers, and may also cause collateral damage to experimental animals during the installation process. Here we describe an intratracheal injection method that was enabled by a three dimensional printing of a custom platform. This updated technique improved the overall ergonomics of intratracheal injection in mice, minimizing the risk of human injury and implementing the 3R (replacement, reduction and refinement) principle in mouse infection studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fca","authors":["Yong Cheng","Lucas D Liepert","Justin Waller","W Matthew Leevy","Jeff S Schorey"],"doi":"10.1177\/0023677216684422","first_seen_on":"2017-09-28T10:00:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0023-6772","1758-1117"],"issue":"5","journal":"Laboratory Animals","last_mentioned_on":1506606012,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28948897?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28948897"],"pmid":"28948897","pubdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["laboratoryanimalscience"],"title":"A novel method for intratracheal injection of infectious agents into mice","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-method-intratracheal-injection-infectious-agents-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0.5,"6d":0.5,"5d":0.5,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":6420810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1150617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113818,"mean":11.508109333404,"rank":79719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":21326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113818,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":355,"mean":3.1633050847458,"rank":278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":355,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MycobactPapers\/statuses\/913342561246498816","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26689622],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T10:00:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Mycobacterium Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/719097737984274432\/6xb8SSeZ_normal.jpg","description":"A daily collection of papers relating to Mycobacterium.
