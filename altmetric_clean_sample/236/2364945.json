Furthermore, these nanostructures show a unique pattern of structural combination, with Au nanoparticles positioned at the center of Bi2S3 nanorods. The chemistry of formation of these nanostructures, their epitaxy at the junction, and their photoconductance were studied, as well as their photoresponse properties.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Manna, Goutam","Bose, Riya","Pradhan, Narayan"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201402709","endpage":"6746","first_seen_on":"2014-05-20T12:58:36+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"26","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
