CCRs can be a potential reason for genomic imbalance in gametes, which leads to a drastic reduction in fertility. In this study, the meiotic segregation pattern, aneuploidy of seven chromosomes uninvolved in the CCR and chromatin integrity were analysed in the ejaculated spermatozoa of a 46,XY,t(6;10;11)(q25.1;q24.3;q23.1)mat carrier with asthenozoospermia and a lack of conception. The frequency of genetically unbalanced spermatozoa was 78.8% with a prevalence of 4:2 segregants of 38.2%, while the prevalence of the adjacent 3:3 mode was 35.3%. Analysis of the aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 15, 18, 21, 22, X and Y revealed an approximately fivefold increased level in comparison with that of the control group, indicating the presence of an interchromosomal effect. Sperm chromatin integrity status was evaluated using chromomycin A3 and aniline blue staining (deprotamination), acridine orange test and TUNEL assay (sperm DNA fragmentation). No differences were found when comparisons were made with a control group. We suggest that the accumulation of genetically unbalanced spermatozoa, significantly increased sperm aneuploidy level and decreased sperm motility (20%, progressive) were not responsible for the observed lack of reproductive success in the analysed infertile t(6;10;11) carrier. Interestingly, in the case described herein, a high level of sperm chromosomal imbalance appears not to be linked to sperm chromatin integrity status.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008738","authors":["Marta Olszewska","Nataliya Huleyuk","Monika Fraczek","Danuta Zastavna","Ewa Wiland","Maciej Kurpisz"],"doi":"10.1530\/rep-13-0533","first_seen_on":"2014-05-21T16:07:19+00:00","issns":["1741-7899"],"journal":"Reproduction","last_mentioned_on":1400688423,"links":["http:\/\/www.reproduction-online.org\/content\/147\/5\/659.abstract.html?etoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.reproduction-online.org\/content\/147\/5\/659.full.pdf","pmid":"24713394","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Sperm FISH and chromatin integrity in spermatozoa from a t(6;10;11) carrier","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sperm-fish-chromatin-integrity-spermatozoa-t61011-carrier"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3059136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938788,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105261,"mean":7.8306342010263,"rank":71009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":23591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105261,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":552,"mean":1.8589945553539,"rank":389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":552,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.85,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
