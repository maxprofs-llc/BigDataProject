This study uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Survey to estimate the extent to which paternal incarceration increases family material hardship. Analyses from a series of longitudinal regression models suggest that material hardship is statistically significant and positively associated with paternal incarceration. These hardships are found to reflect not only a reduction in fathers' income and financial contributions but also an increase in financial and other family strains. The findings underscore the challenges facing families with incarcerated fathers. They also emphasize the need for efforts by criminal justice agencies and social service providers to help mitigate the risks associated with paternal incarceration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001faa","authors":["Ofira Schwartz-Soicher","Amanda Geller","Irwin Garfinkel"," Ofira Schwartz-Soicher "," Amanda Geller "," Irwin Garfinkel "],"doi":"10.1086\/661925","endpage":"473","first_seen_on":"2014-05-19T17:35:23+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0037-7961","1537-5404"],"issue":"3","journal":"Social Service Review","last_mentioned_on":1402295962,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4020140\/?report=classic","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4020140\/table\/T1\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1086\/661925"],"pmcid":"PMC4020140","pmid":"24839314","pubdate":"2011-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"startpage":"447","title":"The Effect of Paternal Incarceration on Material Hardship","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-paternal-incarceration-material-hardship"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6832606,"mean":6.1894962021047,"rank":1025038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5804438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6832606,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169964,"mean":7.0526967987153,"rank":28292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":141542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169964,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":4.1990458715596,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
