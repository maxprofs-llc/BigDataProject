Our objective in this study was to determine whether plasma zinc concentration changes in response to consuming zinc-fortified foods or liquid zinc supplements. We conducted a 4-wk double-blind, randomized trial among 132 healthy Senegalese men \u2265 18 y. Participants received 1 of 4 interventions: 1) (control) 200 g\/d of wheat bread fortified with iron and folic acid, but not zinc, and a liquid multivitamin supplement without zinc between meals; 2) (zinc supplement) the same bread and the same multivitamin supplement with 15 mg zinc as ZnSO(4) added; 3) (moderate zinc fortification) the same bread cofortified with 7.5 mg zinc as ZnO and the same multivitamin supplement without zinc; or 4) (high zinc fortification) the same bread cofortified with 15 mg zinc as ZnO and the same multivitamin supplement without zinc. Fasting blood samples were collected twice at baseline and at d 15 and 29 of the intervention. There was no significant interaction between group and study day (P = 0.11). However, at d 15, the mean change in plasma zinc concentration in the zinc-supplemented group was greater than in the placebo and fortification groups ( 0.72 \u03bcmol\/L vs. -0.09 to 0.03 \u03bcmol\/L; P = 0.05). At d 29 there were no significant group-wise differences. Across all time points, the zinc-supplemented group was the only group where plasma zinc concentration increased from baseline (P = 0.006). These results suggest that plasma zinc concentration may not be a sufficiently sensitive indicator to evaluate short-term responses to zinc fortification.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Grant J.
