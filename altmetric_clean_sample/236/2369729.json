During spermiogenesis, round spermatid undergoes dramatic morphogenesis to give rise to mature spermatozoon, including the condensation and elongation of nucleus, development of acrosome, formation of flagellum, and removal of excessive cytoplasm. Although these transformations are well defined at the morphological level, the mechanisms underlying these intricate processes are largely unknown. Here, we report that Iqcg, which was previously characterized to be involved in a chromosome translocation of human leukemia, is highly expressed in the spermatogenesis of mice and localized to the manchette in developing spermatids. Iqcg knockout causes male infertility, due to severe defects of spermiogenesis and resultant total immobility of spermatozoa. The axoneme in the Iqcg knockout sperm flagellum is disorganized and hardly any typical (\"9+2\") pattern of microtubule arrangement could be found in Iqcg knockout spermatids. Iqcg interacts with calmodulin in a calcium dependent manner in the testis, suggesting that Iqcg may play a role through calcium signaling. Furthermore, cilia structures in the trachea and oviduct, as well as histological appearances of other major tissues, remain unchanged in the Iqcg knockout mice, suggesting that Iqcg is specifically required for spermiogenesis in mammals. These results might also provide new insights into the genetic causes of human infertility.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ren-Ke Li","Jue-Ling Tan","Li-Ting Chen","Jing-Sheng Feng","Wen-Xue Liang","Xue-Jiang Guo","Ping Liu","Zhu Chen","Jia-Hao Sha","Yi-Fei Wang","Sai-Juan Chen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0098053","first_seen_on":"2014-05-22T00:14:13+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1400839481,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0098053","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24849454?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0098053.pdf","pmid":"24849454","pubdate":"2014-05-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e98053","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Iqcg Is Essential for Sperm Flagellum Formation in Mice","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/iqcg-essential-sperm-flagellum-formation-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":2078703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2873743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122284,"mean":8.0122815599883,"rank":43169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":76747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122284,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88893,"mean":9.2571394951179,"rank":35879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":50705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88893,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3079,"mean":11.711610786225,"rank":1348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3079,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
