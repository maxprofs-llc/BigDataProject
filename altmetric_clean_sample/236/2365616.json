Brain slices have the advantage of maintaining the functional three-dimensional architecture of the neuronal network while also allowing researchers to obtain multiple sets of measurements from a single animal. In this work, we describe a simple, easy-to-fabricate perfusion device designed to focally deliver pharmacological agents to brain slices. The device incorporates a microfluidic channel that runs under the perfusion bath and a microcapillary that supplies fluid from this channel up to the slice. We measured electrically evoked DA release in brain slices before and after the administration of two dopaminergic stimulants, cocaine and GBR-12909. Measurements were collected at two locations, one directly over and the other 500 \u03bcm away from the capillary opening. Using this approach, the controlled delivery of drugs to a confined region of the brain slice and the application of this chamber to FSCV measurements, were demonstrated. Moreover, the consumption of drugs was reduced to tens of microliters, which is thousands of times less than traditional perfusion methods. We expect that this simply fabricated device will be useful in providing spatially resolved delivery of drugs with minimum consumption for voltammetric and electrophysiological studies of a variety of biological tissues both in vitro and ex vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Meng Sun"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac5008927","first_seen_on":"2014-05-20T16:31:59+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["0003-2700"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1400603508,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac5008927"],"pmid":"24734992","pubdate":"2014-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Localized Drug Application and Sub-Second Voltammetric Dopamine Release Measurements in a Brain Slice Perfusion Device","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/localized-drug-application-subsecond-voltammetric-dopamine-release-measurements-brain-slice-perfusio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":3098086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":973066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105592,"mean":7.7958298718642,"rank":72897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105592,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5069,"mean":2.372498421468,"rank":2674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5069,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":367,"mean":2.1981584699454,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":367,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
