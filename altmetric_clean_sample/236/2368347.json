Although almost all patients have an HLA-haploidentical family donor, prior attempts at transplantation from such donors using T-cell replete grafts and conventional immunosuppression were associated with unacceptable rates of GVHD, and when stringent ex vivo T-cell depletion was used to control GVHD, rates of graft rejection and post-transplant infections were prohibitive. The recent approach to HLA-haploidentical donor transplantation developed in Baltimore that uses T-cell replete grafts and post-transplant CY (Haplo-post-HCT-CY) to control post-transplant allo-reactivity appears to have overcome many of the obstacles historically associated with haploidentical donor transplantation. In particular, TRM rates of <10% are usual and rapid reconstitution of immunity leads to a low rate of post-transplant infections and no post-tranplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), consistent with the hypothesis that post-transplant CY selectively depletes proliferating alloreactive T cells responsible for GVHD and graft rejection while preserving resting memory T cells essential for post-transplant immunologic recovery. In parallel trials using similar non-myeloablative conditioning regimens, Haplo-post-HCT-CY produced similar overall survival to double umbilical cord blood transplantation(DUCBT) in adult patients (62% vs 54%), with low rates of TRM (7% vs 24%), severe acute GVHD (0% vs 21%) and chronic GVHD (13% vs 25%). Furthermore, recent non-randomized comparisons adjusted for risk factors show that Haplo-post-HCT-CY achieve at least equivalent outcomes to conventional MRD and MUD transplants. Although most experience has been obtained using BM, emerging data suggest that a G-CSF mobilized PBSC graft can also safely be used for Haplo-post-HCT-CY. Haplo-post-HCT-CY also avoids the graft acquisition costs of DUCBT and MUDs and the cost of cell selection associated with T-depleted grafts. Although randomized comparisons will be forthcoming, Haplo-post-HCT-CY can already be considered a valid standard-of-care in patients who lack conventional donors thus extending the availability of allogeneic transplants to almost all patients. This donor source may also challenge the routine preference for a MUD in patients lacking an MRD.Bone Marrow Transplantation advance online publication, 19 May 2014; doi:10.1038\/bmt.2014.62.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002414","authors":["A Bashey","S R Solomon"],"doi":"10.1038\/bmt.2014.62","first_seen_on":"2014-05-21T13:36:56+00:00","issns":["1476-5365","0268-3369"," 1476-5365"],"journal":"Bone Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1464183261,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24842530","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bmt\/journal\/v49\/n8\/full\/bmt201462a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bmt\/journal\/v49\/n8\/abs\/bmt201462a.html?WT.ec_id=BMT-201408"],"pmid":"24842530","pubdate":"2014-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"T-cell replete haploidentical donor transplantation using post-transplant CY: an emerging standard-of-care option for patients who lack an HLA-identical sibling donor","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tcell-replete-haploidentical-donor-transplantation-using-posttransplant-cy-emerging-standardofcare-o"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7757128,"mean":6.6329627680391,"rank":1796879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5941162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7757128,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173159,"mean":7.2830148303864,"rank":42402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":130136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173159,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1422,"mean":4.8277874736101,"rank":540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1422,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.5119230769231,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
