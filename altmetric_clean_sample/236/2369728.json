Although Rac1 recognized as a key player in the formation of lamellipodia, the molecular mechanisms underlying lamellipodial motility are not fully understood. Optogenetic technology enabled us to spatiotemporally control the activity of photoactivatable Rac1 (PA-Rac1) in living cells. Using this system, we revealed the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in Rac1-dependent lamellipodial motility in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Through local blue laser irradiation of PA-Rac1-expressing cells, lamellipodial motility was reversibly induced. First, outward extension of a lamellipodium parallel to the substratum was observed. The extended lamellipodium then showed ruffling activity at the periphery. Notably, PI(3,4,5)P3 and WAVE2 were localized in the extending lamellipodium in a PI3K-dependent manner. We confirmed that the inhibition of PI3K activity greatly suppressed lamellipodial extension, while the ruffling activity was less affected. These results suggest that Rac1-induced lamellipodial motility consists of two distinct activities, PI3K-dependent outward extension and PI3K-independent ruffling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Takuma Kato","Katsuhisa Kawai","Youhei Egami","Yoshiyuki Kakehi","Nobukazu Araki"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0097749","first_seen_on":"2014-05-22T00:13:29+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1400718902,"links":["http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0097749"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0097749.pdf","pmid":"24848679","pubdate":"2014-05-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e97749","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Rac1-Dependent Lamellipodial Motility in Prostate Cancer PC-3 Cells Revealed by Optogenetic Control of Rac1 Activity","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rac1dependent-lamellipodial-motility-prostate-cancer-pc3-cells-revealed-optogenetic-control-rac1-act"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3799733,"mean":5.0125028537806,"rank":2880111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":754252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3799733,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93852,"mean":7.5182772266678,"rank":70938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93852,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67409,"mean":8.2554076667458,"rank":48968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":14152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67409,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2868,"mean":10.829464248343,"rank":2372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2868,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
