These coefficients can be related to the Fick diffusion coefficients using the thermodynamic correction factor matrix, which requires to run several simulations to estimate all the elements of the matrix. In a recent work, Schnell et al. [\"Thermodynamics of small systems embedded in a reservoir: A detailed analysis of finite size effects,\" Mol. Phys. 110, 1069-1079 (2012)] developed an approach to determine the full matrix of thermodynamic factors from a single simulation in bulk. This approach relies on finite size effects of small systems on the density fluctuations. We present here an extension of their work for inhomogeneous Lennard Jones fluids confined in slit pores. We first verified this extension by cross validating the results obtained from this approach with the results obtained from the simulated adsorption isotherms, which allows to determine the thermodynamic factor in porous medium. We then studied the effects of the pore width (from 1 to 15 molecular sizes), of the solid-fluid interaction potential (Lennard Jones 9-3, hard wall potential) and of the reduced fluid density (from 0.1 to 0.7 at a reduced temperature T* = 2) on the thermodynamic factor. The deviation of the thermodynamic factor compared to its equivalent bulk value decreases when increasing the pore width and becomes insignificant for reduced pore width above 15. We also found that the thermodynamic factor is sensitive to the magnitude of the fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interactions, which softens or exacerbates the density fluctuations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Julien Collell","Julien Collell","Guillaume Galliero"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4875703","first_seen_on":"2014-05-20T14:23:05+00:00","issns":["1089-7690"],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1400595704,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/jcp\/140\/19\/10.1063\/1.4875703"],"pmid":"24852552","pubdate":"2014-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Determination of the thermodynamic correction factor of fluids confined in nano-metric slit pores from molecular simulation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determination-thermodynamic-correction-factor-fluids-confined-nanometric-slit-pores-molecular-simula"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":3097827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":973180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105592,"mean":7.7959899233837,"rank":72896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105592,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3787,"mean":2.0376867406233,"rank":1820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3787,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186,"mean":1.4375891891892,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
