These individuals may need 125\u2009\u03bcg of vitamin D3 to achieve desirable 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations to improve overall health. We evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 45 nursing home residents (28 women and 17 men, aged 58-89 years) with 25(OH)D concentrations <50\u2009nM who consumed daily one bun that had been fortified with 125\u2009\u03bcg vitamin D3. The Romanian version of Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41) was applied at baseline and after 12 months. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA). After one year supplementation, serum 25(OH)D reached optimal status (>75\u2009nM) and bone health has improved significantly. Nursing home residents who consumed daily bread fortified with 125\u2009\u03bcg vitamin D3 reported significant (P=.02 for the effect of time) improvement in HRQoL (total score of QUALEFFO-41). The interaction time x treatment was also statistically significant on pain (P=.04), daily activities (P=.02), and locomotion (P=.04). To ensure the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D recommended by medical groups for bone- and general-health in the older nursing residents, the practical experience shows that much higher amounts of vitamin D3 are required. Fortification of bread and cereals is a feasible way to improve vitamin D nutrition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e48","authors":["Costan AR","Vulpoi C","Mocanu V"],"doi":"10.1089\/jmf.2012.0210","first_seen_on":"2014-05-19T11:41:44+00:00","issns":["1096-620X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Food","last_mentioned_on":1433290857,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24827747","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/jmf.2012.0210","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/jmf.2012.0210"],"pmid":"24827747","pubdate":"2014-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["medicine","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Vitamin D Fortified Bread Improves Pain and Physical Function Domains of Quality of Life in Nursing Home Residents","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-fortified-bread-improves-pain-physical-function-domains-quality-life-nursing-home-resident"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8152765,"mean":6.9045738156959,"rank":3839110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4132310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8152765,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176781,"mean":7.4676139947961,"rank":70167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":101260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176781,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":831,"mean":9.1864385542169,"rank":372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":831,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":11.472235294118,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
