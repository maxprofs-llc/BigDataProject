Recent work supports the notion that parenteral vitamin C (VitC) is protective in sepsis through pleiotropic mechanisms. Whether suboptimal levels of circulating VitC increase susceptibility to sepsis-induced MODS is unknown. Materials and Methods: Unlike mice, humans lack the ability to synthesize VitC because of loss of L-gulono-\u03b3-lactone oxidase (Gulo), the final enzyme in the biosynthesis of VitC. To examine whether physiological levels of VitC are required for defense against a catastrophic infection, we induced sepsis in VitC sufficient and VitC deficient Gulo(-\/-) mice by intraperitoneal infusion of a fecal stem solution (FIP). Some VitC deficient Gulo(-\/-) mice received a parenteral infusion of ascorbic acid (AscA, 200 mg\/kg) 30 minutes after induction of FIP. We used molecular, histological, and biochemical analyses to assess for MODS as well as abnormalities in the coagulation system and circulating blood cells. Results: FIP produced injury to lungs, kidneys and liver (MODS) in VitC deficient Gulo(-\/-) mice. MODS was not evident in FIP-exposed VitC sufficient Gulo(-\/-) mice and attenuated in VitC deficient Gulo(-\/-) mice infused with AscA. Septic VitC deficient Gulo(-\/-) mice developed significant abnormalities in the coagulation system and circulating blood cells. These were attenuated by VitC sufficiency\/infusion in septic Gulo(-\/-) mice. Conclusions: VitC deficient Gulo(-\/-) mice were more susceptible to sepsis-induced MODS. VitC sufficiency or parenteral infusion of VitC, following induction of sepsis, normalized physiological functions that attenuated the development of MODS in sepsis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ae0","authors":["Bernard J.
