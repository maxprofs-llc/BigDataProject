The specific etiologic mechanisms resulting in the range of Class II dentoskeletal combinations observed are not yet understood. Most studies describing Class II phenotypic diversity have used moderate sample sizes or focused on younger patients who later in life might outgrow their Class II discrepancies; such a focus might also preclude the visualization of adult Class II features. The majority have used simple correlation methods resulting in phenotypes that might not be generalizable to different samples and thus might not be suitable for studies of malocclusion etiology. The purpose of this study was to address these knowledge gaps by capturing the maximum phenotypic variations in a large sample of white Class II subjects selected with strict eligibility criteria and rigorously standardized multivariate reduction analyses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005711","authors":["Moreno Uribe LM","Howe SC","Kummet C","Vela KC","Dawson DV","Southard TE"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajodo.2013.11.013","first_seen_on":"2014-05-21T14:26:14+00:00","funders":["phs"],"issns":["0889-5406"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopedics","last_mentioned_on":1400682378,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24582022","http:\/\/www.ajodo.org\/article\/PIIS0889540613010330\/abstract"],"pmid":"24582022","pubdate":"2014-03-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","orthodontics"],"title":"Phenotypic diversity in white adults with moderate to severe Class II malocclusion","type":"article","volume":"145","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phenotypic-diversity-white-adults-moderate-severe-class-ii-malocclusion-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3788531,"mean":4.9962599529773,"rank":1798978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1919753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3788531,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93560,"mean":7.4194719481825,"rank":39421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":52197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93560,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322,"mean":2.108199376947,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
