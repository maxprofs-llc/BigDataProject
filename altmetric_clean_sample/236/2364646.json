In order to test these propositions, age differences in reward-seeking and impulsivity were examined in a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse sample of 935 individuals between the ages of 10 and 30, using self-report and behavioral measures of each construct. Consistent with predictions, age differences in reward-seeking follow a curvilinear pattern, increasing between preadolescence and mid-adolescence, and declining thereafter. In contrast, age differences in impulsivity follow a linear pattern, with impulsivity declining steadily from age 10 on. Heightened vulnerability to risk-taking in middle adolescence may be due to the combination of relatively higher inclinations to seek rewards and still maturing capacities for self-control.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070f6","authors":["Steinberg, Laurence"],"doi":"10.1002\/dev.20445","endpage":"224","first_seen_on":"2014-05-20T11:12:42+00:00","issns":["1098-2302","0012-1630","10982302"],"issue":"3","journal":"Developmental Psychobiology","last_mentioned_on":1458495832,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/dev.20445\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/dev.20445"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/dev.20445\/pdf","pmid":"20213754","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"216","subjects":["psychophysiology","pediatrics"],"title":"A dual systems model of adolescent risk\u2010taking","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dual-systems-model-adolescent-risktaking"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7414256,"mean":6.4482247041637,"rank":3372123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3876003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7414256,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171477,"mean":7.1976261517649,"rank":66251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":99940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171477,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":551,"mean":4.7918181818182,"rank":271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":551,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.0888888888889,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":24,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":31,"Researcher":49,"Student  > Ph.
