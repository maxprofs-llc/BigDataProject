These reactive intermediates were found to readily undergo direct nucleophilic addition with a broad range of nucleophiles to produce various \u03b1,\u03b1'-disubstituted silyl enol ether structural motifs. The findings also highlight the significance of the solvent effect and residual water in enhancing the reaction rate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Joshua A.
