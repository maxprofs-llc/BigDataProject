Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with the pathogenesis of diverse autoimmune disorders and has similarly been implicated as a contributor to inflammatory bowel disease. In this review, we discuss animal, in vitro, genetic, and epidemiologic studies that have linked vitamin D deficiency with inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis or severity. Nonetheless, we present the caveat in interpreting these studies in the context of reverse causation: Does vitamin D deficiency lead to gastrointestinal disease, or does gastrointestinal disease (with related changes in dietary choices, intestinal absorption, nutritional status, lifestyle) lead to vitamin D deficiency?","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007055","authors":["Limketkai, Berkeley N","Bechtold, Matthew L","Nguyen, Douglas L"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11894-016-0526-9","first_seen_on":"2016-08-20T10:09:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-312X","1522-8037"],"issue":"10","journal":"Current Gastroenterology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1471687876,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27538982","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27538982?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27538982","pubdate":"2016-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Vitamin D and the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-pathogenesis-inflammatory-bowel-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":7136176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253814,"mean":12.278748346223,"rank":214267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253814,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269,"mean":4.1655373134328,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.578,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
