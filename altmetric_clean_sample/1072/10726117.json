A panel of 16 French organic bakers and farmer-bakers were selected for this work. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) diversity of their organic sourdoughs was investigated quantitatively and qualitatively combining (i) Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis-specific qPCR, (ii) global sequencing with MiSeq Illumina technology and (iii) molecular isolates identification. In addition, LAB and yeast enumeration, pH, Total Titratable Acidity, organic acids and bread specific volume were analyzed. Microbial and physico-chemical data were statistically treated by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Ascendant Classification (HAC). Total yeast counts were 6 log10 to 7.6 log10CFU\/g while LAB counts varied from 7.2 log10 to 9.6 log10CFU\/g. Values obtained by L. sanfranciscensis-specific qPCR were estimated between 7.2 and 10.3 log10CFU\/g, except for one sample at 4.4 log10CFU\/g. HAC and PCA clustered the sixteen sourdoughs into three classes described by their variables but without links to bakers' practices. L. sanfranciscensis was the dominant species in 13 of the 16 sourdoughs analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), by the culture dependent method this species was dominant only in only 10 samples. Based on isolates identification, LAB diversity was higher for 7 sourdoughs with the recovery of L. curvatus, L. brevis, L. heilongjiangensis, L.xiangfangensis, L. koreensis, L. pontis, Weissella sp. and Pediococcus pentosaceus, as the most representative species. L. koreensis, L. heilongjiangensis and L. xiangfangensis were identified in traditional Asian food and here for the first time as dominant in organic sourdough. This study highlighted that L. sanfranciscensis was not the major species in 6\/16 sourdough samples and that a relatively high LAB diversity can be observed in French organic sourdough.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4f","authors":["Michel, Elisa","Monfort, Clarisse","Deffrasnes, Marion","Guezenec, St\u00e9phane","Lhomme, Emilie","Barret, Matthieu","Sicard, Delphine","Dousset, Xavier","Onno, Bernard"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.07.034","first_seen_on":"2016-08-20T15:00:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-3460","01681605"],"journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1471705236,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27539249?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27539249","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Characterization of relative abundance of lactic acid bacteria species in French organic sourdough by cultural, qPCR and MiSeq high-throughput sequencing methods","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-relative-abundance-lactic-acid-bacteria-species-french-organic-sourdough-cultural-q"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":7136023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253815,"mean":12.278476183346,"rank":214185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253815,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1574,"mean":3.1087946598856,"rank":1184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1574,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":2.1421276595745,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
