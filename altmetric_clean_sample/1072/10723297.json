Consequntly, there are no large prospective studies of therapy and no uniform therapy recommendations. We analyzed data from 36 subjects receiving methotrexate alone (N = 27) or with prednisone (N = 9) as initial therapy. 31 subjects responded (86%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 73, 95%) with 8 complete responses and 23 partial responses. Median time-to-response was 3 months (range, 1-5 months). Median response duration was 20 months (range, 2-55 months). \u03b22-microoglobulin (\u03b22-MG) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) decreased significantly post-therapy (P < 0.0001). Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) was present in 18 subjects (50%) of our subjects and responded well to methotrexate. 26 subjects (72%) were tested for STAT3 mutation. 9 with a mutation had a median treatment-free survival of 5 months (range, 0.5-13 months), significantly briefer than that of 17 subjects without a STAT3 mutation (19 months, range, 3-97 months; P = 0.012; log-rank test). Methotrexate with or without prednisone is an effective initial therapy of persons with T-LGLL with wild-type STAT3.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Qiu, Zhi-Yuan","Fan, Lei","Wang, Rong","Gale, Robert Peter","Liang, Hua-Jin","Wang, Man","Wang, Li","Wu, Yu-Jie","Qiao, Chun","Chen, Yao-Yu","Xu, Wei","Qian, Jun","Li, Jian-Yong"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.11360","first_seen_on":"2016-08-20T10:14:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1471712952,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27542218?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27542218","pubdate":"2014-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Methotrexate therapy of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia impact of <i>STAT3<\/i> mutation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methotrexate-therapy-tcell-large-granular-lymphocytic-leukemia-impact-stat3-mutation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":6260099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1114619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253815,"mean":12.278427525668,"rank":180547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253815,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8793,"mean":3.1480818926297,"rank":4291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8793,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261,"mean":6.2284615384615,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
