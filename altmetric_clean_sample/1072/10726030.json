Remarkably it was this source of Ca(2+) (SOCE) rather than the apparent magnitude of the Ca(2+)-rise that conferred AC responsiveness. The molecular basis for this dependence is now resolved in the case of adenylyl cyclase 8 (AC8). Sensors for Ca(2+) and cAMP targeted to ACs have been particularly useful in dissecting the influences upon and composition of what turn out to be signalling microdomains centred on ACs. A number of physiological processes depend on the regulation by SOCE of ACs, but the issue is under-studied. Here I will expand on these topics and point to some immediate unresolved questions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e16","authors":["Cooper, Dermot M F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ceca.2015.04.004","endpage":"375","first_seen_on":"2016-08-20T14:49:27+00:00","issns":["1532-1991","01434160"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cell Calcium","last_mentioned_on":1471704552,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25978874?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25978874","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"368","subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"Store-operated Ca2+-entry and adenylyl cyclase","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/storeoperated-ca2entry-adenylyl-cyclase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":4385634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2296430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253815,"mean":12.278483866138,"rank":139640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":88576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253815,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317,"mean":1.9156518987342,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.41,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
