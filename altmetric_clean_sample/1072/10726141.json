Many different circumstances lead to the loss of immune tolerance and often the origin is suspected to be multifactorial. Recently, patients with autosomal recessive mutations in PRKCD encoding protein kinase c delta (PKC\u03b4) have been identified, representing a monogenic prototype for one of the most prominent forms of humoral systemic autoimmune diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PKC\u03b4 is a signaling kinase with multiple downstream target proteins and with functions in various signaling pathways. Interestingly, mouse models have indicated a special role of the ubiquitously expressed protein in the control of B-cell tolerance revealed by the severe autoimmunity in Prkcd (-\/-) knockout mice as the major phenotype. As such, the study of PKC\u03b4 deficiency in humans has tremendous potential in enhancing our knowledge on the mechanisms of B-cell tolerance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cfe","authors":["Salzer, Elisabeth","Santos-Valente, Elisangela","Keller, B\u00e4rbel","Warnatz, Klaus","Boztug, Kaan","Elisabeth Salzer","Elisangela Santos-Valente","B\u00e4rbel Keller","Klaus Warnatz","Kaan Boztug"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10875-016-0323-0","first_seen_on":"2016-08-20T15:03:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-2592","0271-9142"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1471705388,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27541826?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10875-016-0323-0?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10875-016-0323-0.pdf","pmid":"27541826","pubdate":"2016-08-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Protein Kinase C \u03b4: a Gatekeeper of Immune Homeostasis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-kinase-c-%CE%B4-gatekeeper-immune-homeostasis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":5966132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1990520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253814,"mean":12.278521604488,"rank":165470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":73262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253814,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":584,"mean":6.035704974271,"rank":282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":584,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":26.741666666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
