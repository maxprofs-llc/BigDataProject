However, comprehensive knowledge of which pathways are activated and deactivated by these essential sensors is largely unknown. To better understand the mechanism of GPCR signaling system, we integrated five independent genome-wide expression datasets, representing 275 human tissues and cell lines, with protein-protein interactions and functional pathway data.\nWe found that tissue-specificity plays a crucial part in the function of GPCR signaling system. Only a few GPCRs are expressed in each tissue, which are coupled by different combinations of G-proteins or \u03b2-arrestins to trigger specific downstream pathways. Based on this finding, we predicted the downstream pathways of GPCR in human tissues and validated our results with L1000 knockdown data. In total, we identified 154,988 connections between 294 GPCRs and 690 pathways in 240 tissues and cell types.\nThe source code and results supporting the conclusions of this article are available at http:\/\/tatonettilab.org\/resources\/GOTE\/source_code\/ CONTACT: nick.tatonetti@columbia.edu SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplemental information including 24 figures and 11 tables can be found with this article online.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Yun Hao","Nicholas P.
