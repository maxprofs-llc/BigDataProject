The analysis is able to be performed in 10\u00a0min and automated. The HSGC method used an ionic liquid (IL) based open tubular capillary gas chromatographic column to increase the ruggedness of this method and provide improved peak shapes for water. Due to the ionic liquids low vapor pressure, unique physiochemical properties, and high thermal stability, they also make idea solvents for HSGC. Unlike Karl Fischer titration methods, this HSGC method is not affected by side reactions. The developed method was shown to be broadly applicable. The water content in 12 different samples was found to range from 1%-7% water. The use of HSGC was highly sensitive and only required 10 mg of sample. In addition, it was found to have greater precision and accuracy than Karl Fischer titration and greater precision and speed than loss on drying.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040a0","authors":["Frink, Lillian A","Armstrong, Daniel
