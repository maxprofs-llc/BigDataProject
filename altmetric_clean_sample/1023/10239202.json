In this study, we evaluated the lignin (LIG), cellulose (CEL) and hemicellulose (HC) contents in maize using an association mapping panel that included 368 inbred lines in seven environments. A genome-wide association study using approximately 0.56 million SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 0.05 identified 22, 18 and 24 loci significantly associated with LIG, CEL and HC at P < 1.0\u00d710-4, respectively. The allelic variation of each significant association contributed 4 to 7% of the phenotypic variation. Candidate genes identified by GWAS mainly encode enzymes involved in cell wall metabolism, transcription factors, protein kinase and protein related to other biological processes. Among the association signals, six candidate genes had pleiotropic effects on lignin and cellulose content. These results provide valuable information for better understanding the genetic basis of stalk cell wall components in maize.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Kun Li","Hongwu Wang","Xiaojiao Hu","Zhifang Liu","Yujin Wu","Changling Huang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0158906","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T10:27:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1470220043,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0158906"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0158906.PDF","pmid":"27479588","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0158906","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals the Genetic Basis of Stalk Cell Wall Components in Maize","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-association-study-reveals-genetic-basis-stalk-cell-wall-components-maize-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":6197826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1097793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257660,"mean":11.998376885728,"rank":182860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257660,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113362,"mean":10.572639426258,"rank":82918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":17657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113362,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4365,"mean":10.415020164986,"rank":3411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4365,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
