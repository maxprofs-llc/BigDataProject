We analyzed antihypertensive use among patients with TRH (treated with \u22654 antihypertensive drugs concurrently) from July 2008 through December 2014 using Marketscan administrative data. We included adults aged 18 to 65 years, with \u22656 months of continuous enrollment, a hypertension diagnosis, and \u22651 episode of overlapping use of \u22654 antihypertensive drugs; patients with heart failure were excluded. We identified 411\u2009652 unique TRH episodes from 261\u2009652 patients with a mean age of 55.9 years. From 2008 to 2014, we observed an increased prevalence, among TRH episodes, of \u03b2-blockers (+6.8% [79% to 85.8%]) and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (+8.1% [69.1% to 77.2%]), and a decreased prevalence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (-12.5% [60.4% to 47.9%]) and nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists (-5.0% [15% to 10%]). The prevalence of most other classes changed by <5% from 2008 to 2014. Thiazide diuretic use was largely unchanged from 2008 to 2014, with hydrochlorothiazide being by far the most prevalent thiazide diuretic; chlorthalidone use increased only modestly (+2.6% [3.8% to 6.4%]). Aldosterone antagonist use increased only modestly (+2.9% [7.3% to 10.2%]). Use of optimal regimens increased steadily (+13.8% [50.8% to 64.6%]) during the study period, whereas combined angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\/angiotensin receptor blocker use declined (-11.4% [17.7% to 6.3%]). Our results highlight the persistent infrequent use of recommended therapies in TRH, including spironolactone and chlorthalidone, and suggest a need for better efforts to increase the use of such approaches in light of recent evidence demonstrating their efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007693","authors":["Andrew Y.
