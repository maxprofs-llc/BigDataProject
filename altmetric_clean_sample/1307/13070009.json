Melanin synthesis is regulated by melanogenic proteins such as tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1 and -2, and their transcription factors.\nIn this study, we assessed the effects of PQQ on melanogenic protein expression of murine B16 melanoma cells.\nWe assessed melanin production of PQQ-treated B16 melanoma cells. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of PQQ on the activity of melanogenic enzymes and their expression using Western blot and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses.\nIn the present study, PQQ inhibited melanin synthesis in cultured melanoma cells stimulated by either alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). To elucidate the mechanism of the effect of PQQ on melanogenesis, we performed Western blotting for melanogenic proteins, such as tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2. PQQ inhibited tyrosinase expression, however, it did not inhibit TRP-2 expression. Used as the stimulant for melanogenesis, both alpha-MSH and IBMX gave the same results for melanogenic protein expression. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the depigmentation effect of PQQ might be due to the inhibition of tyrosinase gene transcription but not the inhibition of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf).\nThis report indicates that PQQ is a possible anti-melanogenic agent and might be effective against hyperpigmentation disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4f","authors":["Sato, Kazuomi","Toriyama, Masaru"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jdermsci.2008.08.017","endpage":"145","first_seen_on":"2016-10-27T07:05:38+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0923-1811","09231811"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Dermatological Science","last_mentioned_on":1444924680,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19013771"],"pmid":"19013771","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"140","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Effect of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) on melanogenic protein expression in murine B16 melanoma","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-pyrroloquinoline-quinone-pqq-melanogenic-protein-expression-murine-b16-melanoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6497059,"mean":6.0162892730828,"rank":1142562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5327444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6497059,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87889,"mean":11.34736780903,"rank":20043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":67670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87889,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":372,"mean":2.9968086253369,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":372,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
