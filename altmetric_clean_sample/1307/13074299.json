HCC develops in a microenvironment enriched with extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) including Laminin (Ln)-332, produced by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Ln-332 is the ligand of \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24 integrins, differently expressed on HCC cell surface, that deliver intracellular pathways. Aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Ln-332 on sorafenib's effectiveness.\nHCC cells were challenged with Sorafenib in the presence of Ln-332 and of HSCs conditioned medium (CM).\nSorafenib impaired HCC cells proliferation and induced apoptosis. HSCs-CM or Ln-332 inhibited sorafenib's effectiveness in HCC cells expressing both \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24. Inhibiting \u03b13 but not \u03b16 integrin subunit using blocking-antibodies or siRNA abrogated the protection induced by Ln-332 and HSCs-CM. Hep3B cells expressing \u03b16\u03b24 but lacking the \u03b13 integrin were insensitive to Ln-332 and HSCs-CM protective effects. Hep3B \u03b13 positive, but not wild type and scramble transfected cells acquired protection by sorafenib when plated on Ln-332-CM or HSCs. Sorafenib dephosphorylated FAK and Erk1\/2 whereas Ln-332 and HSC-CM partially restored the pathways. Silencing FAK, but not Erk1\/2, abrogated the protection induced by Ln-332 and HSCs-CM, suggesting a specific role for FAK. Sorafenib downregulated total FAK, inducing its proteasomal degradation, while Ln-332 and HSCs-CM promoted the escape of FAK from ubiquitination, probably inducing a preferential membrane localization.\nThis study unveils a novel mechanism of sorafenib resistance depending on the \u03b13\u03b21\/Ln-332 axis and requiring FAK ubiquitination, providing new insights into personalizing therapy for patients with HCC.
