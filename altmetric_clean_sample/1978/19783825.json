Twenty-four adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to three groups (n\u00a0=\u00a08 per group): normal control group (NC), treadmill exercise group (TE) and treadmill exercise\u00a0+\u00a0LIPUS group (TE\u00a0+\u00a0LIPUS). The TE\u00a0+\u00a0LIPUS group received a LIPUS treatment (1\u00a0MHz, 30\u00a0mW\/cm(2)) at the gastrocnemius for 20\u00a0min\/d after treadmill exercise. The TE group was sham-treated. Eight weeks of treadmill training successfully established the exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy model. Muscle strength, muscle mass and muscle fiber cross-sectional area were significantly increased in the TE\u00a0+\u00a0LIPUS group compared with the TE group. Moreover, LIPUS treatment significantly upregulated the expression of Akt, mTOR, p-Akt and p-mTOR and significantly downregulated the expression of MSTN, ActRIIB, FoxO1 and its phosphorylation. The results indicated that LIPUS promotes exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy by facilitating protein synthesis and inhibiting the protein catabolism pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036d2","authors":["Liang Tang","Jing Zhang","Xinjuan Zhao","Nan Li","Wenqi Jian","Shuxin Sun","Jianzhong Guo","Lijun Sun","Dean Ta"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ultrasmedbio.2017.02.017","first_seen_on":"2017-05-02T14:24:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03015629","1879-291X"],"journal":"Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1493735073,"links":["http:\/\/www.umbjournal.org\/article\/S0301-5629(17)30097-2\/fulltext?rss=yes"],"pmid":"28461063","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound Promotes Exercise-Induced Muscle Hypertrophy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/original-contribution-1346"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161493,"mean":6.8965394462124,"rank":6203812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1094552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161493,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235448,"mean":12.575340802813,"rank":166390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235448,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":582,"mean":2.4061273666093,"rank":362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":582,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":2.312962962963,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sonocanada\/statuses\/859413304317366272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19783825],"posted_on":"2017-05-02T14:24:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Sonographers.ca","url":"http:\/\/www.sonographers.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/839605472697049088\/_uwSAqyd_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"sonocanada","tweeter_id":"3061719936","geo":{"lt":49.24966,"ln":-123.11934,"country":"CA"},"followers":152},"tweet_id":"859413304317366272"}]}}
