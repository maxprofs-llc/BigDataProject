Preschool children had speech and language, language-only, or speech-only disorders. Together with parent input, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) completed the CFCS at time 1. Parents and SLPs then independently completed a validated change-detecting functional communication outcome measure, the Focus on the outcomes of Communication Under Six (FOCUS), three times: at assessment (time 1), at the start of treatment (time 2), and at the end of treatment (time 3).\nThere was a significant negative correlation between CFCS classifications and FOCUS scores at all three measurement points for the ratings by both parents and SLPs (correlations ranged from -0.60 to -0.76). As expected, no correlations between CFCS classifications and FOCUS change scores were statistically significant.\nThis study provides evidence of construct and predictive validity of the CFCS, demonstrating its value as a discriminative tool for use with preschool children with a range of speech and language disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f3","authors":["Hidecker, Mary Jo Cooley","Cunningham, Barbara Jane","Thomas\u2010Stonell, Nancy","Oddson, Bruce","Rosenbaum, Peter"],"doi":"10.1111\/dmcn.13373","first_seen_on":"2017-05-02T11:45:46+00:00","issns":["00121622","1469-8749"],"journal":"Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1493907126,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dmcn.13373\/abstract?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dmcn.13373\/pdf","pmid":"28084630","pubdate":"2017-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Validity of the Communication Function Classification System for use with preschool children with communication disorders","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/validity-communication-function-classification-system-preschool-children-communication-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155745,"mean":6.9068271228166,"rank":4320957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2264029,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155745,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235891,"mean":12.594128135995,"rank":131172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235891,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1822,"mean":3.5929203734212,"rank":1171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1822,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":4.8084444444444,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
