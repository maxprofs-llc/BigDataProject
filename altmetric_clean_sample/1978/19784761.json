In this article, the influence of biochar on the cell growth and the potassium-solubilizing activity of Bacillus mucilaginosus AS1153 was examined. The impact on cell growth is related to the biochar-derived feedstocks and the particle size of biochar. Both intrinsic features and inner component fraction can promote the cell growth of B. mucilaginosus AS1153. The potassium-solubilizing activity was increased by 80% when B. mucilaginosus was incubated in conjunction with the biochar derived from corn stover. The survival time of B. mucilaginosus also was prolonged by adsorption in biochar. The experimental results suggested that the biochar containing B. mucilaginosus could be used as a potential biofertilizer to sustain crop production.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f6100011dd","authors":["Sainan Liu","Wenzhu Tang","Fan Yang","Jun Meng","Wenfu Chen","Xianzhen Li"],"doi":"10.1080\/10826068.2016.1155062","first_seen_on":"2017-05-02T15:03:06+00:00","issns":["1082-6068","1532-2297"],"journal":"Preparative Biochemistry and Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1493737373,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=26914283"],"pmid":"26914283","pubdate":"2017-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Influence of biochar application on potassium-solubilizing Bacillus mucilaginosus as potential biofertilizer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-biochar-application-potassiumsolubilizing-bacillus-mucilaginosus-potential-biofertilizer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161493,"mean":6.8965394462124,"rank":4098079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3856003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161493,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235449,"mean":12.575286967823,"rank":119149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":106189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235449,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":0.84307692307692,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.05,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
