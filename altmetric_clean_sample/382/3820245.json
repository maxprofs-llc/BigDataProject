Here, we introduce a temporally controlled reaction between cyclooctynes and 1,2-quinones, induced by facile oxidation of 1,2-catechols. This so-called strain-promoted oxidation-controlled cyclooctyne-1,2-quinone cycloaddition (SPOCQ) shows a remarkably high reaction rate when performed with bicyclononyne (BCN), outcompeting the well-known cycloaddition of azides and BCN by 3 orders of magnitude, thereby allowing a new level of orthogonality in protein conjugation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c4a","authors":["Annika Borrmann"],"doi":"10.1021\/bc500534d","first_seen_on":"2015-03-22T15:58:43+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1442670780,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/bc500534d","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/bc500534d"],"pmid":"25521043","pubdate":"2014-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Strain-Promoted Oxidation-Controlled Cyclooctyne\u20131,2-Quinone Cycloaddition (SPOCQ) for Fast and Activatable Protein Conjugation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strainpromoted-oxidationcontrolled-cyclooctyne12quinone-cycloaddition-spocq-fast-activatable-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6366423,"mean":5.8403468296642,"rank":1031903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5328773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6366423,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160329,"mean":10.250981700015,"rank":40607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":119511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160329,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":634,"mean":1.9622969984202,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":634,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.4614814814815,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
