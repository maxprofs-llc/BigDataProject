Growth failure may be due to a wide variety of mechanisms, either related to the growth hormone (GH)\/insulin-like growth factor axis or to underlying unknown pathologies. In this review, the relatively more frequently seen syndromes with short stature (Noonan syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Silver-Russell syndrome and Aarskog-Scott syndrome) were discussed. These disorders are associated with a number of endocrinopathies, as well as with developmental, systemic and behavioral issues. At present, GH therapy is used in most syndromic disorders, although long-term studies evaluating this treatment are insufficient and some controversies exist with regard to GH dose, optimal age to begin therapy and adverse effects. Before starting GH treatment, patients with syndromic disorders should be evaluated extensively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003fa0","authors":["Zeynep \u015e\u0131klar","Merih Berbero\u011flu"],"doi":"10.4274\/jcrpe.1149","first_seen_on":"2015-03-23T02:08:11+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1402929014,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3986733\/pdf\/JCRPE-6-1.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3986733\/"],"pmid":"24637303","pubdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The National Pediatric Association -Turkey","startpage":"1","title":"Syndromic Disorders with Short Stature","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/syndromic-disorders-short-stature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3935348,"mean":5.011877098614,"rank":3138992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":96298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3935348,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117214,"mean":9.9236048835009,"rank":99675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117214,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":3.8842857142857,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
