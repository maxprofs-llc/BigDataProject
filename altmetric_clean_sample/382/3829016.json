{"altmetric_id":3829016,"citation":{"abstract":"The development objective of the Chongqing Small Towns Water Environment Management Project for China is to reduce flood risks and improve wastewater services in selected counties of the Chongqing Municipality. Negative impacts include: dust, air quality, noise pollution, water quality, waste management, asbestos management, noise pollution, soil erosion, and loss of ecology. Mitigation measures include: during the storage and loading, the materials should be covered; water spray should be provided at each construction site per day; trucks transporting earth and solid waste should be covered; construction sites should be enclosed; Management of construction machinery should be strengthened. Such situations as escaping, running-out, dripping and leaking should be avoided as much as possible; treatment facilities including permanent car washing station, oil trap and grit chamber and so on should be provided, so that oily wastewater can be reused after treatment in the oil trap and grit chamber; management of transport vehicle: cement, aggregate and other similar materials would easily generate dust nuisance. For transportation of materials that would easily scatter and leak, they must be loaded based on normative procedures. Closed transporter should be intact, neat and clean. Overloading is strictly prohibited; and topsoil should be removed and stockpiled in a flat area with temporary retaining wall surrounded with ditches and sedimentation tank. The stockpile should be covered. The topsoil will be used for ecological restoration of the works.","authors":["The World Bank"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T12:19:13+00:00","issns":[],"last_mentioned_on":1409282108,"links":["http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2014\/05\/19613072\/china-chongqing-small-towns-water-environment-management-project-environmental-assessment-vol-2-3-executive-summary"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www-wds.worldbank.org\/external\/default\/WDSContentServer\/WDSP\/IB\/2014\/06\/04\/000333037_20140604100240\/Rendered\/PDF\/E45120V20REVIS00Box385237B00PUBLIC0.pdf","pubdate":"2014-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Executive summary","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/19613072"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"counts":{"total":{"posts_count":1},"twitter":{"unique_users_count":1,"unique_users":["noworldbank"],"posts_count":1}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/noworldbank\/status\/505191893714468864","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3829016],"posted_on":"2014-08-29T03:15:08+00:00","author":{"name":"noworldbank","url":"http:\/\/www.noworldbank.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1405956351\/wbxredlogofin_copy_normal.png","description":"#Occupy and Say NO to the #WorldBank http:\/\/www.noworldbank.com #OpESR #OccupyWB #OccupyIMF #Anonymous #Activism #HumanRights #Grassroots","id_on_source":"noworldbank","tweeter_id":"294131075","geo":{"lt":"31.9524685","ln":"-102.1732905","country":"US"},"followers":891},"tweet_id":"505191893714468864"}]}}
