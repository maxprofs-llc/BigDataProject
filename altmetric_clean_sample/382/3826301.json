A 215-amino acid fragment of GFP (S1-10) was expressed in the cytoplasm as a free protein or fused to the N-terminus of calnexin and in the ER as an intraluminal protein or fused to the C-terminus of calnexin. A 16-amino acid fragment of GFP (S11) was fused to the N- or C-terminus of the target protein. Fluorescence occurred when both GFP fragments were in the same intracellular compartment. After validation with the cellular proteins PDI and tapasin, we investigated two vaccinia virus proteins (L2 and A30.5) of unknown topology that localize to the ER and are required for assembly of the viral membrane. Our results indicated that the N- and C-termini of L2 faced the cytoplasmic and luminal sides of the ER, respectively. In contrast both the N- and C-termini of A30.5 faced the cytoplasm. The system offers advantages for quickly determining the topology of intracellular proteins: the S11 tag is similar in length to commonly used epitope tags; multiple options are available for detecting fluorescence in live or fixed cells; transfection protocols are adaptable to numerous expression systems and can enable high throughput applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367f","authors":["Hyun, Seong\u2010In","Maruri\u2010Avidal, Liliana","Moss, Bernard"],"doi":"10.1111\/tra.12281","endpage":"795","first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T05:21:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-0854","1398-9219"],"issue":"7","journal":"Traffic","last_mentioned_on":1427174443,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tra.12281\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tra.12281\/pdf","pmid":"25761760","pubdate":"2015-04-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons A\/S","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"787","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Topology of Endoplasmic Reticulum\u2010Associated Cellular and Viral Proteins Determined with Split\u2010GFP","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/topology-endoplasmic-reticulumassociated-cellular-viral-proteins-determined-splitgfp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6397495,"mean":5.9827762414467,"rank":4727826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":948861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6397495,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166964,"mean":9.9730769212341,"rank":119600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":28409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166964,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":587,"mean":1.9032935153584,"rank":417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":587,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.1566666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
