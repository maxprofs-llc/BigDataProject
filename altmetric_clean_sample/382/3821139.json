A total of 65 compounds with different antioxidant capacity, phenolic substance content and antibacterial properties were detected with 14 plant essential oils. The best-fit M(N)LR models indicated that relative to anise essential oil, the essential oils of oreganos, cinnamon, and thyme had consistently high inhibitory effects, while orange peel essential oil had consistently a low inhibitory effect. Regression analysis indicated that beta-bisabolene (Turkish and Istanbul oreganos), and terpinolene (thyme) were found to be the most inhibitory compounds regardless of the bacteria type tested.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4f","authors":["Akdemir Evrendilek G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.02.030","first_seen_on":"2015-03-23T00:42:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1431020878,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25764982","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25764982\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.02.030"],"pmid":"25764982","pubdate":"2015-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Empirical prediction and validation of antibacterial inhibitory effects of various plant essential oils on common pathogenic bacteria.","type":"article","volume":"202","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/empirical-prediction-validation-antibacterial-inhibitory-effects-various-plant-essential-oils-common"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5067557,"mean":6.0017196092174,"rank":2500103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2414839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5067557,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148875,"mean":10.307626946277,"rank":77692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":64815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148875,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1056,"mean":2.3282843601896,"rank":469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1056,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":0.89615384615385,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
