Of these lignans tested, compounds 1, 7, 8 and 13 exhibited noteworthy antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 92, 115, 35 and 48 \u03bcg\/mL, respectively. The anti-oxidative haemolysis of human red blood cells (RBCs) activity of the most active compound 8, which is similar to that of vitamin C, was evaluated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028df","authors":["Kan Jiang","Qiu-Yan Song","Shou-Jiao Peng","Qian-Qian Zhao","Guang-Da Li","Ya Li","Kun Gao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fitote.2015.03.015","first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T02:44:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-6971"],"journal":"Fitoterapia","last_mentioned_on":1442660558,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25796351?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25796351?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25796351","pubdate":"2015-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"New lignans from the roots of Schisandra sphenanthera.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-lignans-roots-schisandra-sphenanthera"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6364170,"mean":5.8381808864598,"rank":5421873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6364170,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160276,"mean":10.260597984714,"rank":133570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160276,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":436,"mean":2.1007770114943,"rank":264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":436,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.1625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
