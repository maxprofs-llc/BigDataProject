To guide the empirical work, this paper develops a general equilibrium model that underscores the role of reallocation of family labor engaged in the production of non-marketed services at home (`home production'). The model predicts positive effects of a favorable agricultural productivity shock on wages and income, but the effect on hired labor is ambiguous; it depends on the strength of reallocation of labor from home to market production by labor surplus and deficit households. Taking rainfall variations as a measure of shock to agricultural productivity, and using subdistrict level panel data from Bangladesh, this paper finds significant positive effects of a favorable rainfall shock on agricultural wages, labor supply to market work, and per capita household expenditure. The share of hired labor in contrast declines substantially in response to a favorable productivity shock, which is consistent with a case where labor-deficit households respond more than the labor-surplus ones in reallocating labor from home production.","authors":["Emran, Shahe","Shilpi, Forhad","Shahe Emran","Forhad Shilpi"],"doi":"10.1596\/1813-9450-7056","first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T11:54:00+00:00","handle":"10986\/20518","handles":["10986\/20518"],"issns":["1813-9450"],"last_mentioned_on":1417070748,"links":["http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2014\/10\/20270087\/agricultural-productivity-hired-labor-wages-poverty-evidence-bangladesh?hootPostID=48903b154fa6dfa332a378163e1da58a","http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2014\/10\/20270087\/agricultural-productivity-hired-labor-wages-poverty-evidence-bangladesh?cid=DEC_ResearchHighlightsEN_M_INT","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10986\/20518"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www-wds.worldbank.org\/external\/default\/WDSContentServer\/WDSP\/IB\/2014\/10\/07\/000158349_20141007155814\/Rendered\/PDF\/WPS7056.pdf","pubdate":"2014-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The World Bank","startpage":"1","title":"Agricultural productivity, hired labor, wages and poverty : evidence from Bangladesh","type":"book","uri":"http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/20270087"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"NL":2,"ZA":1,"FI":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/greenvideos\/status\/521568932793450496","license":"datasift","rt":["cgiarclimate"],"citation_ids":[3828172],"posted_on":"2014-10-13T07:51:38+00:00","author":{"name":"OrganicGardening","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/800157492860911617\/wgLanges_normal.jpg","description":"#NoGMO #sustainability #nurture #foods this earth is the only earth we have","id_on_source":"greenvideos","tweeter_id":"2161477598","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2012},"tweet_id":"521568932793450496"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WB_Agriculture\/status\/520666408381071360","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3828172],"posted_on":"2014-10-10T20:05:19+00:00","author":{"name":"WBG Agriculture","url":"http:\/\/worldbank.org\/agriculture","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/785551805929455617\/mECZeqmB_normal.jpg","description":"The World Bank works with developing countries on agriculture to improve global food security and livelihoods for millions of rural poor.","id_on_source":"WB_Agriculture","tweeter_id":"233606438","geo":{"lt":38.91706,"ln":-77.00025,"country":"US"},"followers":26102},"tweet_id":"520666408381071360"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cgiarclimate\/status\/521568580526415872","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3828172],"posted_on":"2014-10-13T07:50:14+00:00","author":{"name":"CCAFS cgiarclimate","url":"http:\/\/www.ccafs.cgiar.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1157315493\/CCAFS_logo_imageonly_normal.jpg","description":"CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture & Food Security (CCAFS) seeks to overcome the threats to agriculture & food security in a changing climate","id_on_source":"cgiarclimate","tweeter_id":"57341938","geo":{"lt":51.97,"ln":5.66667,"country":"NL"},"followers":43565},"tweet_id":"521568580526415872"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AfricaGreenMedi\/status\/521568634037370881","license":"datasift","rt":["cgiarclimate"],"citation_ids":[3828172],"posted_on":"2014-10-13T07:50:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Africa Green Media","url":"http:\/\/africagreenmedia.co.za","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/433614972644380672\/VwTLgZbP_normal.png","description":"Africa Green Media is a media company that aims to focus on issues such as environmental, energy, food security pollution, climate change, water & agriculture","id_on_source":"AfricaGreenMedi","tweeter_id":"1327504387","geo":{"lt":-29,"ln":24,"country":"ZA"},"followers":5701},"tweet_id":"521568634037370881"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TonysAngle\/status\/537859818409955328","license":"datasift","rt":["LeenBoer"],"citation_ids":[3828172],"posted_on":"2014-11-27T06:45:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Tony Addison","url":"http:\/\/www.wider.unu.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/846078643482902532\/vEnuOSqy_normal.jpg","description":"Chief Economist @UNUWIDER, but otherwise human.
