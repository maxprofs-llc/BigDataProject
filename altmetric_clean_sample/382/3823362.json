The tectal neurons that comprise the optic tectum are organized into layers. These neurons project their dendrites laterally into the neuropil where visual inputs target the distal region of the dendrite and nonvisual inputs target the proximal region of the same dendrite. The Xenopus tadpole tectum is a popular model to study the development of sensory circuits. However, whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiological studies of the tadpole tectum (using the whole brain or in vivo preparations) have focused solely on the deep-layer tectal neurons because only neurons of the deep layer are visible and accessible for whole cell electrophysiological recordings. As a result, whereas the development and plasticity of these deep-layer neurons has been well-studied, essentially nothing has been reported about the electrophysiology of neurons residing beyond this layer. Hence, there exists a large gap in our understanding about the functional development of the amphibian tectum as a whole. To remedy this, we developed a novel isolated brain preparation that allows visualizing and recording from all layers of the tectum. We refer to this preparation as the \"horizontal brain slice preparation.\" Here, we describe the preparation method and illustrate how it can be used to characterize the electrophysiology of neurons across all of the layers of the tectum as well as the spatial pattern of synaptic input from the different sensory modalities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e78","authors":["Ali S.
