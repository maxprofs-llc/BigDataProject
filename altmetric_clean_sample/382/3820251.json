To determine the presence of hypothyroidism at birth we conducted a retrospective study in our cohort of patients presenting with either PHP1A (n = 116) or PHP1B (n = 99). We also investigated patients presenting at birth with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and a eutopic thyroid gland for phosphocalcium abnormalities suggesting PTH resistance and PHP. Our study reveals CH as the earliest diagnostic clue for PHP1A, but not for PHP1B. We estimated the frequency of CH at birth to be between 8 and 34% in patients presenting with PHP1A. The elevation of phosphatemia and PTH concentration precedes hypocalcemia in PHP1A. Conversely, the frequency of PHP1A in patients presenting CH is dramatically low. This may be due to the low prevalence of PHP1A which remains unknown.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029fd","authors":["Picard C","Decrequy A","Guenet D","Bursztejn AC","Toledano D","Richard N","Kottler ML"],"doi":"10.1159\/000369492","first_seen_on":"2015-03-22T15:59:43+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Hormone Research in Paediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1421509094,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25591844\/"],"pmid":"25591844","pubdate":"2015-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology","pediatrics"],"title":"Diagnosis and Management of Congenital Hypothyroidism Associated with Pseudohypoparathyroidism.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnosis-management-congenital-hypothyroidism-associated-pseudohypoparathyroidism-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4744682,"mean":5.4880204995978,"rank":3866361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4744682,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138113,"mean":10.369376766682,"rank":115092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138113,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186,"mean":2.0930594594595,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.1607142857143,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
