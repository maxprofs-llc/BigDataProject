These proteins, whose secondary structures are predominantly alpha-helical segments, and many peptides form pores in membranes without a crystallizable protein assembly, contrary to the family of beta-pore-forming proteins, which form crystallizable beta-barrel pores. Nevertheless, a protein-induced pore in membranes is commonly assumed to be a protein channel. Here, we show a type of peptide-induced pore that is not framed by a peptide structure. Peptide-induced pores in multiple bilayers were long-range correlated into a periodically ordered lattice and analyzed by X-ray diffraction. We found the pores induced by Bax-derived helical peptides were at least partially framed by a lipid monolayer. Evidence suggests that the formation of such lipidic pores is a major mechanism for alpha-pore-forming proteins, including apoptosis-regulator Bax.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2008PNAS..10517379Q","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Shuo Qian","Wangchen Wang","Lin Yang","Huey W.
