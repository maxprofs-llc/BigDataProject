{"altmetric_id":3828966,"citation":{"abstract":"The majority of Northeast Brazil falls within the semi-arid zone, an area that is defined by both a minimal amount of annual rainfall (i.e., 800 millimeters per year on average) and a concentration of that rainfall during only a few months per year. The Northeast also has a significant susceptibility to extreme drought events. Recent World Bank-supported studies indicate that climate change, combined with increasing population and water demand, could affect water systems in the region (World Bank, 2012, 2013). Figure 1 shows the nine Northeast states and the general outline of the semi-arid region. The most recent drought, a multi-year event that has plagued the Northeast more or less since 2010, has been the most severe in decades. In Figure 2, the histogram to the right indicates the average rainfall and its monthly distribution from January to December for the Northeast state of Cear\u00e1. The histograms to the left indicate the wet years of 2008 and 2009, followed by the roughly average year of 2011, and then the subsequent strong drought years of 2012, 2013, and 2014 (until April).","authors":["The World Bank"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T12:18:00+00:00","issns":[],"last_mentioned_on":1410612123,"links":["http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2014\/05\/20192702\/living-semi-arid-proactive-drought-management-northeast-brazil-new-perspective"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www-wds.worldbank.org\/external\/default\/WDSContentServer\/WDSP\/IB\/2014\/09\/10\/000470435_20140910135247\/Rendered\/PDF\/905270WP0O10000ox385319Bl00PUBLIC00.pdf","pubdate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Living with the semi-arid and proactive drought management in Northeast Brazil : a new perspective","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/20192702"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BS":1,"US":1}}},"counts":{"total":{"posts_count":2},"twitter":{"unique_users_count":2,"unique_users":["jhermanns_josef","noworldbank"],"posts_count":2}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jhermanns_josef\/status\/510770382169972736","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3828966],"posted_on":"2014-09-13T12:42:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Josef Hermanns","url":"http:\/\/hermann-josefhermanns.com\/","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000026682532\/ab56b2a687b117e53f26f7ffb80f18ca_normal.jpeg","description":"Hermann-Josef Hermanns serves as Honorary Consul for Federal Republic of Germany in the Bahamas.
