Patients are frequently admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for severe sepsis or septic shock. Empirical antibiotic treatment, including monotherapy \u03b2-lactam covering Pseudomonas aeruginosa, must be prompt. The ICU management is slightly different, due to a particular microbial ecology. A standardized approach to obtain a microbiological documentation is the cornerstone in these patients, leading to an adapted antimicrobial treatment. Systematic reassessment of initial antibiotic regimen should be realised. Neutropenic patients with severe sepsis or septic shock should receive promptly a \u03b2-lactam-aminoglycoside combination, as well as glycopeptides in case of severity or absence of documented infection. Early catheter removal should be considered widely. In the actual context of growing resistance, antibiotics saving became a major concern. According to context and microbial documentation, an escalade or de-escalade approach is recommended, to take into account multi-resistant pathogens. The addition of antifugal treatment is also a major issue in these patients and has well-defined indications. In neutropenic patients admitted in the ICU for severe sepsis or septic shock, controlling local microbial epidemiology and the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria are the key issues.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006d43","authors":["Colombe Saillard","Antoine Sannini","Laurent Chow-Chine","Jean-Louis Blache","Jean-Paul Brun","Djamel Mokart"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bulcan.2014.11.003","first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T10:31:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1769-6917"],"journal":"Bulletin du Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1427791398,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25799163?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25799163?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25799163","pubdate":"2015-03-19T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"[Febrile neutropenia in onco-hematology patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Unit].","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prise-en-charge-la-neutrop%C3%A9nie-f%C3%A9brile-chez-le-patient-doncoh%C3%A9matologie-admis-en-r%C3%A9animation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4941208,"mean":5.861952756079,"rank":2042855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2815583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4941208,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146254,"mean":10.300433618456,"rank":61501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":81575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146254,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":1.4473288590604,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.71428571428571,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/status\/580315665749266432","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3827287],"posted_on":"2015-03-24T10:30:11+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
