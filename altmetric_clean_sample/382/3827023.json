Of particular concern is the use of phthalates in the production of flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products. Di-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP) is a commonly used phthalate ester plasticizer that imparts flexibility and elasticity to PVC products. Recent epidemiological studies have reported correlations between urinary phthalate concentrations and cardiovascular disease, including an increased risk of high blood pressure and coronary risk. Yet, there is little direct evidence linking phthalate exposure to adverse effects in human cells, including cardiomyocytes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Nikki Gillum Posnack","Rabia Idrees","Hao Ding","Rafael Jaimes Iii","Gulnaz Stybayeva","Zaruhi Karabekian","Michael A Laflamme","Narine Sarvazyan","Posnack NG","Idrees R","Ding H","Jaimes Iii R","Stybayeva G","Karabekian Z","Laflamme MA","Sarvazyan N"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0121927","first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T10:05:18+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1461336610,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25799571?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0121927","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25799571?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"25799571","pubdate":"2015-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Exposure to Phthalates Affects Calcium Handling and Intercellular Connectivity of Human Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exposure-phthalates-affects-calcium-handling-intercellular-connectivity-human-stem-cellderived-cardi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":3471221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3945952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198396,"mean":9.2160611809775,"rank":88853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":102837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198396,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108156,"mean":10.222712662383,"rank":51487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":52238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108156,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4703,"mean":10.04391620587,"rank":2390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":2093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4703,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
