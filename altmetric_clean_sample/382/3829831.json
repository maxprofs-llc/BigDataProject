{"altmetric_id":3829831,"citation":{"abstract":"The Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project (DVRP) for Saint Lucia seeks to measurably reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change impacts in the country through urgent risk mitigation measures and by strengthening its capacity to understand and manage disaster risks. Environmental impacts for the project are expected to be moderate in nature and can be managed through the application of appropriate engineering and management measures. This document describes the environmental impacts of the project on a program wide level, and also serves as an appropriate environmental management tool to be used for future subprojects. Potential negative impacts identified include increased traffic and potential for traffic conflict, increased vibration and noise levels, poor solid and liquid waste management, deforestation and loss of habitats, air pollution, marine pollution and impacts on marine habitats, terrestrial pollution, soil erosion and land slippage, occupational health and safety issues, and loss of or damage to historical or cultural artefacts. Appropriate and detailed mitigation measures have also been suggested to minimize or avoid the effects of these adversities.","authors":["The World Bank"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T12:39:51+00:00","issns":[],"last_mentioned_on":1389779023,"links":["http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2013\/12\/18800725\/saint-lucia-disaster-vulnerability-reduction-project-dvrp-environmental-assessment-environmental-management-framework"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www-wds.worldbank.org\/external\/default\/WDSContentServer\/WDSP\/IB\/2014\/01\/15\/000461832_20140115121806\/Rendered\/PDF\/E44060LCR0EMP000Box382119B00PUBLIC0.pdf","pubdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Environmental assessment and environmental management framework","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/18800725"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"counts":{"total":{"posts_count":1},"twitter":{"unique_users_count":1,"unique_users":["leobobadilla"],"posts_count":1}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/leobobadilla\/status\/423390029831237632","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3829831],"posted_on":"2014-01-15T09:43:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Leonel Bobadilla B","url":"https:\/\/www.vizify.com\/francisco-leonel-bobadilla-bolivar","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1531538992\/Bobadilla_2_normal.png","description":"Docente y economista cl\u00e1sico.","id_on_source":"leobobadilla","tweeter_id":"111728160","geo":{"lt":17.98689,"ln":-92.93028,"country":"MX"},"followers":1523},"tweet_id":"423390029831237632"}]}}
