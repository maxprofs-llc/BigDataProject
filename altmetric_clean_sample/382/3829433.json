{"altmetric_id":3829433,"citation":{"abstract":"Ratings for the Grenada Skills for Inclusive Growth Project were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: all government-sponsored internship programs operating in Grenada should have consistent sets of incentives. As originally conceive, internships under the project required employers to pay for the stipend. This requirement, together with the fact that it targeted less educated, unemployed youth, obviously put the project at a disadvantage with respect to other publicly sponsored internship programs, such as the one from the community college, which seeks to place college-educated trainees in internships at no cost to employers. There are opportunities to eliminate duplications and ensure the most effective and efficient use of the country's limited institutional and technical resources. For example, career counseling under skills development programs could be strengthened by utilizing the already installed capacity within the Ministry of Education, or MoE and individual schools. Likewise, performance under the project by individual training providers could be used as selection criteria under other skills development projects.","authors":["The World Bank"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T12:29:32+00:00","issns":[],"last_mentioned_on":1394617684,"links":["http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2014\/02\/19231954\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www-wds.worldbank.org\/external\/default\/WDSContentServer\/WDSP\/IB\/2014\/03\/12\/000333037_20140312124311\/Rendered\/PDF\/ICR28720P095680C0disclosed030100140.pdf","pubdate":"2014-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"OECS Countries - (Grenada) Skills for Inclusive Growth Project","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/19231954"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"counts":{"total":{"posts_count":1},"twitter":{"unique_users_count":1,"unique_users":["leobobadilla"],"posts_count":1}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/leobobadilla\/status\/443684844258996224","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3829433],"posted_on":"2014-03-12T09:48:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Leonel Bobadilla B","url":"https:\/\/www.vizify.com\/francisco-leonel-bobadilla-bolivar","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1531538992\/Bobadilla_2_normal.png","description":"Docente y economista cl\u00e1sico.","id_on_source":"leobobadilla","tweeter_id":"111728160","geo":{"lt":17.98689,"ln":-92.93028,"country":"MX"},"followers":1523},"tweet_id":"443684844258996224"}]}}
