Dengue is caused by DENV-1, DENV- 2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 which are genetically distant. The species has been subdivided into genotypes based on phylogenetic studies. DENV-2, which was isolated from dengue fever patients during an outbreak in Piaui, Brazil in 2006\/2007 was analyzed by sequencing the envelope (E) gene. The results indicated a high similarity among the isolated viruses, as well as to other DENV-2 from Brazil, Central America and South America. A phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis based on DENV-2E gene sequences revealed that these viruses are grouped together with viruses of the American-Asian genotype in two distinct lineages. Our results demonstrate the co-circulation of two American-Asian genotype lineages in northeast Brazil. Moreover, we reveal that DENV-2 lineage 2 was detected in Piau\u00ed before it disseminated to other Brazilian states and South American countries, indicating the existence of a new dissemination route that has not been previously described.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Leandra Barcelos Figueiredo","Tetsu Sakamoto","Luiz Felipe Leomil Coelho","Eliseu Soares de Oliveira Rocha","Marcela Menezes Gomes Cota","Gustavo Portela Ferreira","Jaquelline Germano de Oliveira","Erna Geessien Kroon"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0104516","first_seen_on":"2015-03-23T06:05:27+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1410952616,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0104516"],"pmid":"25127366","pubdate":"2014-08-15T07:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e104516","subjects":["medicine","science"],"type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dengue-virus-2-americanasian-genotype-identified-during-20062007-outbreak-piau%C3%AD-brazil-reveals-carib"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4268403,"mean":5.0637174657686,"rank":3396354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4268403,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128041,"mean":9.7681922368012,"rank":106453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":2577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128041,"percentile":2},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75722,"mean":8.2266212015161,"rank":60078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75722,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3929,"mean":8.792233197556,"rank":3296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3929,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
