It remains unknown, however, which specific mechanisms of speech planning and execution are affected by these neurological abnormalities. To investigate pre-movement sensory modulation, we recorded 12 stuttering and 12 nonstuttering adults' auditory evoked potentials in response to probe tones presented prior to speech onset in a delayed-response speaking condition vs. no-speaking control conditions (silent reading; seeing nonlinguistic symbols). Findings indicate that, during speech movement planning, the nonstuttering group showed a statistically significant modulation of auditory processing (reduced N1 amplitude) that was not observed in the stuttering group. Thus, the obtained results provide electrophysiological evidence in support of the hypothesis that stuttering is associated with deficiencies in modulating the cortical auditory system during speech movement planning. This specific sensorimotor integration deficiency may contribute to inefficient feedback monitoring and, consequently, speech dysfluencies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002426","authors":["Daliri A","Max L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bandl.2015.03.002","first_seen_on":"2015-03-23T10:59:19+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["0093934X"],"journal":"Brain & Language","last_mentioned_on":1428670580,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0093934X15000334","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25796060","http:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/a\/1QjBW,28iJAX4E"],"pmid":"25796060","pubdate":"2015-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","speechlanguagepathology","brain"],"title":"Modulation of auditory processing during speech movement planning is limited in adults who stutter ","type":"article","volume":"143","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modulation-auditory-processing-during-speech-movement-planning-limited-adults-stutter"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4980612,"mean":5.8933709209598,"rank":598958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4380220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4980612,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146950,"mean":10.29310660161,"rank":27647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":119228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146950,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":453,"mean":5.6380353982301,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":453,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":5.0681818181818,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
