The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that there is currently no evidence to support the use of topical LP to improve pain control and reduce opiate analgesic use, in patients with traumatic rib fractures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058b5","authors":["Helen Williams","Edd Carlton"],"doi":"10.1136\/emermed-2015-204681.1","first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T07:58:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-0213"],"issue":"4","journal":"Emergency Medicine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1450350153,"links":["http:\/\/emj.bmj.com\/content\/32\/4\/333.2.short?rss=1","http:\/\/emj.bmj.com\/content\/32\/4\/333.2.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/emj.bmj.com\/content\/32\/4\/333.2.full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25804859?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/emj.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/32\/4\/333?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/emj.bmj.com\/content\/32\/4\/333.2.full.pdf","pmid":"25804859","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and the British Association for Accident & Emergency Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"333","subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"BET 1: Topical lignocaine patches in traumatic rib fractures","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bet-1-topical-lignocaine-patches-traumatic-rib-fractures-table1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6787729,"mean":6.1724472011828,"rank":2495328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4248054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6787729,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193816,"mean":9.1122044733381,"rank":70179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":121408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193816,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2144,"mean":9.1422034531031,"rank":1209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2144,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":9.238625,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CasgoConnection\/status\/580277518638297088","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3826634],"posted_on":"2015-03-24T07:58:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Casgo Connections UK","url":"http:\/\/casgoconnections.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/448557826999201792\/cK--FXX__normal.png","id_on_source":"CasgoConnection","tweeter_id":"2216606828","geo":{"lt":52.16045,"ln":-0.70312,"country":"GB"},"followers":35},"tweet_id":"580277518638297088"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WHHFTKLS\/status\/580379175757955072","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3826634],"posted_on":"2015-03-24T14:42:33+00:00","author":{"name":"WHH Evidence Service","url":"https:\/\/extranet.whh.nhs.uk\/education-and-development\/knowledge-and-evidence-service","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/906093857007435776\/QWpkPd1P_normal.jpg","description":"Tweets from the @WHHNHS Knowledge & Evidence Service Team.
