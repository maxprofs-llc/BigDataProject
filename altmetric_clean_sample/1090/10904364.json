The syntheses involve the use of KBr to manipulate the reaction kinetics by influencing the redox potentials of metal precursor ions via ligand exchange. In the absence of KBr, the ratio between the initial reduction rates of PdCl4(2-) and PtCl4(2-) was about 10.0, leading to the formation of Pd@Pt octahedra with a core-shell structure. In the presence of 63 mM KBr, the products became Pd-Pt alloy nanocrystals. In this case, the ratio between the reduction rates of the two precursors dropped to 2.4 because of ligand exchange and thus the formation of PdBr4(2-) and PtBr4(2-). The alloy nanocrystals took a cubic shape owing to the selective capping effect of Br(-) ions toward the {100} facets. Compared to the alloy nanocubes, the Pd@Pt core-shell octahedra showed substantial enhancement in both catalytic activity and durability toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, the specific (1.51 mA cm(-2)) and mass (1.05 A mg(-1) Pt) activities of the core-shell octahedra were enhanced by about four- and three-folds relative to the alloy nanocubes (0.39 mA cm(-2) and 0.34 A mg(-1) Pt, respectively). Even after 20000 cycles of accelerated durability test, the core-shell octahedra still exhibited a mass activity of 0.68 A mg(-1) Pt, twice that of a pristine commercial Pt\/C catalyst.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Zhou, Ming","Wang, Helan","Vara, Madeline","Hood, Zachary D","Luo, Ming","Yang, Tung-Han","Bao, Shi-Xiong","Chi, Miaofang","Xiao, Peng","Zhang, Yunhuai","Xia, Younan"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b07213","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T10:26:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126","0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1472552245,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27568848?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27568848","pubdate":"2016-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A Quantitative Analysis of the Reduction Kinetics Responsible for the One-pot Synthesis of Pd\u2212Pt Bimetallic Nanocrystals with Different Structures","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-analysis-reduction-kinetics-responsible-onepot-synthesis-pdpt-bimetallic-nanocrystals-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":7178780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251585,"mean":12.499825434049,"rank":211260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251585,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19186,"mean":5.2910647902007,"rank":17051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19186,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":516,"mean":7.3469669902913,"rank":443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":516,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
