Follow-up data showed reduced bladder toxicity in TomoTherapy patients compared to LINAC-IMRT. The purpose of this study was to quantify whether the treatment delivery technique and decreased margins affect reductions in bladder toxicity.\nSetup corrections from 30\u00a0patients treated with helical TomoTherapy and 30\u00a0treated with a LINAC were analyzed. These data were used to simulate three IG protocols based on setup error correction and a limited number of imaging sessions. For all patients, gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity was documented and correlated with the treatment delivery technique.\nFor fiducial marker (FM)-based RT, a margin reduction of up to\u00a03.1, 3.0, and 4.8\u00a0mm in the left-right (LR), superior-inferior (SI), and anterior-posterior (AP) directions, respectively, could be achieved with calculation of a setup correction from the first three fractions and IG every second day. Although the bladder volume was treated with mean doses of 35\u00a0Gy in the TomoTherapy group vs. 22\u00a0Gy in the LINAC group, we observed less GU toxicity after TomoTherapy.\nIntraprostate FMs allow for small safety margins, help decrease imaging frequency after setup correction, and minimize the dose to bladder and rectum, resulting in lower GU toxicity. In addition, IMRT delivered with TomoTherapy helps to avoid hotspots in the bladder neck, a critical anatomic structure associated with post-RT urinary toxicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008a40","authors":["Drozdz, Sonia","Schwedas, Michael","Salz, Henning","Foller, Susan","Wendt, Thomas G"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00066-015-0935-y","endpage":"231","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T13:00:24+00:00","issns":["1439-099X","0179-7158"],"issue":"4","journal":"Strahlentherapie und Onkologie","last_mentioned_on":1472562007,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26742732?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26742732","pubdate":"2016-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Radiotherapy","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"223","subjects":["neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Prostate cancer treated with image-guided helical TomoTherapy\u00ae and image-guided LINAC-IMRT","type":"article","volume":"192","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prostate-cancer-treated-imageguided-helical-tomotherapy-imageguided-linacimrt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":7178689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251588,"mean":12.499610997388,"rank":211233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251588,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255,"mean":3.2852519685039,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.284,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
