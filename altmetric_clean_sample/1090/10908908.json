Recent analyses suggest that <5\u00a0% of treated hypertensive patients remain uncontrolled if fully adherent to an optimized antihypertensive treatment. However, these patients do have increased cardiovascular risk and need effective therapeutic approaches. Drug development is a high-risk, complex, lengthy, and very expensive process. In this article, we discuss the factors that should be considered in the process of developing a new agent for treatment of resistant hypertension.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000705c","authors":["Pimenta, Eduardo","Calhoun, David A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11906-016-0634-9","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T12:47:51+00:00","issns":["1534-3111","1522-6417"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Hypertension Reports","last_mentioned_on":1472680686,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26949263"],"pmid":"26949263","pubdate":"2016-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"General Practice \/ Family Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Metabolic Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nephrology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Primary Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Drug Development for Hypertension: Do We Need Another Antihypertensive Agent for Resistant Hypertension?","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/drug-development-hypertension-we-need-another-antihypertensive-agent-resistant-hypertension-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":4117841,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4126051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251641,"mean":12.499514997615,"rank":125425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":123897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251641,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":342,"mean":3.4680527859238,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":342,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":5.1666666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2},"mendeley":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UABCardiology\/statuses\/770603114080641024","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10908908],"posted_on":"2016-08-30T12:44:34+00:00","author":{"name":"UAB Cardiology","url":"http:\/\/uab.edu\/medicine\/cardiovascularcenter\/symposium","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/804403596666224640\/qJ_xF13o_normal.jpg","description":"World-renowned for excellence in cardiovascular disease patient care, education, and research","id_on_source":"UABCardiology","tweeter_id":"4062846135","geo":{"lt":33.52066,"ln":-86.80249,"country":"US"},"followers":463},"tweet_id":"770603114080641024"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bme_prof\/statuses\/771104804579966977","license":"gnip","rt":["UABCardiology"],"citation_ids":[10908908],"posted_on":"2016-08-31T21:58:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Palaniappan Sethu","url":"https:\/\/www.uab.edu\/engineering\/home\/faculty-staff\/170-sethu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3342121987\/9aa6acc6ac00037a0fbbbfed515633b1_normal.jpeg","description":"Associate Professor of Medicine and Biomedical Engineering, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Division of Cardiovascular Disease","id_on_source":"bme_prof","tweeter_id":"143074334","geo":{"lt":33.52066,"ln":-86.80249,"country":"US"},"followers":44},"tweet_id":"771104804579966977"}]}}
