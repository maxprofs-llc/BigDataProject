A direct catalytic enantioselective method for the synthesis of P-chiral compounds from easily accessible diaryl phosphinamides is presented. The use of rhodium(III) complexes equipped with a suitable atropochiral cyclopentadienyl ligand is shown to enable an enantiodetermining C-H activation step. Upon trapping with alkynes, a broad variety of cyclic phosphinamides with a stereogenic phosphorus(V) atom are formed in high yields and enantioselectivities. Moreover, these can be reduced enantiospecifically to P-chiral phosphorus(III) compounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Sun, Yang","Cramer, Nicolai"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201606637","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T10:46:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
