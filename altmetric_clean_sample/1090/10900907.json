The mechanism of action is thought to be via an increase in viscosity of the stomach contents that delays gastric emptying and reduces mixing of food with digestive enzymes, which, in turn, retards glucose absorption. Previous studies suggest that taking viscous fibers separate from a meal may not be effective in reducing postprandial glycemia.\nWe aimed to re-assess the effect of consuming a preload of a commercially available oat-bran (4.5, 13.6 or 27.3 g) containing 22% of high molecular weight oat \u03b2-glucan (O22 (OatWell(\u00ae)22)) mixed in water before a test-meal of white bread on glycemic responses in 10 healthy humans.\nWe found a significant effect of dose on blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) (p = 0.006) with AUC after 27.3 g of O22 being significantly lower than white bread only. Linear regression analysis showed that each gram of oat \u03b2-glucan reduced glucose AUC by 4.35% \u00b1 1.20% (r = 0.507, p = 0.0008, n = 40) and peak rise by 6.57% \u00b1 1.49% (r = 0.582, p < 0.0001).\nThese data suggest the use of oat bran as nutritional preload strategy in the management of postprandial glycemia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6573cf058f610009228","authors":["Robert Steinert","Steinert, Robert E","Raederstorff, Daniel","Wolever, Thomas M S","Daniel Raederstorff","Thomas Wolever"],"doi":"10.3390\/nu8090524","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T06:57:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2072-6643"],"issue":"9","journal":"Nutrients","last_mentioned_on":1488914777,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/8\/9\/524","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27571099","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/8\/9\/524?utm_content=buffer7bd95&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/8\/9\/524?utm_content=34743136&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27571099"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/8\/9\/524\/pdf","pmid":"27571099","pubdate":"2016-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"524","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Effect of Consuming Oat Bran Mixed in Water before a Meal on Glycemic Responses in Healthy Humans\u2014A Pilot Study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/8\/9\/524","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-consuming-oat-bran-mixed-water-before-meal-glycemic-responses-healthy-humansa-pilot-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.25,"score_history":{"1y":6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":1189546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":7122797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251766,"mean":12.498417190634,"rank":52219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":199187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251766,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2646,"mean":14.792450661626,"rank":835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2646,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168,"mean":17.569281437126,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2,"practitioner":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":5,"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
