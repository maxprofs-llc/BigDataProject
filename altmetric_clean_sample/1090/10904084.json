Phages are categorized based on the type of their life cycle, the lytic cycle cause lysis of the bacterium with the release of multiple phage particles where as in lysogenic phase the phage DNA is incorporated into the bacterial genome. Lysogeny does not result in lysis of the host. Lytic phages have several potential applications in the food industry as biocontrol agents, biopreservatives and as tools for detecting pathogens. They have also been proposed as alternatives to antibiotics in animal health. Two unique features of phage relevant for food safety are that they are harmless to mammalian cells and high host specificity, keeping the natural microbiota undisturbed. However, the recent approval of bacteriophages as food additives has opened the discussion about 'edible viruses'. This article reviews in detail the application of phages for the control of foodborne pathogens in a process known as \"biocontrol\".","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c8c","authors":["Kazi, Mustafa","Annapure, Uday S"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13197-015-1996-8","endpage":"1362","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T10:05:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-1155","0975-8402"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Food Science and Technology","last_mentioned_on":1472552706,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27570260?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27570260","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry\/Food Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nutrition","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1355","title":"Bacteriophage biocontrol of foodborne pathogens","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bacteriophage-biocontrol-foodborne-pathogens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":6003207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2002646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251587,"mean":12.499710365441,"rank":163976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":73090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251587,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":458,"mean":3.4192560175055,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":458,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.5,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
