It has been shown to predict long-term clinical outcomes in patients with left main or multi-vessel disease and recently also in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the syntax score is associated with short-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\nSyntax score was determined in 90 consecutive patients (mean age 54.2\u00b111.6) of STEMI undergoing primary PCI. Outcomes were stratified according to syntax score groups: SX low \u226415 (n=33), SX mid 16-22 (n=30), and SX high \u226523 (n=27). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30 days. Secondary endpoints were nonfatal major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of any repeat revascularization, acute coronary syndrome, and stroke at 30 days in patients discharged alive.\nMortality at 30 days was higher in the SX high group compared to the SX mid and SX low group (18.5% vs 3.3% p=0.011), MACE at 30 days was higher in SX high group compared to SX mid and SX low group (48.1% vs 16.6% vs 9.1%, p=0.001).\nThe syntax score is associated with 30-day mortality in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. In those discharged, it is associated with risk of MACE at 30 days.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000cdac","authors":["Sarita Choudhary"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ihj.2016.08.002","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T11:11:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00194832","0019-4832"],"journal":"Indian heart journal","last_mentioned_on":1473074535,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0019483216303455","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0019483216303455?cc%3Dy%26sf34734768%3D1","http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0019483216303455?via=sd&cc=y&sf34734768=1"],"pmid":"28400034","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Association of syntax score with short-term outcomes among acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing primary PCI","type":"article","volume":"69 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-syntax-score-shortterm-outcomes-among-acute-stelevation-myocardial-infarction-patients-u-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":1955237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6362473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251863,"mean":12.498758590021,"rank":76877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":174274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251863,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320,"mean":2.2520062695925,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.9251515151515,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1,"FR":1,"US":1,"VE":1,"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/estudiomedicina\/statuses\/770579573817782273","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10905036],"posted_on":"2016-08-30T11:11:01+00:00","author":{"name":"estudiomedicina","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1375626399\/209a_normal.gif","description":"El medico nunca deja de estudiar ni de ayudar.
