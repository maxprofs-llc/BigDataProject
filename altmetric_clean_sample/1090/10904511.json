In this review we address state of the art clinical approaches to diagnose psychiatric disorders and underline the necessity to found new tools to help clinicians.\nWe provide an update on proteomic studies and suggest potential biomarkers focusing on schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depression (MD). In particular, we direct our attention to proteomic results obtained from studies on biological fluids. We also show an interaction analysis of differentially expressed proteins found in SCZ, BD and MD. Expert commentary: To date, there is a need to find molecular biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. The use of a proteomic approach allows protein fingerprints to be defined in normal and pathological states. We believe that saliva is an intriguing biological fluid, whose proteomic study in psychiatric disorders is still in its early stages.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d9","authors":["Giusti, Laura","Ciregia, Federica","Mazzoni, Maria Rosa","Lucacchini, Antonio","Laura Giusti"],"doi":"10.1080\/14789450.2016.1230499","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T10:43:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-8387","1478-9450"],"journal":"Expert Review of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1473387299,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27568681?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14789450.2016.1230499?ai=1lx1s&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"27568681","pubdate":"2016-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Proteomics Insight into Psychiatric Disorders: an Update on Biological Fluid Biomarkers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteomics-insight-psychiatric-disorders-update-biological-fluid-biomarkers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":4210172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3927579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252023,"mean":12.501983176072,"rank":127737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":114247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252023,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":361,"mean":1.7456388888889,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":361,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.7130434782609,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
