Mycobacterial DNA gyrase B subunit has been identified to be one of the potentially under exploited drug targets in the field of antitubercular drug discovery. In the present review, we discussed the synthesis, structural optimization and docking study of effective potent DNA gyrase inhibitor against M. tuberculosis, with improved properties such as enhanced activity against MDR strains, reduced toxicity. Based on this progress, if we can successfully leverage the opportunities in this target, there is hope that we will be able to raise novel gyrase inhibitor in earnest in the long.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["Chaudhari, Kavita","Surana, Sanjay","Jain, Pritam","Patel, Harun M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2016.08.034","endpage":"185","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T10:12:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1768-3254","02235234"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1472561710,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27569197?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27569197","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"160","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) GyrB inhibitors: An attractive approach for developing novel drugs against TB","type":"article","volume":"124","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mycobacterium-tuberculosis-mtb-gyrb-inhibitors-attractive-approach-developing-novel-drugs-against-tb"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":6299472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1123462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251588,"mean":12.49961199108,"rank":178491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251588,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1151,"mean":1.854572173913,"rank":562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1151,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":2.0804347826087,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
