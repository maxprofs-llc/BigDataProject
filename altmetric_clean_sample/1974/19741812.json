However, the ability of practitioners to measure bandage application to a desired pressure profile is difficult because of sensor limitations. We have used a novel fibre-optic-based, high-resolution sub-bandage pressure monitor to measure adherence to a target pressure gradient during compression bandaging. Participants of various experience (n\u2009=\u200946) were asked to bandage a lower-leg manikin to a gradient of 40 (ankle) to 20 mmHg (proximal calf) in both a blinded trial and subsequently with sensor feedback. Mean pressures across all sensors for both the blind and sensor-guided trials approximated a target mean of 30 mmHg. However, the mean gradient achieved in the blinded trial showed an inverse pressure gradient to the target with a high-pressure region at the mid-calf (44\u2009\u00b1\u200919 mmHg). Correlation to the target gradient improved from R(2) = 0\u00b762 during the blind trial to 0\u00b793 using sensor feedback, with a gradient that closely approximated the target. This demonstrates the use of high-resolution sub-bandage pressure sensing in improving the ability of practitioners to achieve a target pressure gradient in compression bandaging for clinical use and training.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e83cf058f6100059c4","authors":["Luke A Parkinson","Malou van Zanten","Neil Piller","John W Arkwright"],"doi":"10.1111\/iwj.12741","first_seen_on":"2017-04-30T14:40:24+00:00","issns":["17424801"],"journal":"International Wound Journal","last_mentioned_on":1491984013,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/iwj.12741"],"pmid":"28296351","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"A high-resolution tape sensor improves the accuracy of applied pressure profiles during lower-leg bandaging\u00a0-\u00a0results from a study using a fibre-optic sensing tape","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highresolution-tape-sensor-improves-accuracy-applied-pressure-profiles-during-lowerleg-bandaging-res"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063599,"mean":6.8425680134317,"rank":6982224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063599,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229428,"mean":12.558253448809,"rank":185746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229428,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":365,"mean":4.4263296703297,"rank":283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":365,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.42,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=351072811961298&id=236554230079824","license":"public","citation_ids":[19741812],"posted_on":"2017-04-12T08:00:13+00:00","summary":"Using a fibre-optic sensing tape to improve the applied pressure of lower leg bandages. #UIP2018 http:\/\/ow.ly\/q0gZ30aMU69","author":{"name":"UIP World Congress of Phlebology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/236554230079824","facebook_wall_name":"UIP World Congress of Phlebology","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/236554230079824\/picture","id_on_source":"236554230079824"}}]}}
