For many years the subject of ankyloglossia has been controversial, with practitioners of many specialties having widely different views regarding its significance. In many children, ankyloglossia is asymptomatic; the condition may resolve spontaneously, or affected children may learn to compensate adequately for their decreased lingual mobility. Some children, however, benefit from surgical intervention (frenotomy or frenuloplasty) for their tongue-tie. Parents should be educated about the possible long-term effects of tongue-tie while their child is young (< 1 year of age), so that they may make an informed choice regarding possible therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c15","authors":["M Lauren Lalakea","Anna H Messner"],"first_seen_on":"2014-05-09T03:35:15+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0031-3955"],"issue":"2","journal":"Pediatric clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1399528800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12809329"],"pmid":"12809329","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Ankyloglossia: does it matter?","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ankyloglossia-it-matter"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3729568,"mean":4.9806692796985,"rank":406725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3314480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3729568,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95009,"mean":7.1815764988212,"rank":12610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":82209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95009,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322,"mean":1.9418753894081,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
