In response, some dairy processors increased the times and temperatures of pasteurization well above the legal minimum for high temperature, short time pasteurization (72 \u00b0C for 15 s), with unknown implications for public health. The present study was conducted to determine whether an increase in high temperature, short time pasteurization temperature would affect the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, a potentially lethal foodborne pathogen normally eliminated with proper pasteurization but of concern when milk is contaminated postpasteurization. L. monocytogenes growth during refrigerated storage was higher in milk pasteurized at 82 \u00b0C than in milk pasteurized at 72 \u00b0C. Specifically, the time lag before exponential growth was decreased and the maximum population density was increased. The public health impact of this change in pasteurization was evaluated using a quantitative microbial risk assessment of deaths from listeriosis attributable to consumption of pasteurized fluid milk that was contaminated postprocessing. Conservative estimates of the effect of pasteurizing all fluid milk at 82 \u00b0C rather than 72 \u00b0C are that annual listeriosis deaths from consumption of this milk would increase from 18 to 670, a 38-fold increase (8.7- to 96-fold increase, 5th and 95th percentiles). These results exemplify a situation in which response to a rare bioterror threat may have the unintended consequence of putting the public at increased risk of a known, yet severe harm and illustrate the need for a paradigm shift toward multioutcome risk benefit analyses when proposing changes to established food safety practices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db1","authors":["Stasiewicz MJ","Martin N","Laue S","Gr\u00f6hn YT","Boor KJ","Wiedmann M"],"doi":"10.4315\/0362-028x.jfp-13-191","first_seen_on":"2014-05-09T15:40:52+00:00","issns":["0362-028X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Food Protection","last_mentioned_on":1399650037,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24780323"],"pmid":"24780323","pubdate":"2014-05-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Responding to bioterror concerns by increasing milk pasteurization temperature would increase estimated annual deaths from listeriosis.","type":"article","volume":"77","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/responding-bioterror-concerns-increasing-milk-pasteurization-temperature-increase-estimated-annual-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3731357,"mean":4.9821613654696,"rank":2079627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":962065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3731357,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95060,"mean":7.1782100800556,"rank":49537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95060,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":505,"mean":2.6880079365079,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":505,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":3.368,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
