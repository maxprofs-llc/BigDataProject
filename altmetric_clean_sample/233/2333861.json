Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can diminish contagiousness by reducing viral load levels in HIV-infected individuals. To test the assumption that reductions in contagiousness can lead to a decrease in stigmatizing reactions, we conducted an experimental online study. A sample of 752 participants (50.9% female) read a short vignette depicting an HIV-positive individual with either a high or a low viral load and were either given or not given information about the association between viral load and contagiousness. Subsequently, participants were asked to rate their willingness to stigmatize this individual by responding to two measures of social and physical distance. Differences between the low and the high viral load information groups and the combined no-information groups (forming a quasi-control group) were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for gender and baseline perceptions of contagiousness. The covariates, perceived contagiousness at baseline and gender, were associated with social and physical distancing, but the viral load\/information factor was only significant in physical distancing. Planned contrast analyses confirmed that physical distancing in the informed group was lower in the low viral load condition compared to the high viral load condition and to the control group. We thus found evidence for the significant role of perceived contagiousness in the HIV-related stigma and were able to experimentally demonstrate the potential of ART to reduce HIV-related stigmatization by lowering viral load and contagiousness, when these changes are accompanied by a decreased perception of contagiousness.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000156b","authors":["Drewes J","Kleiber D"],"doi":"10.1080\/09540121.2014.913768","first_seen_on":"2014-05-07T19:35:53+00:00","issns":["0954-0121"],"issue":"","journal":"AIDS Care","last_mentioned_on":1400912789,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24779483"],"pmid":"24779483","pubdate":"2014-05-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Contagiousness under antiretroviral therapy and stigmatization toward people with HIV.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contagiousness-under-antiretroviral-therapy-stigmatization-toward-people-hiv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3554455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":835691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124869,"mean":7.9084304225264,"rank":83312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124869,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":874,"mean":2.5950103092784,"rank":682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":874,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2.5975609756098,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
