MSM might be particularly vulnerable to sexual victimization and forced sex. The aim of this research study was to examine prevalence of sexual victimization and correlates of forced sex among Japanese MSM. We recruited a sample of 5,731 Japanese MSM who completed an internet-administered survey. Participants reported on history of different types of sexual victimization, unprotected anal sex, other health risk behaviors, exposure to gay-related teasing and bullying, depression, and suicidality. Over one-fifth of the sample (21.4%) reported experiencing at least one form of sexual victimization, and 8.7% reported a history of forced sex. MSM who had ever experienced forced sex were significantly more likely to report experiencing psychological risks (depression OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.28-1.89; attempted suicide OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.81-2.81; other forms of bullying OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.13-1.68) and other behavioral risks (unprotected anal sex OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.29-1.90; sex venue attendance OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.04-1.54; methamphetamine use OR = 1.57, 95% CI \u200a= 1.05-1.36), compared to MSM who had not experienced forced sex. Efforts to develop holistic and integrated health services for Japanese MSM are warranted, particularly related to psychosocial determinants of HIV prevention. However, due to cultural factors that emphasize familial and social relations and that stigmatize same-sex behavior, Japanese MSM might experience challenges to seeking social support and health services. Interventions must be provided in safe and non-judgmental settings where Japanese MSM feel comfortable disclosing their health and social support needs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yasuharu Hidaka","Don Operario","Hiroyuki Tsuji","Mie Takenaka","Hirokazu Kimura","Mitsuhiro Kamakura","Seiichi Ichikawa"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0095675","first_seen_on":"2014-05-07T04:17:34+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1445024823,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0095675","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24802357?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4011701\/?report=classic","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4011701\/table\/pone-0095675-t002\/","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0095675"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0095675.pdf","pmid":"24802357","pubdate":"2014-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e95675","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Prevalence of Sexual Victimization and Correlates of Forced Sex in Japanese Men Who Have Sex with Men","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-sexual-victimization-correlates-forced-sex-japanese-men-sex-men-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396793,"mean":7.072248910052,"rank":2073023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6283747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396793,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180150,"mean":7.4726368506073,"rank":45942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":133310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180150,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115809,"mean":10.642454061896,"rank":37037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":77838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115809,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3530,"mean":13.30565826013,"rank":1209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3530,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
