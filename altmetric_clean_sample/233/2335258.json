Ask your MD. Vit D can improve quality of life reduce disease activity. #IBD"],"citation":{"abstract":"Vitamin D deficiency is commonly diagnosed among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at risk of low bone density and increased fractures due to low vitamin D levels, long standing disease, and frequent steroid exposures; as a result, it is well established that vitamin D supplementation in this population is important. There is increasing support for the role of vitamin D in strengthening the innate immune system by acting as an immunomodulator and reducing inflammation in experimental and human IBD. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)D3, acts on T cells to promote T helper (Th)2\/regulatory T responses over Th1\/Th17 responses; suppresses dendritic cell inflammatory activity; induces antibacterial activity; and regulates cytokine production in favor of an anti-inflammatory response. Murine and human IBD studies support a therapeutic role of vitamin D in IBD. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in this population include decreased sunlight exposure, disease duration, smoking, and genetics. Vitamin D normalization is associated with reduced risk of relapse, reduced risk of IBD-related surgeries, and improvement in quality of life. Vitamin D is an inexpensive supplement which has been shown to improve IBD outcomes. However, further research is required to determine optimal serum vitamin D levels which will achieve beneficial immune effects, and stronger evidence is needed to support the role of vitamin D in inducing disease response and remission, as well as maintaining this improvement in patients' disease states.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Krista M Reich","Richard N Fedorak","Karen Madsen","Karen I Kroeker"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.v20.i17.4934","first_seen_on":"2014-05-08T08:37:47+00:00","issns":["1007-9327"],"issue":"17","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1490643400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24803805","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24803805?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4009525\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4009525\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4009525","pmid":"24803805","pubdate":"2014-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Baishideng Publishing Group Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"4934","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Vitamin D improves inflammatory bowel disease outcomes: Basic science and clinical review.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.wjgnet.com\/1007-9327\/full\/v20\/i17\/4934.htm","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-improves-inflammatory-bowel-disease-outcomes-basic-science-clinical-review-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":1235706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7111116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179903,"mean":7.5055028849043,"rank":28593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":149978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179903,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3716,"mean":3.4376220726783,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3716,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213,"mean":2.143,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
