The rapid capacity fading, however, presents a significant challenge for the practical application of sulfur cathodes. Two major approaches that have been developed to improve the sulfur cathode performance include (a) fabricating nanostructured conductive matrix to physically encapsulate sulfur and (b) engineering chemical modification to enhance binding with polysulfides and, thus, to reduce their dissolution. Here, we report a three-dimensional (3D) electrode structure to achieve both sulfur physical encapsulation and polysulfides binding simultaneously. The electrode is based on hydrogen reduced TiO2 with an inverse opal structure that is highly conductive and robust toward electrochemical cycling. The relatively enclosed 3D structure provides an ideal architecture for sulfur and polysulfides confinement. The openings at the top surface allow sulfur infusion into the inverse opal structure. In addition, chemical tuning of the TiO2 composition through hydrogen reduction was shown to enhance the specific capacity and cyclability of the cathode. With such TiO2 encapsulated sulfur structure, the sulfur cathode could deliver a high specific capacity of \u223c1100 mAh\/g in the beginning, with a reversible capacity of \u223c890 mAh\/g after 200 cycles of charge\/discharge at a C\/5 rate. The Coulombic efficiency was also maintained at around 99.5% during cycling. The results showed that inverse opal structure of hydrogen reduced TiO2 represents an effective strategy in improving lithium sulfur batteries performance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Zheng Liang"],"doi":"10.1021\/nn501308m","first_seen_on":"2014-05-07T12:01:41+00:00","issns":["1936-0851"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1407229200,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn501308m","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/nn501308m"],"pmid":"24766547","pubdate":"2014-04-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Sulfur Cathodes with Hydrogen Reduced Titanium Dioxide Inverse Opal Structure.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sulfur-cathodes-hydrogen-reduced-titanium-dioxide-inverse-opal-structure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.238,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.238},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":369440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4138098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108205,"mean":7.6846166130645,"rank":12331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":95873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108205,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3520,"mean":8.6839840863882,"rank":694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3520,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256,"mean":8.7115607843137,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
