Severity of depression was measured using the 21-item Hamilton depression rating scale (HRS) and a second linear rating scale (LRS) of severity of depressive symptoms that omitted anxiety symptoms. There was a significant correlation between the ratio of erythrocyte PL arachidonic acid (AA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and severity of depression as rated by the HRS (P < 0.05) and the LRS for depression (P < 0.01). There was also a significant negative correlation between erythrocyte EPA and the LRS (P < 0.05). The AA\/EPA ratio in plasma PL and the ratio of erythrocyte long-chain (C20 and C22 carbon) n-6 to long-chain n-3 PUFA were also significantly correlated with the LRS (P < 0.05). These findings do not appear to be simply explained by differences in dietary intake of EPA. We cannot determine whether the high ratios of AA\/EPA in both plasma and erythrocyte PL are the result of depression or whether tissue PUFA change predate the depressive symptoms. We suggest, however, that our findings provide a basis for studying the effect of the nutritional supplementation of depressed subjects, aimed at reducing the AA\/EPA ratio in tissues and severity of depression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f61000805e","authors":["P B Adams","S Lawson","A Sanigorski","A J Sinclair"],"first_seen_on":"2014-05-08T15:24:33+00:00","issns":["0024-4201"],"journal":"Lipids","last_mentioned_on":1444222760,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8729112"],"pmid":"8729112","pubdate":"1996-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid ratio in blood correlates positively with clinical symptoms of depression.","type":"article","volume":"31 Suppl","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arachidonic-acid-eicosapentaenoic-acid-ratio-blood-correlates-positively-clinical-symptoms-depressio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6265888,"mean":5.9560405915417,"rank":2567772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3558987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6265888,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134228,"mean":8.0003768541352,"rank":55186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":74941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134228,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":505,"mean":5.5676388888889,"rank":285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":505,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.745,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
