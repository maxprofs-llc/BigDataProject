Every week, we offer an optimistic, but not utopian, take on the future and humanity\u2019s ability to tackle the great challenges of our era through industry, technology and ingenuity.\n\nWe cover science and technology with an eye toward what is possible now and what will be tomorrow in renewable energy, transportation, infrastructure, artificial intelligence and other topics. Txchnologist will offer a blend of stories and visuals that communicate the ideas that will shape societies, from the developing world to our frenetic and growing cities.\n\nTxchnologist, while sponsored by GE, takes a broader look at the world of science and technology. The stories and opinions do not necessarily reflect the views of the company.\n\nWe hope you\u2019ll join the conversation in the comments section and share our stories on Twitter, Facebook, or Google Plus."}}]}}
