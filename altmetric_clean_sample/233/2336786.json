Data were collected at a public, outpatient program among clients initiating treatment (N=200). Baseline surveys included measures of treatment-related attitudes, norms, perceived control, and intention; discharge status was collected from program records. As expected, TPB attitude and control components independently predicted intention (model R-squared=.56), and intention was positively associated with treatment completion even including clinical and demographic covariates (model R-squared=.24). TPB components were generally associated with the alternative readiness scales as expected, and the TPB remained predictive at higher levels of coercion. Meanwhile, none of the standard measures of readiness (e.g., the URICA and TREAT) or treatment coercion were positively associated with treatment participation. Results suggest promise for application of the TPB to treatment completion and support use of the intention component as a screener, though some refinements are suggested.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f45","doi":"10.1016\/j.jsat.2013.06.011","first_seen_on":"2014-05-08T17:53:06+00:00","issns":["07405472"],"journal":"Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1399571542,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jsat.2013.06.011#.U2vCP06GdEM.facebook","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0740547213001451"],"pmid":"23953167","pubdate":"2013-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Predicting substance abuse treatment completion using a new scale based on the theory of planned behavior.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predicting-substance-abuse-treatment-completion-using-new-scale-based-theory-planned-behavior-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2125421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2234075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107685,"mean":7.7203010475096,"rank":47225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":55817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107685,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":558,"mean":2.8206678635548,"rank":231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":558,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.14,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
