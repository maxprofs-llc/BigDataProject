A novel technique (Solomon technique) using laser coagulation of the entire vascular equator was recently investigated in a randomized controlled trial (Solomon trial) and compared with the Standard selective laser technique. The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate the occurrence and characteristics of residual anastomoses in placentas included in the Solomon trial.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000570e","doi":"10.1016\/j.ajog.2014.05.012","first_seen_on":"2014-05-09T17:13:39+00:00","issns":["0002-9378"],"journal":"American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1418230789,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajog.org%2Farticle%2FS0002-9378%252814%252900449-9%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes%3Frss%3Dyes&code=ymob-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajog.org%2Farticle%2FS0002-9378%252814%252900449-9%2Ffulltext&code=ymob-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/S0002937814004499\/pdf","pmid":"24813598","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Residual anastomoses in twin-twin transfusion syndrome after laser: the Solomon randomized trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/residual-anastomoses-twintwin-transfusion-syndrome-after-laser-solomon-randomized-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4605903,"mean":5.4169130224306,"rank":1992289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2567399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4605903,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108580,"mean":7.9532636697704,"rank":41515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":65628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108580,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3147,"mean":4.9290845518118,"rank":1579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":1522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3147,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":9.97125,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
