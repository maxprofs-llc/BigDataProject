Although vascular cylinder cells seem to be involved in the formation of root-knot nematode (RKN) feeding structures, molecular evidence is scarce. We address the role during gall development of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN 16 (LBD16), a key component of the auxin pathway leading to the divisions in the xylem pole pericycle (XPP) for lateral root (LR) formation. Arabidopsis T-DNA tagged J0192 and J0121 XPP marker lines, LBD16 and DR5::GUS promoter lines, and isolated J0192 protoplasts were assayed for nematode-dependent gene expression. Infection tests in LBD16 knock-out lines were used for functional analysis. J0192 and J0121 lines were activated in early developing galls and giant cells (GCs), resembling the pattern of the G2\/M-transition specific ProC yc B 1;1 :CycB1;1(NT)-GUS line. LBD16 was regulated by auxins in galls as in LRs, and induced by RKN secretions. LBD16 loss of function mutants and a transgenic line with defective XPP cells showed a significantly reduced infection rate. The results show that genes expressed in the dividing XPP, particularly LBD16, are important for gall formation, as they are for LR development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031cc","authors":["Cabrera J","D\u00edaz-Manzano FE","Sanchez M","Rosso MN","Melillo T","Goh T","Fukaki H","Cabello S","Hofmann J","Fenoll C","Escobar C","Cabrera, Javier","D\u00edaz\u2010Manzano, Fernando E.","Sanchez, Mar\u00eda","Rosso, Marie\u2010No\u00eblle","Melillo, Teresa","Goh, Tatsuaki","Fukaki, Hidehiro","Cabello, Susana","Hofmann, Julia","Fenoll, Carmen","Escobar, Carolina","Daz\u2010Manzano, Fernando E.","Sanchez, Mara","Rosso, Marie\u2010Nolle"],"doi":"10.1111\/nph.12826","endpage":"645","first_seen_on":"2014-05-08T13:54:09+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1469-8137","0028-646X"],"issue":"2","journal":"New Phytologist","last_mentioned_on":1431702367,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nph.12826\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24803293?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nph.12826\/pdf","pmid":"24803293","pubdate":"2014-05-05T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"632","subjects":["botany"],"title":"A role for LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN 16 during the interaction Arabidopsis-Meloidogyne spp. provides a molecular link between lateral root and root-knot nematode feeding site development.","type":"article","volume":"203","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-lateral-organ-boundariesdomain-16-during-interaction-arabidopsismeloidogyne-spp-provides-molecu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6649169,"mean":6.1585009616215,"rank":1373117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5264001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6649169,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171176,"mean":6.9762295779176,"rank":37351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":133373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171176,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2969,"mean":7.1708173854447,"rank":1215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2969,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":7.3717,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
