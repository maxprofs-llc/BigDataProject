Upon band gap-excitation by light illumination, \u03b1-MoO3 is able to store a portion of the excited charges in its layered structure with the simultaneous intercalation of alkali cations. The stored electrons can be discharged from \u03b1-MoO3 for utilisation under dark conditions, and \u03b1-MoO3 is able to recharge itself with successive illuminations to behave as a 'self-photo-rechargeable' alkali-ion battery. The alteration of the anodisation pH allowed the crystal structure and oxygen vacancy concentrations of \u03b1-MoO3 to be modulated to achieve (i) a distorted MoO6 octahedra for enhanced charge separation and storage, (ii) a layered structure with a greater exposed (010) crystal face for rich and reversible ion intercalation and (iii) a highly crystalline thin film that suppresses electron-hole pair recombination. Overall, the larger MoO6 octahedral distortion in \u03b1-MoO3 at a higher pH favours charge storage, whereas smaller octahedral distortion at a lower pH leads to anodic photocurrent enhancement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Lou SN","Ng YH","Ng C","Scott J","Amal R","Lou, Shi Nee","Ng, Yun Hau","Ng, Charlene","Scott, Jason","Amal, Rose","Shi Nee Lou","Yun Hau Ng","Charlene Ng","Jason Scott","Rose Amal"],"doi":"10.1002\/cssc.201400047","endpage":"1941","first_seen_on":"2014-05-08T14:13:16+00:00","issns":["1864-564X","1864-5631"],"issue":"7","journal":"ChemSusChem","last_mentioned_on":1399558367,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201400047\/abstract;jsessionid=0412000D77F84C8AA79B985C5CA9D860.f01t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201400047\/pdf","pmid":"24811956","pubdate":"2014-05-07T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Materials Science","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1934","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Harvesting, Storing and Utilising Solar Energy using MoO3: Modulating Structural Distortion through pH Adjustment","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/harvesting-storing-utilising-solar-energy-using-moo3-modulating-structural-distortion-through-ph-adj"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6254107,"mean":5.9900764032475,"rank":4625194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":937942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6254107,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137431,"mean":7.8936257585681,"rank":91034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":26097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137431,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":356,"mean":5.0464112676056,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":356,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.3565217391304,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
