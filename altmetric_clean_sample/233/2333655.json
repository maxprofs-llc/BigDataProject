In this unique structure, the \u03b5-amino groups of disulfide linked poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and polylysine (mPEG-SS-PLL) are partially replaced by histidine groups, in order to develop the histidylated reversible-PEGylated polylysine (mPEG-SS-PLH), for enhanced endosome escape ability. The transfection efficacy of mPEG-SS-PLH is found to closely correlate with histidine substitution. Its maximum transfection efficiencies are determined, respectively, to be 75%, 42%, and 24%, against 293T, MCF-7, and PC-3 cells. These data indicate that the transfection efficiencies can equal or even outweigh PEI-25k in the corresponding cells (80%, 38.5%, and 20%). The in vivo circulation and biodistribution of the polyplexes are monitored by fluorescent imaging. The in vivo gene transfection is carried out by intravenous injection of pEGFP to BALB\/c mice using the xenograft models. The in vivo experimental results show effective inhibition of tumor growth by mPEG-SS-PLH\/siRNA-VEGF, indicating its high potential for clinical applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006894","authors":["Cai, Xiaojun","Zhu, Haiyan","Dong, Haiqing","Li, Yongyong","Su, Jiansheng","Shi, Donglu"],"doi":"10.1002\/adhm.201400063","endpage":"1827","first_seen_on":"2014-05-07T18:19:22+00:00","issns":["2192-2659","2192-2640"],"issue":"11","journal":"Advanced Healthcare Materials","last_mentioned_on":1399486714,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adhm.201400063\/abstract;jsessionid=486F9147412802557DE3A95C12FC0FB3.f04t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adhm.201400063\/pdf","pmid":"24805287","pubdate":"2014-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1818","title":"Suppression of VEGF by Reversible\u2010PEGylated Histidylated Polylysine in Cancer Therapy","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suppression-vegf-reversiblepegylated-histidylated-polylysine-cancer-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6306418,"mean":5.9759110537734,"rank":4659954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6306418,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143329,"mean":7.7169492492746,"rank":94893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":26669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143329,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":542,"mean":5.9463401109057,"rank":366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":542,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":5.3357916666667,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
