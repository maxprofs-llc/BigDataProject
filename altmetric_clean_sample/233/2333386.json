In this study, we evaluated the outcome of an intervention program for infants with PTFD. LBW infants with PTFD (N=21) completed feeding behavior questionnaires at entry and after completing the program and were compared to a matched control group. PTFD group infants showed a significantly high rate of food disorder symptoms at entry but not at follow-up compared to the control group. The intervention program for PTFD infants resulted in reduced feeding disorder symptoms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a86","authors":["Markus Wilken","Peter Bartmann"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pedn.2014.04.001","first_seen_on":"2014-05-07T17:34:44+00:00","issns":["1532-8449","08825963"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1413367526,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24796517?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0882596314001171"],"pmid":"24796517","pubdate":"2014-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","pediatrics"],"title":"Posttraumatic Feeding Disorder in Low Birth Weight Young Children: A Nested Case\u2013Control Study of a Home-Based Intervention Program ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/posttraumatic-feeding-disorder-low-birth-weight-young-children-nested-casecontrol-study-homebased-in"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4373405,"mean":4.8671827328057,"rank":3181603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":958214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4373405,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105843,"mean":7.2535276166361,"rank":77022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":23427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105843,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230,"mean":2.5162532751092,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.2333333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
