As even relatively small melanomas may have metastatic potential, accurate assessment of progression is critical. Although diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma is usually based on histopathologic criteria, these criteria may at times be inadequate in differentiating melanoma from certain types of benign nevi. As for prognosis, tumor (Breslow) thickness, mitotic rate, and ulceration have been considered the most important prognostic indicators among histopathologic criteria. However, there are cases of thin primary melanomas that have ultimately developed metastases despite complete excision. Given this, an accurate assessment of melanoma progression is critical, and development of molecular biomarkers that identify high-risk melanoma in its early phase is urgently needed. Large-scale genomic profiling has identified considerable heterogeneity in melanoma and suggests subgrouping of tumors by patterns of gene expression and mutation will ultimately be essential to accurate staging. This subgrouping in turn may allow for more targeted therapy. In this review, we aim to provide an update on the most promising new biomarkers that may help in the identification and prognostication of melanoma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6083cf058f610006970","authors":["Ossama Abbas","Daniel D Miller","Jag Bhawan"],"doi":"10.1097\/dad.0b013e31828a2ec5","first_seen_on":"2014-05-08T10:02:34+00:00","issns":["1533-0311","0193-1091"],"issue":"5","journal":"The American Journal of Dermatopathology","last_mentioned_on":1420110119,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24803061?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/amjdermatopathology\/Abstract\/2014\/05000\/Cutaneous_Malignant_Melanoma__Update_on_Diagnostic.1.aspx"],"pmid":"24803061","pubdate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology","dermatology"],"title":"Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma: Update on Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cutaneous-malignant-melanoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":2096048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2482812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109163,"mean":7.9663112621609,"rank":44128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":61610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109163,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":567,"mean":1.1998303886926,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":567,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.3271304347826,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/status\/464344385044226049","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2335400],"posted_on":"2014-05-08T10:01:43+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":58},"tweet_id":"464344385044226049"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/memoalexlope\/status\/464353941619105792","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2335400],"posted_on":"2014-05-08T10:39:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Guillermo Lopez C","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1511285875\/45150_485611673153_796953153_6804721_3991610_n_normal.jpg","description":"M\u00e9dico Anatomopatologo.
