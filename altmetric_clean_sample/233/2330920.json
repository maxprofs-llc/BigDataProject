The catalytic protocol features high activities and selectivities to target products; compatibility with a variety of substrates, including aliphatic amines and secondary amines; and the possibility to efficiently and selectively promote amine cross-coupling reactions. A high stability and recyclability of the catalyst is also observed under the investigated conditions. Insights into the reaction mechanism indicate the formation of a superoxide species able to efficiently promote oxidative couplings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Qiu, Xuan","Len, Christophe","Luque, Rafael","Li, Yingwei"],"doi":"10.1002\/cssc.201301340","endpage":"1688","first_seen_on":"2014-05-06T20:19:08+00:00","issns":["1864-564X","1864-5631"],"issue":"6","journal":"ChemSusChem","last_mentioned_on":1399407534,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201301340\/abstract;jsessionid=22394920E5026B3B1E773DE9F6B95808.f03t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201301340\/pdf","pmid":"24801486","pubdate":"2014-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Materials Science","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1684","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Solventless Oxidative Coupling of Amines to Imines by Using Transition\u2010Metal\u2010Free MetalOrganic Frameworks","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/solventless-oxidative-coupling-amines-imines-using-transitionmetalfree-metalorganic-frameworks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6306418,"mean":5.9759110537734,"rank":4659872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6306418,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142922,"mean":7.7318745320843,"rank":94676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":26550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142922,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":482,"mean":4.1015093555094,"rank":235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":482,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.346,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
