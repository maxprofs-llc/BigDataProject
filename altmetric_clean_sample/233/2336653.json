We show here that in the heart, c-kit is expressed not only by cardiac stem cells but also by cardiomyocytes, commencing immediately after birth and terminating a few days later, coincident with the onset of cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation. To examine the function of c-kit in cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation, we used compound heterozygous mice carrying the W (null) and W(v) (dominant negative) mutations of c-kit. In vivo, adult W\/W(v) cardiomyocytes are phenotypically indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts. After acute pressure overload adult W\/W(v) cardiomyocytes reenter the cell cycle and proliferate, leading to left ventricular growth; furthermore in transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted overexpression of the dominant negative W(v) mutant, pressure overload causes cardiomyocytes to reenter the cell cycle. In contrast, in wild-type mice left ventricular growth after pressure overload results mainly from cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Importantly, W\/W(v) mice with pressure overload-induced cardiomyocyte hyperplasia had improved left ventricular function and survival. In W\/W(v) mice, c-kit dysfunction also resulted in an approximately 14-fold decrease (P<0.01) in the number of c-kit(+)\/GATA4(+) cardiac progenitors. These findings identify novel functions for c-kit: promotion of cardiac stem cell differentiation and regulation of cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ec9","authors":["Ming Li","Nawazish Naqvi","Eiji Yahiro","Ke Liu","Pamela C.
