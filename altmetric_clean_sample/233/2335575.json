BI2536-treated spermatocytes persisted in a pro-metaphase state without dividing and had condensed chromosomes that did not separate. Centrosomes failed to recruit \u03b3-tubulin and centrosomin (Cnn) and were not associated with microtubule arrays that were abnormal and did not form proper bipolar spindles. Centrioles, which usually separate during the anaphase of the first meiosis, remained held together in a V-shaped configuration suggesting that Polo kinase regulates the proteolysis that breaks centriole linkage to ensure their disengagement. Despite these defects spermatid differentiation proceeds, leading to axoneme formation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e17","authors":["Maria G Riparbelli","Marco Gottardo","David M Glover","Giuliano Callaini","Riparbelli, Maria G","Gottardo, Marco","Glover, David M","Callaini, Giuliano","David M.
