However, its function, especially how deubiquitinating enzymes balance the NF-\u03baB activation, remains largely elusive in invertebrates. Investigating bbtA20 and its binding proteins, bbt A20-binding inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (bbtABIN1) and bbtABIN2, in Chinese amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtauense, we found that bbtABIN2 can colocalize and compete with bbt TNF receptor-associated factor 6 to connect the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, whereas bbtABIN1 physically links bbtA20 to bbt NF-\u03baB essential modulator (bbtNEMO) to facilitate the K48-linked ubiquitination of bbtNEMO. Similar to human A20, bbtA20 is a dual enzyme that removes the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains and builds the K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on bbt receptor-interacting serine\/threonine protein kinase 1b, leading to the inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling. Our study not only suggests that ubiquitination is an ancient strategy in regulating NF-\u03baB activation but also provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, for ABINs\/A20-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB via modifying the ubiquitinated proteins in a basal chordate, adding information on the stepwise development of vertebrate innate immune signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Shaochun Yuan","Xiangru Dong","Xin Tao","Liqun Xu","Jie Ruan","Jian Peng","Anlong Xu"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1321187111","first_seen_on":"2014-05-06T23:54:50+00:00","issns":["1091-6490"],"issue":"18","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1411948800,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/18\/6720.long","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1321187111"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/18\/6720.full.pdf","pmid":"24753567","pubdate":"2014-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"6720","subjects":["science"],"title":"Emergence of the A20\/ABIN-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling via modifying the ubiquitinated proteins in a basal chordate","type":"article","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emergence-a20abinmediated-inhibition-nfb-signaling-via-modifying-ubiquitinated-proteins-basal-chorda"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":1990007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107874,"mean":7.6884201792851,"rank":43456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":61771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107874,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37411,"mean":15.294872440524,"rank":24171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":12607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37411,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":971,"mean":41.92270927835,"rank":690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":971,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
