We have recently shown that activating Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) while specifically blocking signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in leukemic cells enhances their immunogenicity, allowing for CD8(+) T cell-mediated tumor eradication. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of such a \"Push & Release\" strategy against hematological malignancies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"536246132a83ee225b8b4590","authors":["Marcin Kortylewski","Ya-Huei Kuo","Kortylewski M","Kuo YH"],"doi":"10.4161\/onci.27441","first_seen_on":"2014-05-08T09:16:05+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["2162-4011","2162-402X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control, with Measurement + Control","last_mentioned_on":1399540548,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24800162"],"pmcid":"PMC4006856","pmid":"24800162","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","startpage":"e27441","title":"Push and release: TLR9 activation plus STAT3 blockade for systemic antitumor immunity.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/push-release"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3067701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":945204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107685,"mean":7.7144315590062,"rank":73141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":23912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107685,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":401,"mean":1.568245,"rank":218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":401,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.95555555555556,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/biodomtomi\/status\/464332831515508736","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2335316],"posted_on":"2014-05-08T09:15:48+00:00","author":{"name":"biodomtomi","url":"http:\/\/domtomi.tumblr.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/428835940014882816\/yqRTFI6Y_normal.jpeg","description":"Science, food & wine, business, pharma","id_on_source":"biodomtomi","tweeter_id":"606189490","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":84},"tweet_id":"464332831515508736"}]}}
