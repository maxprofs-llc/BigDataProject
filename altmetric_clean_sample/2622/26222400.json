Dose-dependent effects on liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression were examined in male and female mice gavaged with TCDD every 4 days for 28 or 92 days. RNA-seq data revealed the coordinated repression of 181 genes predominately expressed in the liver including albumin (3.7-fold), \u03b1-fibrinogen (14.5-fold), and \u03b2-fibrinogen (17.4-fold) in males with corresponding AhR enrichment at 2 hr. Liver-specific genes exhibiting sexually dimorphic expression also demonstrated diminished divergence between sexes. For example, male-biased Gstp1 was repressed 3.0-fold in males and induced 4.5-fold in females, which were confirmed at the protein level. Disrupted regulation is consistent with impaired GHR-JAK2-STAT5 signaling and inhibition of female specific CUX2-mediated transcription as well as the repression of other key transcriptional regulators including Ghr, Stat5b, Bcl6, Hnf4a, Hnf6, Foxa1\/2\/3, and Zhx2. Attenuated liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression was concurrent with the induction of fetal genes such as alpha-fetoprotein. The results suggest AhR activation causes the loss of liver-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression producing a functionally \"de-differentiated\" hepatic phenotype.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Rance Nault","Kelly A.
