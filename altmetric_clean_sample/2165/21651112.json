Here, we report a self-powered and high sensitive acceleration sensor based on triboelectric nanogenerator composed of liquid metal mercury droplet (LMMD) and nanofiber-networked polyvinylidene fluoride (nn-PVDF) film. Due to the ultrahigh surface-to-volume ratio of nn-PVDF film and high surface tension, high mass density, high elastic as well as mechanical robustness of LMMD, the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current reach up to 15.5 V and 300 nA at the acceleration of 60 m\/s2, respectively. The acceleration sensor has a wide detection range from 0 to 60 m\/s2 with a high sensitivity of 0.26 V\u2022s\/m2. Also, the output voltage and current show negligible decrease over 200 000 cycles, evidently presenting excellent stability. Moreover, a high speed camera was employed to dynamically capture the motion state of the acceleration sensor for insight into the corresponding work mechanism. Finally, the acceleration sensor was demonstrated to measure the vibration of mechanical equipment and human motion in real time, which has potential application in equipment vibration monitoring and troubleshooting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Binbin Zhang","Lei Zhang","Weili Deng","Long Jin","Fengjun Chun","Hong Pan","Bingni Gu","Haitao Zhang","Zekai Lv","Weiqing Yang","Zhong Lin Wang"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.7b03818","first_seen_on":"2017-07-08T13:50:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-0851","1936-086X"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1499515389,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1021\/acsnano.7b03818"],"pmid":"28671813","pubdate":"2017-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Self-Powered Acceleration Sensor Based on Liquid Metal Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Vibration Monitoring","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfpowered-acceleration-sensor-based-liquid-metal-triboelectric-nanogenerator-vibration-monitoring-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177940,"mean":6.9186814093318,"rank":1174437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6929162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177940,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176221,"mean":11.443179695835,"rank":34735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":140402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176221,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4983,"mean":11.957092733842,"rank":1619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4983,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":21.518493506494,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
