In combination with the lower serum T3 concentration caused by fasting, the decrease in receptor content results in a marked decrease in nuclear T3-receptor complexes. The changes in T3 receptor content and circulating T3 in fasted animals appear to be independent synergistic adaptations for caloric conservation in the fasted state. Unlike changes in hormonal level, the modification of nuclear receptor content provides a mechanism that may protect cells with a low caloric reserve independently of the metabolic status of the whole animal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Schussler, G C","Orlando, J"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-08T13:13:52+00:00","issns":["0036-8075"],"issue":"4329","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1419447600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/204004"],"pmid":"204004","pubdate":"1978-02-10T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Fasting decreases triiodothyronine receptor capacity.","type":"article","volume":"199"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8025465,"mean":6.7961103173558,"rank":897868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7082398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8025465,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105026,"mean":10.779997543442,"rank":16560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":88277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105026,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40745,"mean":32.458831631651,"rank":15399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":24936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40745,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":487,"mean":59.697884773663,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":487,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"The Effect of Ketogenic Diets on Thyroid Hormones","url":"http:\/\/www.ketotic.org\/2014\/12\/the-effect-of-ketogenic-diets-on.html","citation_ids":[3706889,4154298,2993812,21650088,4425820,1410749,3713050,947064,3768705,813692,16707965,417286,2508329],"posted_on":"2014-12-24T19:00:00+00:00","summary":"The previous generation of myths about low carb diets were focused on organ systems.
