All participants who engaged themselves in specific, regular training of 30 hours a week during the competitive season were included in the study. Participants consumed the supplement and the placebo for 4 weeks. The damaging exercise consisted of 100 consecutive drop-jumps. Pre and post supplementation readings of the criterion variables, highly sensitive C reactive protein (hs-cRP), creatine Kinase (CK), myeloperoxidase (MPO), isometric muscle strength, maximum aerobic capacity (VO2 max), heart rate (HR) and muscle soreness were obtained at baseline (Day 1), at 24 hours (Day 2) and at 48 hours (Day 3) following EIMD.\nDifferences were observed in pre and post supplementation values (P < 0.05) indicating the effectiveness of soy protein in attenuating muscle damage and enhancing muscle recovery.\nOur findings suggest that soy protein; a vegetable based supplement is effective, in ameliorating the negative effects of EIMD in trained athletic population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6793cf058f610009757","authors":["Shweta Shenoy","Mrinal Dhawan","Jaspal Singh Sandhu"],"doi":"10.5812\/asjsm.33528","first_seen_on":"2017-03-26T00:26:37+00:00","issns":["2008-000X","2008-7209"],"issue":"3","journal":"Asian Journal of Sports Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1490728923,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27826398"],"pmid":"27826398","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Four Weeks of Supplementation With Isolated Soy Protein Attenuates Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage and Enhances Muscle Recovery in Well Trained Athletes: A Randomized Trial","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.asjsm.com\/?page=article&article_id=33528","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/four-weeks-supplementation-isolated-soy-protein-attenuates-exerciseinduced-muscle-damage-enhances-mu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.65,"score_history":{"1y":5.65,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":1519649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6903384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248339,"mean":13.315533281253,"rank":63108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":185049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248339,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":6.8271007751938,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
