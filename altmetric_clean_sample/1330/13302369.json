In this article I offer the alternative positive proposal that \"the self\" may indeed refer to a physical\/computational system within the brain. To do this, I draw on empirical work regarding the neural basis of consciousness and decision-making, and on philosophical work regarding ecological control, unified group perspectives, and functional\/mechanistic explanation. The work I review jointly supports the conclusion that a \"core-circuit\" of interacting cortical regions - the global workspace network - can be understood as a unified system for consciously perceiving and deciding, and thus fulfills many of the roles intuitively assigned to the self. I conclude that this self-concept need not be mistaken given current empirical knowledge.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000378d","authors":["Smith, Ryan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.concog.2016.10.007","first_seen_on":"2016-11-03T10:11:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10538100","1090-2376"],"journal":"Consciousness & Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1478991538,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1053810016303774"],"pmid":"27810727","pubdate":"2016-11-05T22:28:07+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"A neuro-cognitive defense of the unified self","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neurocognitive-defense-unified-self"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":3412929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4194768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234367,"mean":12.811446660352,"rank":105354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":125745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234367,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":969,"mean":12.820208677686,"rank":613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":969,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":7.7766,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
