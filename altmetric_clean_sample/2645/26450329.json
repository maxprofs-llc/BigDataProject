However, the mechanisms for coordination between Fe-S cluster assembly, FBXL5, and IRP1\/IRP2 activity are poorly defined. A new study reveals that FBXL5 plays a critical role in limiting IRP1 and IRP2 overaccumulation when cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly is impaired in order to maintain optimal iron levels for cell viability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Caryn E.
