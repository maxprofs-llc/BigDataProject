Some of the mechanisms of the development of sarcopenia including insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction are also associated with the pathogenesis of DM. Sarcopenia provides the basis for frailty, which is a state that is highly vulnerable to stressors, and can lead to disability, dependency and mortality, and older DM patients are often in a state of frailty. Given the background of an increasing number of older DM patients, the screening and early detection of sarcopenia\/frailty and appropriate intervention would be expected to improve the prognosis and quality of life in older patients.
