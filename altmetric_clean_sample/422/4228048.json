It is also an opportunistic pathogen now causing an increasing number of nosocomial infections. The treatment of S. maltophilia is quite difficult given its intrinsic resistance to a number of antibiotics, and because it is able to acquire new resistances via horizontal gene transfer and mutations. Certainly, strains resistant to quinolones, cotrimoxale and\/or cephalosporins-antibiotics commonly used to treat S. maltophilia infections-have emerged. The increasing number of available S. maltophilia genomes has allowed the identification and annotation of a large number of antimicrobial resistance genes. Most encode inactivating enzymes and efflux pumps, but information on their role in intrinsic and acquired resistance is limited. Non-typical antibiotic resistance mechanisms that also form part of the intrinsic resistome have been identified via mutant library screening. These include non-typical antibiotic resistance genes, such as bacterial metabolism genes, and non-inheritable resistant phenotypes, such as biofilm formation and persistence. Their relationships with resistance are complex and require further study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["S\u00e1nchez, Mar\u00eda Blanca"],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00658","first_seen_on":"2015-06-30T13:19:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1437042185,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00658\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26175724?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26175724?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fmicb.2015.00658\/pdf","pmid":"26175724","pubdate":"2015-06-30T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Antibiotic resistance in the opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibiotic-resistance-opportunistic-pathogen-stenotrophomonas-maltophilia-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5361876,"mean":6.2737966614312,"rank":2474916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2752520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5361876,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187607,"mean":8.4413005980621,"rank":85746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":95305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187607,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4012,"mean":3.4651458489155,"rank":1692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4012,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":339,"mean":2.966124260355,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":339,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
