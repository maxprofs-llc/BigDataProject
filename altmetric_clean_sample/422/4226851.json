This investigation explored the role of the renal innervation in mediating deranged baroreflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and renal excretory function in cisplatin-induced renal failure. Methods: Rats were either intact or bilaterally renally denervated 4 days prior to receiving cisplatin (5 mg\/kg i.p.) and entered a chronic metabolic study for 8 days. At day 8, other groups of rats were prepared for acute measurement of RSNA or renal function with either intact or denervated kidneys. Results: Following the cisplatin challenge, creatinine clearance was 50% lower while fractional sodium excretion and renal cortical and medullary TGF-\u03b21 concentrations were 3-4 fold higher in both intact and renally denervated rats compared to control rats. In cisplatin-treated rats, the maximal gain of the high-pressure baroreflex curve was only 20% that of control rats, but following renal denervation not different from that of renally denervated control rats. Volume expansion reduced RSNA by 50% in control and in cisplatin-treated rats but only following bilateral renal denervation. The volume expansion mediated natriuresis\/diuresis was absent in the cisplatin-treated rats but was normalized following renal denervation. Conclusions: Cisplatin-induced renal injury impaired renal function and caused a sympatho-excitation with blunting of high and low pressure baroreflex regulation of RSNA, which was dependent on the renal innervation. It is suggested that in man with CKD there is a dysregulation of the neural control of the kidney mediated by its sensory innervation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc19","authors":["Johns, Edward James","Goulding, Niamh E"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphys.2015.00192","first_seen_on":"2015-06-30T08:29:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-042X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1435665892,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphys.2015.00192\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphys.2015.00192\/pdf","pmid":"26175693","pubdate":"2015-06-30T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Neural regulation of the kidney function in rats with cisplatin induced renal failure","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neural-regulation-kidney-function-rats-cisplatin-induced-renal-failure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5296333,"mean":6.2229932036005,"rank":4410277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5296333,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186796,"mean":8.4238253379375,"rank":150619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186796,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1875,"mean":4.0245218783351,"rank":1158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1875,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":4.0297066666667,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontPhysiol\/status\/615799322802655232","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4226851],"posted_on":"2015-06-30T08:29:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Physiol","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Physiology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533286083207766016\/8U7NEYhH_normal.jpeg","description":"Frontiers in Physiology is the largest open-access journal in the field of Physiology.","id_on_source":"FrontPhysiol","tweeter_id":"397339470","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":2029},"tweet_id":"615799322802655232"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontPhysiol\/status\/615853505492946944","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4226851],"posted_on":"2015-06-30T12:04:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Physiol","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Physiology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533286083207766016\/8U7NEYhH_normal.jpeg","description":"Frontiers in Physiology is the largest open-access journal in the field of Physiology.","id_on_source":"FrontPhysiol","tweeter_id":"397339470","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":2029},"tweet_id":"615853505492946944"}]}}
