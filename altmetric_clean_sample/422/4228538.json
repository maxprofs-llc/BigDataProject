Twenty-two urban schools and N\u00a0=\u00a0435 low-income racial\/ethnic minority students were enrolled in the study and received intervention services across the course of 2\u00a0years, in both kindergarten and first grade. Intervention effects on math and reading achievement were larger for students enrolled in schools with lower overall levels of leadership, accountability, and safety\/respect at baseline. Program impacts on disruptive behaviors were greater in schools with lower levels of accountability at baseline; impacts on sustained attention were greater in schools with lower levels of safety\/respect at baseline. Implications for Social-Emotional Learning program implementation, replication, and scale-up are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f5","authors":["Meghan P.
