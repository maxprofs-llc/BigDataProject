Abst #KTCG"],"citation":{"abstract":"Conjoined twins represent a great challenge for most pediatric specialists including pediatric surgeons, anesthetists, neonatologists, urologists, neurosurgeons, and orthopedic surgeons. This anomaly can be classified according to the type of twins\u05f3 fusion. Various organs can be fused making the separation difficult. Conjoined twins are usually diagnosed antenatally by ultrasound. Detailed fetal echocardiography is necessary to counsel the parents during pregnancy. Postnatally, the majority of the conjoined twins can be thoroughly investigated using various imaging techniques. This allows careful planning of the operation. However, in approximately one-third of the patients an urgent operation is required at birth without a complete assessment of the joining. This is associated with a poorer outcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088fd","authors":["Pierro, Agostino","Kiely, Edward M","Spitz, Lewis"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.sempedsurg.2015.06.003","first_seen_on":"2015-06-30T00:30:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1055-8586","1532-9453"],"issue":"5","journal":"Seminars in Pediatric Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1435624200,"links":["http:\/\/www.sempedsurg.org\/article\/S1055-8586(15)00067-0\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sempedsurg.org\/article\/S1055858615000670\/pdf","pmid":"26382257","pubdate":"2015-09-19T22:00:49+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pediatrics"],"title":"Classification and clinical evaluation","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/classification-clinical-evaluation-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5291966,"mean":6.2215335660784,"rank":4406746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5291966,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186727,"mean":8.4240930240032,"rank":150564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186727,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":1.9404807692308,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.0833333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
