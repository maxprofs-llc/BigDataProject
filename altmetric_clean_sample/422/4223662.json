This report examines mitochondrial function and content in trophoblasts supplemented with selenium.\nSwan-71, JEG-3 and BeWo cells and placental tissue were incubated with sodium selenite or selenomethionine. Mitochondrial function was examined in a respirometer. Mitochondrial content was determined using RT-PCR. The levels of the mitochondrial biogenesis markers selenoprotein H, PGC-1\u03b1 and NRF-1 was examined by western blotting.\nMitochondrial respiration was significantly enhanced post selenium supplementation in cells and tissues. Selenium supplementation increased mitochondrial content and up-regulated mitochondrial biogenesis mediators in cells.\nThese results emphasise the importance of selenium in mitochondrial regeneration in trophoblasts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008eed","authors":["Khera, Alisha","Dong, Lan-Feng","Holland, Olivia","Vanderlelie, Jessica","Pasdar, Elham A","Neuzil, Jiri","Perkins, Anthony V"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.placenta.2015.06.010","first_seen_on":"2015-06-29T11:03:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0143-4004","1532-3102"],"journal":"Placenta","last_mentioned_on":1464186530,"links":["http:\/\/www.placentajournal.org\/article\/S0143-4004(15)30001-1\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26154583","http:\/\/www.placentajournal.org\/article\/S0143-4004(15)30001-1\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&amp;elsca2=email&amp;elsca3=0143-4004_201508_36_8_&amp;elsca4=Obstetrics%20and%20Gynecology%7CNeonatology\/Perinatology","http:\/\/www.placentajournal.org\/article\/S0143-4004%2815%2930001-1\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&amp%3Belsca2=email&amp%3Belsca3=0143-4004_201508_36_8_&amp%3Belsca4=Obstetrics+and+Gynecology%7CNeonatology%2FPerinatology"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.placentajournal.org\/article\/S0143400415300011\/pdf","pmid":"26154583","pubdate":"2015-07-11T19:41:31+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["obstetrics","embryology","physiology"],"title":"Selenium supplementation induces mitochondrial biogenesis in trophoblasts","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selenium-supplementation-induces-mitochondrial-biogenesis-trophoblasts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7757128,"mean":6.6329627680391,"rank":3805762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3753548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7757128,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227643,"mean":8.0881994271708,"rank":110776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":107297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227643,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":927,"mean":1.9260993520518,"rank":247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":927,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.7392857142857,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
