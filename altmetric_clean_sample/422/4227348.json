Water samples were collected from primary sedimentation tank inlet, aeration tank, final sedimentation tank overflow outlet, and disinfection tank. Enterococcal strains were determined their vancomycin susceptibility by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test. Vancomycin-resistance genes (vanA and vanB) were quantified by real-time PCR. The sewage treatment process indeed decreased the number of most enterococci contained in the entering sewage, with a removal rate of \u22655log. The MIC test showed that two enterococcal strains resistant to a high concentration of vancomycin (>128\u00a0\u03bcg mL(-1)). However, most of the enterococcal strains exhibited sensitivity to vancomycin, indicating that VRE were virtually absent in the sewage treatment systems. On the other hand, vancomycin-resistance genes were detected in all the sewage samples, including those collected from the chlorination disinfection tank. The highest copy numbers of vanA (1.5 \u00d7 10(3) copies mL(-1)) and vanB (1.0 \u00d7 10(3) copies mL(-1)) were detected from the water sample of effluent water and chlorinated water, respectively. Therefore, antibiotic resistance genes remain in the sewage treatment plant and might discharged into water environments such as rivers and coastal areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ce3cf058f61000061c","authors":["Furukawa, Takashi","Hashimoto, Reina","Mekata, Tohru"],"doi":"10.1080\/10934529.2015.1038150","first_seen_on":"2015-06-30T10:32:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-4117"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Environmental Science & Health, Part A: Toxic\/Hazardous Substances & Environmental Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1435661944,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26121014?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26121014?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26121014","pubdate":"2015-06-30T22:04:58+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Quantification of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and corresponding resistance genes in a sewage treatment plant.","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantification-vancomycinresistant-enterococci-corresponding-resistance-genes-sewage-treatment-plant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5296399,"mean":6.2230054757991,"rank":2627867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2509405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5296399,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186796,"mean":8.4237971251908,"rank":93661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":84906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186796,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":2.2501472392638,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.82083333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
