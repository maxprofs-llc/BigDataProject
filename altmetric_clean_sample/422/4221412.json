From January 2013 to February 2014,811 subjects were enrolled in a community-based cohort study from the northeastern region of Taiwan. All subjects received a demographic survey and blood tests, including an H. pylori antibody test, liver biochemistry tests, lipid profiles, sugar\/insulin levels for Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR index), and measurements of adipokines and inflammatory cytokines. A total of 264 men and 547 women were included in this study. The mean age was 59.2 \u00b1 12.7 years. Subjects seropositive for H. pylori antibodies exhibited higher rates of hypertension, an increased incidence of a HOMA-IR index > 2.5 and a higher level of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 than those without H. pylori antibodies. We found a significant difference in the presence of H. pylori antibodies between subjects with MS and those without MS (76.7% vs. 53.7%, p = 0.007) among subjects < 50 y\/o. A HOMA-IR index >2.5, H. pylori antibody presence and leptin were predictors for MS in subjects < 50 y\/o. The estimated odds ratio of MS for a subject with H. pylori antibodies was 3.717 (95% CI = 1.086-12.719) times that of a subject without H. pylori antibodies. In addition, no difference in H. pylori antibody status was detected for MS prediction in subjects that were \u2267 50 y\/o (p = 0.861). In conclusion, subjects with H. pylori antibodies had a higher incidence of a HOMA-IR >2.5 than those without H pylori antibodies. For subjects aged < 50 y\/o, the H. pylori antibody was a predictor for MS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Li-Wei Chen","Chih-Yi Chien","Kai-Jie Yang","Sheng-Fong Kuo","Chih-Hung Chen","Rong-Nan Chien"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0128671","first_seen_on":"2015-06-28T12:13:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1435712194,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0128671","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0128671"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0128671.PDF","pmid":"26020514","pubdate":"2015-05-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":" Helicobacter pylori  Infection Increases Insulin Resistance and Metabolic Syndrome in Residents Younger than 50 Years Old: A Community-Based Study","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/helicobacter-pylori-infection-increases-insulin-resistance-metabolic-syndrome-residents-younger-50-y-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5302459,"mean":6.2251135100008,"rank":2089203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3180309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5302459,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186675,"mean":8.4420489945039,"rank":68671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":116458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186675,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92789,"mean":9.518555977066,"rank":34670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":57499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92789,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6364,"mean":8.5502637120855,"rank":2366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6364,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
