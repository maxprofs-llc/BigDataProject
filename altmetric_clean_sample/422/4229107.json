Recent evidence suggests that polarized axonal sorting of \u03b2-site converting enzyme 1 (BACE1), a type I transmembrane aspartyl protease involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, entails an unusual journey. In hippocampal neurons, BACE1 internalized from dendrites is conveyed in recycling endosomes via unidirectional retrograde transport towards the soma and sorted to axons where BACE1 becomes enriched. In comparison to other transmembrane proteins that undergo transcytosis or elimination in somatodendritic compartment, vectorial transport of internalized BACE1 in dendrites is unique and intriguing. Dysfunction of protein transport contributes to pathogenesis of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, characterization of BACE1 transcytosis is an important addition to the multiple lines of evidence that highlight the crucial role played by endosomal trafficking pathway as well as axonal sorting mechanisms in AD pathogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cb","authors":["Buggia\u2010Pr\u00e9vot, Virginie","Thinakaran, Gopal"],"doi":"10.1002\/bies.201500019","endpage":"898","first_seen_on":"2015-06-30T20:05:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-1878"],"issue":"8","journal":"BioEssays","last_mentioned_on":1436737964,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.201500019\/abstract;jsessionid=43F5F3B1FF922E183DCF48E919D0BCB1.f01t04","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26126792?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26126792","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.201500019\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.201500019\/pdf","pmid":"26126792","pubdate":"2015-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"888","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","biology"],"title":"Significance of transcytosis in Alzheimer's disease: BACE1 takes the scenic route to axons","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/significance-transcytosis-alzheimers-disease-bace1-takes-scenic-route-axons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6399769,"mean":5.9838482607491,"rank":379161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":6019982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6399769,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188829,"mean":8.4997519117928,"rank":17696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":171092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188829,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1147,"mean":5.3269319371728,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1147,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":5.08525,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
