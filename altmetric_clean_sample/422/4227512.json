Reduced mTORC1 signaling is associated with life span extension and improved metabolic homeostasis, yet the downstream targets that mediate these benefits are unclear. Here, we demonstrated that enhanced 4E-BP1 activity in mouse skeletal muscle protects against age- and diet-induced insulin resistance and metabolic rate decline. Transgenic animals displayed increased energy expenditure; altered adipose tissue distribution, including reduced white adipose accumulation and preserved brown adipose mass; and were protected from hepatic steatosis. Skeletal muscle-specific 4E-BP1 mediated metabolic protection directly through increased translation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) and enhanced respiratory function. Non-cell autonomous protection was through preservation of brown adipose tissue metabolism, which was increased in 4E-BP1 transgenic animals during normal aging and in a response to diet-induced type 2 diabetes. Adipose phenotypes may derive from enhanced skeletal muscle expression and secretion of the known myokine FGF21. Unlike skeletal muscle, enhanced adipose-specific 4E-BP1 activity was not protective but instead was deleterious in response to the same challenges. These findings indicate that regulation of 4E-BP1 in skeletal muscle may serve as an important conduit through which mTORC1 controls metabolism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cff","authors":["Tsai, Shihyin","Sitzmann, Joanna M","Dastidar, Somasish G","Rodriguez, Ariana A","Vu, Stephanie L","McDonald, Circe E","Academia, Emmeline C","O'Leary, Monique N","Ashe, Travis D","La Spada, Albert R","Kennedy, Brian K"],"doi":"10.1172\/jci77361","first_seen_on":"2015-06-30T10:55:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1558-8238","0021-9738"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1436162198,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26121750","http:\/\/www.jci.org\/articles\/view\/77361","https:\/\/www.jci.org\/articles\/view\/77361","http:\/\/www.jci.org\/articles\/view\/77361\/figure\/1","http:\/\/www.jci.org\/articles\/view\/77361#.VZWs3-dsIss.twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1172\/JCI77361"],"pmid":"26121750","pubdate":"2015-06-30T22:00:36+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Muscle-specific 4E-BP1 signaling activation improves metabolic parameters during aging and obesity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/musclespecific-4ebp1-signaling-activation-improves-metabolic-parameters-during-aging-obesity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5320841,"mean":6.2377212094336,"rank":469341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4850665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5320841,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187116,"mean":8.4306014483073,"rank":23966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":163094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187116,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4888,"mean":11.435624718641,"rank":1261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":3627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4888,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":14.123433628319,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":6,"practitioner":4,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
