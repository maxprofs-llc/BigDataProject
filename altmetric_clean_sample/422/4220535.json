The novel aldo-keto reductase Tm1743 from Thermotoga maritima was identified to have a broad substrate specificity and high thermostability, serving as an important enzyme in biocatalysis and fine-chemical synthesis. In this study, Tm1743 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells with an N-terminal His6 tag and was purified by Ni(2+)-chelating affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Purified recombinant enzyme was incubated with its cofactor NADP(+) and its substrate ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate (EOPB) for crystallization. Two X-ray diffraction data sets were collected at 2.0 and 1.7\u2005\u00c5 resolution from dodecahedral crystals grown from samples containing Tm1743-NADP(+)-EOPB and Tm1743-NADP(+), respectively. Both crystals belonged to space group P3121, with similar unit-cell parameters. However, in the refined structure model only NADP(+) was observed in the active site of the full-length Tm1743 enzyme. Degradation of the N-terminal vector-derived amino acids during crystallization was confirmed by Western blot and mass-spectrometric analyses.","authors":["Hou, H.","Hou, H.","Li, R.","Wang, X.","Yuan, Z.","Liu, X.","Chen, Z.","Xu, X."],"doi":"10.1107\/s2053230x15009735","first_seen_on":"2015-06-28T00:01:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2053-230X"],"issue":"Pt 7","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section F: Structural Biology Communications","last_mentioned_on":1436266623,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2053230X15009735=","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26144229?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/f\/issues\/2015\/07\/00\/ic5091\/ic5091.pdf","pmid":"26144229","pubdate":"2015-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Crystallographic analysis of a novel aldo-keto reductase from Thermotoga maritima in complex with NADP(.)","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystallographic-analysis-novel-aldoketo-reductase-ithermotoga-maritimai-complex-nadp-supsup"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
