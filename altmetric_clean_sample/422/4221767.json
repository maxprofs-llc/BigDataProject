The diagnosis of liver fluke infection (opisthorchiasis) was confirmed by the detection of the characteristic eggs of Opisthorchis viverrini in stool microscopy. The patient was treated with praziquantel. Opisthorchiasis is a common parasitic disease and major public health problem in Southeast Asia and in Eastern Europe.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a6a","authors":["Lindner, A","Weber, C","Rittweger, M","Stocker, H","Arast\u00e9h, K"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00108-015-3750-8","first_seen_on":"2015-06-28T16:09:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-1289"],"journal":"Der Internist","last_mentioned_on":1435507773,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26116106?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26116106","pubdate":"2015-06-28T22:01:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"General Practice \/ Family Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nephrology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"[A 55-year old Thai male patient with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain].","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/akute-rechtsseitige-oberbauchschmerzen-bei-einem-55j%C3%A4hrigen-thail%C3%A4ndischen-patienten"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5285691,"mean":6.2167864343182,"rank":4401752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5285691,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186440,"mean":8.435049104533,"rank":150455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186440,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":1.7674259259259,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/status\/615190308368744448","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4221767],"posted_on":"2015-06-28T16:09:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
