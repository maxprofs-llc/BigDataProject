Thus, it seems worthwhile to monitor the changes in genomic DNA copy number of industrial strains. In the present study, we developed an in situ comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to investigate the ploidy and genetic differences between selected industrial yeast strains. The CGH-based system was validated using the laboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains (haploid BY4741 and diploid BY4743). DNA isolated from BY4743 cells was considered a reference DNA. The ploidy and DNA gains and losses of baker's, brewer's and wine strains were revealed. Taken together, the in situ CGH was shown a helpful molecular tool to identify genomic differences between yeast industrial strains. Moreover, the in situ CGH-based system may be used at the single-cell level of analysis to supplement array-based techniques and high-throughput analyses at the population scale.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd3","authors":["Wnuk, Maciej","Panek, Anita","Golec, Ewelina","Magda, Michal","Deregowska, Anna","Adamczyk, Jagoda","Lewinska, Anna"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiotec.2015.06.407","first_seen_on":"2015-06-28T11:26:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4863"],"journal":"Journal of Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1464257349,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26116136?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26116136","pubdate":"2015-06-28T22:01:07+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Genetic profiling of yeast industrial strains using in situ comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-profiling-yeast-industrial-strains-using-situ-comparative-genomic-hybridization-cgh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7811999,"mean":6.6309711159621,"rank":5924336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1045832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7811999,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227169,"mean":8.0926404951403,"rank":157667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":37543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227169,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":955,"mean":3.1653710691824,"rank":548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":955,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.7465555555556,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
