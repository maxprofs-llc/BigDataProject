MiR-21 expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and NOx, and eNOS levels were measured by ELISA assay. CIMT was evaluated by ultrasonography and CIMT\u2009\u2265\u20090.8\u2009mm was accepted as increased CIMT (iCIMT).\nC-reactive protein (CRP) level, plasma miR-21 expression level and CIMT were found to be significantly higher in the hypertension group when compared to the control group (p\u2009=\u20090.009, p\u2009=\u20090.002 and p\u2009<\u20090.001, respectively). NOx and eNOS levels were significantly lower in the hypertension group compared to the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.001, both). MiR-21 level was positively correlated with the clinical systolic blood pressure, clinical diastolic blood pressure, CRP and CIMT. MiR-21 was also negatively correlated with NOx and eNOS. Eighteen patients with hypertension had iCIMT. MiR-21 and CRP levels were significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.001), whereas NOx and eNOS levels were significantly lower in patients with iCIMT (p\u2009<\u20090.001, both).\nThe decreased levels of NOx and eNOS found in this study indicate the co-existence of endothelial dysfunction and hypertension once more. In the absence of microalbuminuria, the increased miR-21 expression in patients with iCIMT made us conclude that this miRNA might be involved in the early stages of atherosclerotic process in hypertensive patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003a7e","authors":["Cengiz, Mahir","Yavuzer, Serap","K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7k\u0131ran Avc\u0131, Bur\u00e7ak","Y\u00fcr\u00fcyen, Mehmet","Yavuzer, Hakan","Dikici, S\u00fcleyman Atilla","Karata\u015f, \u00d6mer Faruk","\u00d6zen, Mustafa","Uzun, Hafize","\u00d6ngen, Zeki"],"doi":"10.3109\/10641963.2015.1036064","first_seen_on":"2015-06-27T16:54:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-6006"],"journal":"Clinical & Experimental Hypertension","last_mentioned_on":1435424013,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26114349?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26114349","pubdate":"2015-06-27T22:01:25+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Circulating miR-21 and eNOS in subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with hypertension.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circulating-mir21-enos-subclinical-atherosclerosis-patients-hypertension"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5281486,"mean":6.2131255898695,"rank":4398160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5281486,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186286,"mean":8.442855688864,"rank":150387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186286,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":1.7931538461538,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
