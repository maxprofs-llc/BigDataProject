Logistic regression was used to study relationships between preoperative variables and postoperative outcomes.\nThe study population consisted 184 patients, comprising 189 composite resections with reconstruction. Complications developed in 40.2% of the patients. Three patients (1.6%) died, 11.1% returned to the operating room, 5.3% developed donor site complications and 6.9% flap complications of which 3.2% total flap failure. In the multivariable analysis systemic complications were associated with anaesthesia time and hospital stay with red cell transfusion.\nA significant proportion of the patients with primary free flap reconstructions after oral cancer surgery develops postoperative complications. Prolonged anaesthesia time and red cell transfusion are possible predictors for systemic complications and hospital stay respectively. Preoperative screening for risk factors is advocated for patient selection and to have realistic information and expectations.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e02a83eeb12a8b48fa","authors":["Lodders, J-N","Parmar, S","Stienen, N-L-M","Martin, T-J","Karagozoglu, K-H","Heymans, M-W","Nandra, B","Forouzanfar, T"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-28T10:00:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1698-6946"],"journal":"Medicina Oral, Patolog\u00eda Oral y Cirug\u00eda Bucal (Internet)","last_mentioned_on":1472811998,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26116846?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26116846","pubdate":"2015-06-28T22:00:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Incidence and types of complications after ablative oral cancer surgery with primary microvascular free flap reconstruction.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incidence-types-complications-after-ablative-oral-cancer-surgery-primary-microvascular-free-flap-rec-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":7191546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230151,"mean":8.2958003823594,"rank":191968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230151,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":1.7423878787879,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.45,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
