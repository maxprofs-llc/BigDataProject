A hepatobiliary scan utilizing technetium 99m-DISIDA demonstrated a characteristic 'rim sign'; a photopenic defect surrounded by a rim of mildly increased activity immediately adjacent to the gallbladder fossa. The 'rim sign' visualized is thought to be the result of reactive inflammatory findings in the hepatic tissue adjacent to a postoperative abscess within the gallbladder fossa.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a68","authors":["Rodrigue, Paul D","Fakhri, Asif A","Baumgartner, Andrew"],"doi":"10.2967\/jnmt.115.155606","endpage":"296","first_seen_on":"2015-06-29T03:29:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-5675","0091-4916"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of nuclear medicine technology","last_mentioned_on":1473794527,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26111711?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26111711?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26111711","pubdate":"2015-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"295","subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Gallbladder Fossa Abscess Masquerading As Cholecystitis Post Cholecystectomy.","type":"article","volume":"43"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":7237642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231027,"mean":8.310699401799,"rank":192610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231027,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308,"mean":1.1332247557003,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.51,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/status\/615361355349012480","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4222729],"posted_on":"2015-06-29T03:29:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24801},"tweet_id":"615361355349012480"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/statuses\/775776593138507776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4222729],"posted_on":"2016-09-13T19:22:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24801},"tweet_id":"775776593138507776"}]}}
