These transformations were efficiently performed in acetonitrile at room temperature by employing pyridinium triflate as a catalyst. Our new reaction conditions are operationally more practical and broaden the accessibility of various 1,4- and 1,6-dicarbonyl groups, which include diketone, ketoester, and ketothioester functionalities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Joshua A.
