We explored phylogenetic patterns in AMF composition using indicator species analyses (ISA) to find AMF associated to a given habitat (root vs rhizosphere) and soil type. We tested whether the AMF characteristic of different habitats or contrasting soils were more closely related than expected by chance. Then we used principal component analyses and multivariate analyses of variance to test for the relative contribution of each factor to explain the variation in fungal community composition. Finally, we used redundancy analyses to identify the soil properties that significantly explained the differences in AMF communities across soil types. The results pointed out a tendency of AMF communities in roots to be closely related and different from those in the rhizosphere soil. The ISA revealed AMF associated to rhizosphere soil and roots habitat. Soil type also determined the distribution of AMF communities in soils, and this effect could not be attributable to a single soil characteristic, as at least three soil properties related with microbial activity, pH and two micronutrients (Mn and Zn) played a significant role triggering AMF populations.\nArbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities are a main component of soil biota which can determine productivity of the ecosystems. These fungal assemblages vary across host plants and ecosystems, but it is still largely unknown which are the main ecological processes that shape the structure of these communities. A field study in five different soil types from semi-arid areas revealed that AM communities are significantly influenced by habitat (soil vs roots) and soil type. In addition, three soil properties related with microbiological activity, pH, Manganese and Zinc were the main factors triggering the distribution of AM fungi. These results contribute to a better understanding of the ecological factors that can shape AMF communities, an important soil microbial group that affects multiple ecosystems functions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Maria del Mar Alguacil","Maria Pilar Torres","Alicia Montesinos-Navarro","Antonio Rold\u00e1n"],"doi":"10.1128\/aem.03982-15","endpage":"3356","first_seen_on":"2016-04-02T13:38:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1098-5336"],"issue":"11","journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1459187400,"links":["http:\/\/aem.asm.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/22\/AEM.03982-15.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/aem.asm.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/22\/AEM.03982-15.full.pdf","pmid":"27016567","pubdate":"2016-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"AEM.03982-15","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Soil characteristics driving arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities in semiarid Mediterranean soils","type":"article","volume":"82","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/soil-characteristics-driving-arbuscular-mycorrhizal-fungal-communities-semiarid-mediterranean-soils-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7452554,"mean":6.4746174952351,"rank":1340587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6095766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7452554,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272053,"mean":11.142558430006,"rank":67193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":204235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272053,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5245,"mean":6.4190789473684,"rank":986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5245,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":11.789543209877,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
