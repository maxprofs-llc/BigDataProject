We previously reported high glucose activates hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1and downstream gene expression in mesangial cells, leading to an extracellular matrix expansion in the glomeruli. A glucose-responsive transcription factor carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a key mediator for such perturbation of gene regulation. To provide insight into glucose-mediated gene regulation in mesangial cells, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed byDNAmicroarray analysis and identified platelet-derived growth factor-C (PDGF-C) as a novel target gene of ChREBP In streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, glomerular cells showed a significant increase inPDGF-C expression; the ratio ofPDGF-C-positive cells to the total number glomerular cells demonstrated more than threefold increase when compared with control animals. In cultured human mesangial cells, high glucose enhanced expression ofPDGF-C protein by 1.9-fold. Knock-down of ChREBPabrogated this induction response. UpregulatedPDGF-C contributed to the production of typeIVand typeVIcollagen, possibly via an autocrine mechanism. Interestingly, urinaryPDGF-C levels in diabetic model mice were significantly elevated in a fashion similar to urinary albumin. Taken together, we hypothesize that a high glucose-mediated induction ofPDGF-C via ChREBPin mesangial cells contributes to the development of glomerular mesangial expansion in diabetes, which may provide a platform for novel predictive and therapeutic strategies for diabetic nephropathy.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc92a83ee27268b4594","authors":["Kitsunai, Hiroya","Makino, Yuichi","Sakagami, Hidemitsu","Mizumoto, Katsutoshi","Yanagimachi, Tsuyoshi","Atageldiyeva, Kuralay","Takeda, Yasutaka","Fujita, Yukihiro","Abiko, Atsuko","Takiyama, Yumi","Haneda, Masakazu"],"doi":"10.14814\/phy2.12730","first_seen_on":"2016-04-02T14:21:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2051-817X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Physiological Reports","last_mentioned_on":1459637885,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27033449?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27033449","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"e12730","title":"High glucose induces platelet\u2010derived growth factor\u2010C via carbohydrate response element\u2010binding protein in glomerular mesangial cells","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-glucose-induces-plateletderived-growth-factorc-via-carbohydrate-response-elementbinding-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7476637,"mean":6.4841716895094,"rank":5657688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1001163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7476637,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272232,"mean":11.148049435957,"rank":191326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272232,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":777,"mean":5.7433634020619,"rank":614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":777,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":8.4990566037736,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/716260444801880064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6442561],"posted_on":"2016-04-02T13:46:12+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
