Research has identified several pathways in the pathogenesis of CRPC. Several new agents targeting some of these pathways have shown promising data during clinical trials. In the area of androgen depletion, abiraterone acetate and MDV100 have been studied and have shown to decrease prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in phase I and II studies. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody antiangiogenesis agent that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and has shown to decrease PSA levels in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Three agents, ixabepilone, patupilone, and sagopilone, in the class of epothilones (tubulin polymerizing antitumor agents), have shown moderate reductions in PSA levels and moderate adverse effects. The results of ongoing studies with these new treatment agents may offer viable alternatives to the traditional treatment of CRPC to decrease disease progression and improve overall survival.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eba","authors":["Michell B.
