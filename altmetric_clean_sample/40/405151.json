The study compares this cost to the minimum cost of a diet with no limitation on carbohydrate. The rationale for this study is the popularity of the low-carbohydrate diets and their perceived high cost. The method used was an operations research approach to find a set of least cost diets, varying the required carbohydrate. This method was chosen to avoid potential concerns with real diets that may be nutritionally deficient or could be had for a lower cost. The major finding is that the cheapest possible low-carbohydrate diet costs about triple the cost of the cheapest diet with no constraint on carbohydrate. Furthermore, the minimum cost of a diet low in both carbohydrate and fat is 5 to 10 times the cost of the cheapest diet, depending on the relative amounts of these nutrients. As carbohydrate and fat are constrained, cost increases dramatically and nonlinearly. The study identifies which nutrients had the greatest effect on cost for a low-carbohydrate and low-fat diet.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f61000321e","doi":"10.1016\/j.nutres.2007.10.002","first_seen_on":"2011-10-16T13:47:02+00:00","issns":["02715317"],"journal":"Nutrition Research","last_mentioned_on":1318546725,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0271531707002515"],"pmid":"19083381","pubdate":"2008-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"The least-cost low-carbohydrate diet is expensive","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/leastcost-lowcarbohydrate-diet-expensive"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2671203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1694110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70345,"mean":4.6943781701353,"rank":31704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":24304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70345,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":593,"mean":7.9378141891892,"rank":369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":593,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":4.8561538461538,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Mathematics":1,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/erik_arnesen\/status\/124620114422272000","citation_ids":[405151],"posted_on":"2011-10-13T22:58:45+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"erik_arnesen","tweeter_id":45117630},"tweet_id":"124620114422272000"}]}}
