The structural elucidation of the compounds was performed by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data and elemental analyses. The title compounds were obtained by reacting 2-chloro-N-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)acetamide with some substituted phenols. The synthesised compounds were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Candida albicans. The compounds N-(9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-2-(4-ethylphenoxy)acetamide (2c) and N-(9-Ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-2-(quinolin-8-yloxy)acetamide (2n) showed notable antimicrobial activity. The compounds were also studied for their cytotoxic effects using MTT assay, and it was seen that 2n had the lowest cytotoxic activity against NIH\/3T3 cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fd5","authors":["Zafer Asim Kaplancikli","Leyla Yurtta\u015f","G\u00fclhan Turan-Zitouni","Ahmet \u00d6zdemir","Rasime \u00d6zic","\u015eafak Ulusoylar-Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m"],"doi":"10.3109\/14756366.2011.622273","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2011-10-16T03:49:57+00:00","issns":["1475-6366","1475-6374"],"journal":"Journal of Enzyme Inhibition & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1318735622,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/14756366.2011.622273"],"pmid":"21999633","pubdate":"2011-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Synthesis, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of some new carbazole derivatives.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-antimicrobial-activity-cytotoxicity-some-new-carbazole-derivatives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":2899676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65364,"mean":3.8940444900019,"rank":44245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65364,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":422,"mean":0.48479809976247,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":422,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":0.29861111111111,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
