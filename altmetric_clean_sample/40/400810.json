How a single signal induces highly complex temporally controlled networks that ultimately orchestrate physiological processes is unclear. Using an RA-inducible differentiation model, we defined the temporal changes in the genome-wide binding patterns of RAR\u03b3 and RXR\u03b1 and correlated them with transcription regulation. Unexpectedly, both receptors displayed a highly dynamic binding, with different RXR\u03b1 heterodimers targeting identical loci. Comparison of RAR\u03b3 and RXR\u03b1 co-binding at RA-regulated genes identified putative RXR\u03b1-RAR\u03b3 target genes that were validated with subtype-selective agonists. Gene-regulatory decisions during differentiation were inferred from TF-target gene information and temporal gene expression. This analysis revealed six distinct co-expression paths of which RXR\u03b1-RAR\u03b3 is associated with transcription activation, while Sox2 and Egr1 were predicted to regulate repression. Finally, RXR\u03b1-RAR\u03b3 regulatory networks were reconstructed through integration of functional co-citations. Our analysis provides a dynamic view of RA signalling during cell differentiation, reveals RAR heterodimer dynamics and promiscuity, and predicts decisions that diversify the RA signal into distinct gene-regulatory programs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422d","authors":["Marco A Mendoza-Parra","Mannu Walia","Martial Sankar","Hinrich Gronemeyer"],"doi":"10.1038\/msb.2011.73","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2011-10-12T18:31:47+00:00","issns":["false","1744-4292"],"journal":"Molecular Systems Biology","last_mentioned_on":1318444134,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/msb\/journal\/v7\/n1\/full\/msb201173.html"],"pmid":"21988834","pubdate":"2011-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["molecularbiology","computationalbiology"],"title":"Dissecting the retinoid-induced differentiation of F9 embryonal stem cells by integrative genomics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dissecting-retinoidinduced-differentiation-f9-embryonal-stem-cells-integrative-genomics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3109505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":999748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67603,"mean":4.3179159196473,"rank":41325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":18951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67603,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":530,"mean":7.6765822306238,"rank":475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":530,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":5.549,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
