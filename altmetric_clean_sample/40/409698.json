Female participants performed 30 min of downhill treadmill running (-12% grade, 8.0 mph), followed by consumption of a CHO, CHO+PRO, or PLA beverage immediately, 30, and 60 min after exercise. CHO and CHO+PRO groups (n=6 per group) consumed 1.2 g x kg body weight(-1) x hr(-1) CHO, with the CHO+PRO group consuming an additional 0.3 g x kg body weight(-1) x hr(-1) PRO. The PLA group (n=6) received an isovolumetric noncaloric beverage. Maximal isometric quadriceps strength (QUAD), lower extremity muscle soreness (SOR), and serum creatine kinase (CK) were assessed preinjury (PRE) and immediately and 1, 2, and 3 d postinjury to assess exercise-induced muscle injury and rate of recovery. There was no effect of treatment on recovery of QUAD (p= .21), SOR (p= .56), or CK (p= .59). In all groups, QUAD was reduced compared with PRE by 20.6%+\/-1.5%, 17.2%+\/-2.3%, and 11.3%+\/-2.3% immediately, 1, and 2 d postinjury, respectively (p< .05). SOR peaked at 2 d postinjury (PRE vs. 2 d, 3.1+\/-1.0 vs. 54.0+\/-4.8 mm, p< .01), and serum CK peaked 1 d postinjury (PRE vs. 1 d, 138+\/-47 vs. 757+\/-144 U\/L, p< .01). In conclusion, consuming a CHO+PRO or CHO beverage immediately after novel eccentric exercise failed to enhance recovery of exercise-induced muscle injury differently than what was observed with a PLA drink.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100059b7","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T01:15:15+00:00","issns":["1526-484X"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Sport Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1282313700,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18272930"],"pmid":"18272930","pubdate":"2008-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism","sportsmedicine","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Carbohydrate-protein drinks do not enhance recovery from exercise-induced muscle injury.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbohydrateprotein-drinks-not-enhance-recovery-exerciseinduced-muscle-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.664,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.664},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4011094,"mean":5.0321032720621,"rank":524879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3485353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4011094,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67846,"mean":3.8688200698672,"rank":7959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":59816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67846,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":472,"mean":9.7088832271762,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":472,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.1541666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
