Ten equids were evaluated in the fall (September to November). Seven equids had a history of persimmon ingestion. CLINICAL FINDINGS-A diagnosis of phytobezoar caused by persimmon ingestion was made for all equids. Eight equids had gastric persimmon phytobezoars; 5 had enteric persimmon phytobezoars. Gastroscopy or gastroduodenoscopy revealed evidence of persimmon ingestion in 8 of 10 equids in which these procedures were performed. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME-2 of 13 equids were euthanatized prior to treatment. Supportive care was instituted in 11 of 13 equids, including IV administration of fluids (n = 8) and treatment with antimicrobials (5), NSAIDs (5), and gastric acid suppressants (4). Persimmon phytobezoar-specific treatments included dietary modification to a pelleted feed (n = 8); oral or nasogastric administration of cola or diet cola (4), cellulase (2), or mineral oil (2); surgery (4); and intrapersimmon phytobezoar injections with acetylcysteine (1). Medical treatment in 5 of 7 equids resulted in resolution of gastric persimmon phytobezoars. Seven of 8 equids with gastric persimmon phytobezoars and 1 of 5 equids with enteric persimmon phytobezoars survived > 1 year after hospital discharge. CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Historical knowledge of persimmon ingestion in equids with gastrointestinal disease warrants gastroduodenoscopy for evaluation of the presence of persimmon phytobezoars. In equids with gastric persimmon phytobezoars, medical management (including administration of cola or diet cola and dietary modification to a pelleted feed) may allow for persimmon phytobezoar dissolution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5e","doi":"10.2460\/javma.239.8.1110","first_seen_on":"2011-10-16T03:15:38+00:00","issns":["1943-569X"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association","last_mentioned_on":1330830582,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21985354?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/avmajournals.avma.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2460\/javma.239.8.1110"],"pmid":"21985354","pubdate":"2011-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Am Vet Med Assoc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Gastric and enteric phytobezoars caused by ingestion of persimmon in equids.","type":"article","volume":"239","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gastric-enteric-phytobezoars-caused-ingestion-persimmon-equids"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2055780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2956409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70326,"mean":4.6856599217916,"rank":22220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":47902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70326,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1389,"mean":3.4534682997118,"rank":639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1389,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.2197142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
