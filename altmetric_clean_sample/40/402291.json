One of the most challenging scientific problems has been to understand the relationship between the pristine, individual nanotube mobility (known to be in the 10,000 cm(2)\/V\u00b7s range) and the as-deposited random network mobility (recently demonstrated in the 100 cm(2)\/V\u00b7s range). An additional significant scientific hurdle has been to understand, manage, and ultimately eliminate the effects of metallic nanotubes on the network performance, specifically the on\/off ratio. Additional scientific progress is important in understanding the dependence of nanotube length, diameter, and density on device performance. Finally, the development of ink formulations that are of practical use in manufacturing is of paramount importance, especially with regard to drying time and uniformity, and ultimately, the issue of scalability and cost must be addressed. Many of these issues have recently been investigated from a phenomenological point of view, and a comprehensive understanding is beginning to emerge. In this paper, we present an overview of solution-based printed carbon nanotube devices and discuss long-term technology prospects. While significant technical challenges still remain, it is clear that the prospects for the use of nanotube ink in a myriad of systems is feasible given their unmatched mobility and compatibility with heterogeneous integration into a variety of applications in printed and flexible electronics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Nima Rouhi","Dheeraj Jain","Peter John Burke"],"doi":"10.1021\/nn201828y","first_seen_on":"2011-10-14T00:11:37+00:00","issns":["1936-0851","1936-086X"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1318583574,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn201828y?ref=tw"],"pmid":"21970293","pubdate":"2011-10-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"111013150108004","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"High-Performance Semiconducting Nanotube Inks: Progress and Prospects","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highperformance-semiconducting-nanotube-inks-progress-prospects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619418,"mean":4.9283821178971,"rank":2015839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":926492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619418,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64659,"mean":4.0141564230257,"rank":26067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":27624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64659,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2911,"mean":8.8992219931271,"rank":1825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2911,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":6.7643269230769,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":37,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
