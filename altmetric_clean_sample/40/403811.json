Here we demonstrate that Cripto and its receptor GRP78 are important regulators of HSCs in the niche. Flow cytometry analyses revealed two distinct subpopulations of CD34(-)KSL cells based on the expression of GRP78, and these populations showed different reconstitution potential in transplantation assays. GRP78(+)HSCs mainly reside in the endosteal area, are more hypoxic, and exhibit a lower mitochondrial potential, and their HSC capacity was maintained in\u00a0vitro by Cripto through induction of higher glycolytic activity. Additionally, HIF-1\u03b1 KO mice have decreased numbers of GRP78(+)HSCs and reduced expression of Cripto in the endosteal niche. Furthermore, blocking GRP78 induced a movement of HSCs from the endosteal to the central marrow area. These data suggest that Cripto\/GRP78 signaling is an important pathway that regulates HSC quiescence and maintains HSCs in hypoxia as an intermediary of HIF-1\u03b1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e1f","authors":["Stefan Karlsson"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.stem.2011.07.016","first_seen_on":"2011-10-15T12:06:48+00:00","issns":["1934-5909"],"journal":"Cell Stem Cell","last_mentioned_on":1319430474,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell-stem-cell\/abstract\/S1934-5909(11)00379-1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21982233"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/download.cell.com\/cell-stem-cell\/pdf\/PIIS1934590911003791.pdf","pmid":"21982233","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Cripto Regulates Hematopoietic Stem Cells as a Hypoxic-Niche-Related Factor through Cell Surface Receptor GRP78","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cripto-regulates-hematopoietic-stem-cells-hypoxicnicherelated-factor-through-cell-surface-receptor-g"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":1929136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3067658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69694,"mean":4.753293960656,"rank":20228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":48677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69694,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1140,"mean":20.537030728709,"rank":831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1140,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":4.5064,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
