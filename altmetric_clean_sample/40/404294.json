We are extending coverage to heart transplants based on the results of the National Heart Transplant Study and our subsequent determination that heart transplants are a medically reasonable and necessary service when specific criteria are met. Because the HCFA Ruling HCFAR 80-1 excluded heart transplants from coverage under that Medicare program, we are issuing this notice as a new HCFA ruling. It will rescind HCFAR 80-1 and set forth the new coverage policy for heart transplants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5b43cf058f610005414","first_seen_on":"2011-10-15T14:10:43+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0097-6326"],"issue":"65","journal":"Federal Register","last_mentioned_on":1318002856,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/10301842\/"],"pmid":"10301842","pubdate":"1987-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"Medicare program; criteria for Medicare coverage of heart transplants--HCFA.
