Plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF-Endoret) technology offers a potential source of growth factors involved in tissue regeneration. Here, we evaluate the potential of PRGF-Endoret over tendon cells and synovial fibroblasts migration and study whether the combination of this autologous technology with hyaluronic acid (HA) improves the effect and potential of the biomaterials over the motility of both types of fibroblasts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fc1","doi":"10.1007\/s00167-011-1697-4","first_seen_on":"2011-10-12T11:13:37+00:00","issns":["1433-7347"],"journal":"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy","last_mentioned_on":1318414043,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21987365?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21987365","pubdate":"2011-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","sportsmedicine"],"title":"Plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF-Endoret) stimulates tendon and synovial fibroblasts migration and improves the biological properties of hyaluronic acid.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasma-rich-growth-factors-prgfendoret-stimulates-tendon-synovial-fibroblasts-migration-improves-bio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":3556294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":831524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69564,"mean":4.7834249241694,"rank":46095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":11020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69564,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":908,"mean":3.6610826901874,"rank":618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":908,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.1483333333333,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
