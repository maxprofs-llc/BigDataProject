The study used data on participants who were 71-81 years of age in the baseline survey in 1997 (n = 492) and in the 11th wave, in 2008 (n = 620). The number of medications currently consumed (mean = 4.6 and 3.4, respectively) and prevalence of polypharmacy (46.6% and 29.1%, respectively) were higher in the more recent cohort as compared to the earlier one. These differences were independent of gender, age, schooling, number of medical visits in the previous 12 months, and number of chronic conditions. The more recent cohort showed significant differences in the use of psychoactive drugs, lipid modifying agents, drugs for diabetes, and antithrombotic agents, as well as changes in drugs used for arterial hypertension. In general, these changes are consistent with those observed in elderly populations in high-income countries.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd06","first_seen_on":"2011-10-17T10:46:28+00:00","issns":["1678-4464"],"journal":"Cadernos de sa\u00fade p\u00fablica","last_mentioned_on":1318900318,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21952865?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21952865","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Birth cohort differences in the use of medications in a Brazilian population of older elderly: the Bambu\u00ed cohort study of aging (1997 and 2008).","type":"article","volume":"27 Suppl 3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/birth-cohort-differences-medications-brazilian-population-older-elderly-bambu%C3%AD-cohort-study-aging-19"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4655094,"mean":5.6505438971925,"rank":1927521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2648469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4655094,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69388,"mean":4.4428682606252,"rank":20917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":46790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69388,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":407,"mean":1.7389901477833,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":407,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
