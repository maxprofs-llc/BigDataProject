Children are also infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with different antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Thus, each child will achieve different AUC0-24\/MIC ratios when treated with the same dose.\n\u2003We used 10 000-subject Monte Carlo experiments to identify the oral doses of linezolid, moxifloxacin, and faropenem that would achieve optimal target exposures associated with optimal efficacy in children with disseminated tuberculosis. The linezolid and moxifloxacin exposure targets were AUC0-24\/MIC ratios of 62 and 122, and a faropenem percentage of time above MIC >60%, in combination therapy. A linezolid AUC0-24 of 93.4 mg \u00d7 hour\/L was target for toxicity. Population pharmacokinetic parameters of each drug and between-child variability, as well as MIC distribution, were used, and the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was calculated. We also considered drug penetration indices into meninges, bone, and peritoneum.\n\u2003The linezolid dose of 15 mg\/kg in full-term neonates and infants aged up to 3 months and 10 mg\/kg in toddlers, administered once daily, achieved CFR \u2265 90%, with <10% achieving linezolid AUC0-24 associated with toxicity. The moxifloxacin dose of 25 mg\/kg\/day achieved a CFR > 90% in infants, but the optimal dose was 20 mg\/kg\/day in older children. The faropenem medoxomil optimal dosage was 30 mg\/kg 3-4 times daily.\n\u2003The regimen and doses of linezolid, moxifloxacin, and faropenem identified are proposed to be adequate for all disseminated tuberculosis syndromes, whether drug-resistant or -susceptible.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Shashikant Srivastava","Devyani Deshpande","Jotam Pasipanodya","Eric Nuermberger","Soumya Swaminathan","Tawanda Gumbo"],"doi":"10.1093\/cid\/ciw483","endpage":"S109","first_seen_on":"2016-11-30T14:44:56+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1537-6591"],"issue":"suppl 3","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1480516200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/cid\/ciw483"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/63\/suppl_3\/S102.full.pdf","pmid":"27742641","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S102","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Optimal Clinical Doses of Faropenem, Linezolid, and Moxifloxacin in Children With Disseminated Tuberculosis: Goldilocks","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimal-clinical-doses-faropenem-linezolid-moxifloxacin-children-disseminated-tuberculosis-goldilock"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":8,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7826281,"mean":6.6353071855279,"rank":976405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6828501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7826281,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250579,"mean":12.181271715793,"rank":46720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":203379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250579,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7639,"mean":8.7369900497513,"rank":1484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7639,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":10.107807692308,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
