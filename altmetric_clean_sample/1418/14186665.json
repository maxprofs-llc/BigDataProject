High-resolution in situ measurements of total dissolved Mn were obtained in near real-time by spectrophotometry using 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol (PAN). PAN is a complexing agent of dissolved Mn and forms a wine-red complex with a maximum absorbance at a wavelength of 562 nm. Results are presented together with ancillary temperature, salinity, and dissolved O 2 data. Lab calibration of the analyzer was performed in a pressure testing tank. A detection limit of 77 nM was obtained. For validation purposes, discrete water samples were taken by using a pump-CTD system. Dissolved Mn in these samples was determined by an independent laboratory based method (inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, ICP-OES). Mn measurements from both METIS and ICP-OES analysis were in good agreement. The results showed that the in situ analysis of dissolved Mn is a powerful technique reducing dependencies on heavy and expensive equipment (pump-CTD system, ICP-OES) and is also cost and time effective.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["David Meyer"],"doi":"10.3390\/s16122027","first_seen_on":"2016-11-30T13:15:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"12","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1480639690,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/12\/2027?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/12\/2027"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/12\/2027\/pdf","pmid":"27916898","pubdate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2027","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"A Multi-Pumping Flow System for In Situ Measurements of Dissolved Manganese in Aquatic Systems","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multipumping-flow-system-situ-measurements-dissolved-manganese-aquatic-systems"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":3878223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3759843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251243,"mean":12.178931341097,"rank":127628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":114848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251243,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3239,"mean":1.8349054972205,"rank":819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":2298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3239,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":536,"mean":1.5810280373832,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":536,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
