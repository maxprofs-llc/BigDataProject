The identification of these syndromes provides information about the underlying tumor, systemic symptoms, and debilitating complications. The recognition of these syndromes is particularly helpful in cases of skin lesions presenting as the first sign of the malignancy, and the underlying malignancy can be treated in a timely manner. Autoimmune paraneoplastic and neoplasm-associated bullous skin syndromes are characterized by blister formation due to an autoimmune response to components of the epidermis or basement membrane in the context of a neoplasm. The clinical manifestations, histopathology and immunopathology findings, target antigens, associated neoplasm, current diagnostic criteria, current understanding of pathogenesis, and treatment options for a selection of four diseases are reviewed. Paraneoplastic pemphigus manifests with clinically distinct painful mucosal erosions and polymorphic cutaneous lesions, and is often associated with lymphoproliferative neoplasm. In contrast, bullous pemphigoid associated with neoplasm presents with large tense subepidermal bullae of the skin, and mild mucosal involvement, but without unique clinical features. Mucous membrane pemphigoid associated with neoplasm is a disorder of chronic subepithelial blisters that evolve into erosions and ulcerations that heal with scarring, and involves stratified squamous mucosal surfaces. Linear IgA dermatosis associated with neoplasm is characterized by annularly grouped pruritic papules, vesicles, and bullae along the extensor surfaces of elbows, knees, and buttocks. Physicians should be aware that these autoimmune paraneoplastic and neoplasm-associated syndromes can manifest distinct or similar clinical features as compared with the non-neoplastic counterparts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f3","authors":["Saritha Kartan","Vivian Y.
