While he initially denied recent IV drug abuse, his physical examination was highly suggestive of a fungal infection known to result from brown heroin use. He was ultimately diagnosed with meningitis, ventriculitis, and endogenous endophthalmitis believed to result from a Candida species. The response to treatment with vitrectomy and broad-spectrum antimicrobials gave support to the presumed diagnosis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: We provide a rarely described report of a possible complication from the use of IV brown heroin that led to a central nervous system infection involving vision loss by fungal infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d74","authors":["Melnychuk, Eric M","Sole, David P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jemermed.2016.09.011","first_seen_on":"2016-11-30T11:46:22+00:00","issns":["0736-4679","07364679"],"journal":"Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1480506366,"links":["http:\/\/www.jem-journal.com\/article\/S0736-4679(16)30722-3\/fulltext?rss=yes"],"pmid":"27727033","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"A Rare Central Nervous System Fungal Infection Resulting from Brown Heroin Use","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rare-central-nervous-system-fungal-infection-resulting-brown-heroin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7826281,"mean":6.6353071855279,"rank":6778869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7826281,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250580,"mean":12.181316886091,"rank":203362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250580,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1764,"mean":6.4012580828134,"rank":1541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1764,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":3.4003614457831,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/QuickMedClaims1\/statuses\/803928085980704769","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14185265],"posted_on":"2016-11-30T11:46:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Quick Med Claims","url":"http:\/\/www.quickmedclaims.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/812313237412806656\/2R1aUXNV_normal.jpg","description":"A National Leader in Emergency Medical Transportation Billing\/Reimbursement for EMS and the Air Medical Industry.
