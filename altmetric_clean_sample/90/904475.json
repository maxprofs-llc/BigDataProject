Seven patients were interviewed. An open explorative approach was applied and grounded theory was used for the analysis resulting in five categories illustrating how patients with schizophrenia handle their struggle for a normal life. The patients stressed first the importance of receiving information about the disease: for themselves, for society, and for their families. Taking part in social contacts such as attending meeting places and receiving home visits were identified as important as well as having meaningful employment. They also pointed out the importance of taking part in secure professional relationships. Mainly they expressed the need for continuity in the relationships and the wish to be heard and seen by the professionals. Finally, interviewees addressed the need for support for sustaining independent living through practical housekeeping and financial help. To conclude, the participants in the present study described their need for help as mainly linked to activities in their overall life situation rather than just their psychosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003ea4","authors":["Gunnmo P","Bergman HF","Petra Gunnmo","Helena Fatouros Bergman"],"doi":"10.3402\/qhw.v6i1.5412","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T17:34:08+00:00","issns":["1748-2631","1748-2623"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health & Well-Being","last_mentioned_on":1297758729,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijqhw.net\/index.php\/qhw\/article\/view\/5412"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijqhw.net\/index.php\/qhw\/article\/view\/5412\/7076","pmid":"21562628","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"CoAction Publishing","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"title":"What do individuals with schizophrenia need to increase their well-being","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/urn.kb.se\/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:su:diva-68646","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/individuals-schizophrenia-need-increase-wellbeing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635050,"mean":4.9227315329755,"rank":2900922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635050,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74878,"mean":5.0336246911601,"rank":55176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74878,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":1.7718446601942,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
