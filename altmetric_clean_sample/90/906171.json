Method: In a single blind randomized study 14 patients with unipolar resistant depression to one antidepressant treatment were enrolled to receive, in combination with venlafaxine (150\u2009mg), either 20 sessions of 10\u2009Hz rTMS (2000 pulses per session) applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or 20 sessions of 1\u2009Hz rTMS (120 stimulations per sessions) applied over the right DLPFC. Results: A similar antidepressant effect was observed in both groups with a comparable antidepressant delay of action (2\u2009weeks) and a comparable number of responders (MADRS\u2009<\u200915) after 4\u2009weeks of daily rTMS sessions (66 vs 50%). Conclusion: Low- and high- frequency rTMS seems to be effective as an add-on treatment to venlafaxine as monotherapy in pharmacological refractory major depression (stage 1). Due to its short duration (one session of 1\u2009Hz rTMS lasts 4\u2009min vs 16 for 10\u2009Hz rTMS) and its safety, low frequency rTMS may be a useful alternative treatment for patients with refractory depression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1a","authors":["Julien Eche","Marine Mondino","Frederic Haesebaert","Mohamed Saoud","Emmanuel Poulet","Jerome Brunelin"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpsyt.2012.00013","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T21:39:29+00:00","issns":["1664-0640"],"journal":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1363788799,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Neuropsychiatric_Imaging_and_Stimulation\/10.3389\/fpsyt.2012.00013\/abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3296064","pmid":"22408627","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Low- vs High-Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation as an Add-On Treatment for Refractory Depression","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lowvs-highfrequency-repetitive-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-addon-treatment-refractory-depressi-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628172,"mean":4.9437236464363,"rank":1531537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1997494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628172,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74838,"mean":5.0611452623702,"rank":23795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":49585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74838,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":458,"mean":7.0543194748359,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":458,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":2,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Hersteltalent\/status\/192700929395531776","citation_ids":[906171],"posted_on":"2012-04-18T19:47:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Hersteltalent","url":"http:\/\/www.hersteltalent.nl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/614167602831720449\/O6SeUVa-_normal.jpg","description":"Tweet over herstel in de GGZ en ver daar buiten.
