Iodide (I(-)) is an essential component of the thyroid hormones and is accumulated avidly by the thyroid gland. The rarity of elemental iodine and I(-) in the environment challenges the thyroid to orchestrate a remarkable series of transport processes that ultimately ensure sufficient levels for hormone synthesis. In addition to actively extracting circulating I(-), thyroid follicular epithelial cells must also translocate I(-) into a central intrafollicular compartment, where thyroglobulin is iodinated to form the protein precursor to T(4) and T(3). In the last decade, several bodies of evidence render questionable the notion that I(-) exits thyrocytes solely via the Cl(-)\/I(-) exchanger Pendrin (SLC26A4), therefore necessitating reconsideration of several other candidate I(-) conduits: the Cl(-)\/H(+) antiporter, CLC-5, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the sodium monocarboxylic acid transporter (SMCT1).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df5","authors":["Peying Fong"],"doi":"10.1113\/jphysiol.2011.218594","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T10:17:20+00:00","issns":["1469-7793"],"journal":"Journal of Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1323939239,"links":["http:\/\/jp.physoc.org\/content\/589\/24\/5929.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jp.physoc.org\/content\/589\/24\/5929.full.pdf","pmid":"21986207","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Thyroid iodide efflux: a team effort?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thyroid-iodide-efflux-team-effort"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627074,"mean":4.9506160212417,"rank":2906886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627074,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74829,"mean":5.0718144277543,"rank":55463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74829,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2246,"mean":5.1468881959911,"rank":1736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2246,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":4.8294117647059,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
