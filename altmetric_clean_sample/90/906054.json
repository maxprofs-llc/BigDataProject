Methods We studied 599 workers (451 men, mean age 45.4 years) who were employed in four nickel-cadmium battery plants for 18.8 years on average. After adjustment for covariates by multiple regression, the CdU threshold values for increased concentrations of retinol-binding protein (RBPU) and b(2)-microglobulin (b(2)-mU) were assessed by logistic regression and benchmark dose analyses using as referents workers with CdU<1 \u03bcg\/g creatinine. Results Relationships between urinary proteins and CdU (\u03bcg\/g creatinine) were influenced by sex, age, diuresis and especially smoking. When considering all workers, odds for abnormal RBPU and b(2)-mU were significantly increased from CdU of 6-10 and >10, respectively. The benchmark dose (BMD5) and the benchmark dose lower limit (BMDL5) for a 5% excess in the background prevalence of abnormal RBPU and b(2)-mU were estimated at 5.1\/3.0 and 9.6\/5.9. When excluding ever smokers, odds for abnormal RBPU and b(2)-mU were both increased only among workers with CdU>10 (OR, 21.8, 95% CI, 6.4-74.4 and OR, 15.1, 95% CI, 3.6-63.1, respectively). In never smokers, these BMD5\/BMDL5 of CdU were estimated at 12.6\/6.6 and 12.2\/5.5 while in ever smokers they were 6.2\/4.9 and 4.3\/3.5. Conclusions On the basis of associations undistorted by smoking and adjusted for covariates, the BMDL5 of CdU for low-molecular-weight proteinuria induced by occupational exposure to Cd can be reliably estimated between 5.5 and 6.6 \u03bcg\/g creatinine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"52b2ceaa3cf058a06b8b4568","authors":["Agn\u00e8s Chaumont","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric De Winter","Xavier Dumont","Vincent Haufroid","Alfred Bernard"],"doi":"10.1136\/oem.2009.054122","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T21:31:45+00:00","issns":["1470-7926"],"issue":"4","journal":"Occupational and environmental medicine","last_mentioned_on":1299669422,"links":["http:\/\/oem.bmj.com\/content\/68\/4\/257.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/oem.bmj.com\/content\/68\/4\/257.full.pdf","pmid":"20935291","pubdate":"2011-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Unlocked","scheme":"bmj"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"257","subjects":["environmentalhealth","occupationalmedicine"],"title":"The threshold level of urinary cadmium associated with increased urinary excretion of retinol-binding protein and \u03b22-microglobulin: a re-assessment in a large cohort of nickel-cadmium battery workers","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threshold-level-urinary-cadmium-associated-increased-urinary-excretion-retinolbinding-protein-2micro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":2902494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74843,"mean":5.0547568477593,"rank":55353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74843,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":770,"mean":6.7668868660598,"rank":641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":770,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":5.2346923076923,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
