Our previous study found that the HBx-d382 deletion mutant (deleted at nt 382-400) can down-regulate miR-338-3p expression in HBx-expressing cells. The aim of the present study is to examine the role of miR-338-3p in the HBx-d382-mediated liver-cell proliferation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0043204","first_seen_on":"2012-08-24T02:47:11+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1345776264,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22912826?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22912826","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Effect of miR-338-3p on HBx Deletion-Mutant (HBx-d382) Mediated Liver-Cell Proliferation through CyclinD1 Regulation.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-mir3383p-hbx-deletionmutant-hbxd382-mediated-livercell-proliferation-through-cyclind1-regulat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3094899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":972749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78325,"mean":5.3658578724273,"rank":50696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78325,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80036,"mean":8.2856098956707,"rank":55702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":16856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80036,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3571,"mean":6.9331613445378,"rank":2539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3571,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
