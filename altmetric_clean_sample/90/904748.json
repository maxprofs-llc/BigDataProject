Such anomalies include total or partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, sinus venosus defect, malposition of the septum primum, cor triatriatum, pulmonary vein atresia or stenosis, and abnormal number or course of the pulmonary veins. MR imaging provides a wealth of anatomic and functional data that are valuable in case management and planning intervention. Gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography is the mainstay of anatomic evaluation. Ventricular volumetry with two-dimensional steady-state free-precession sequences and flow analysis with cine phase-contrast imaging provide physiologic information that may be used to calculate the degree of right heart enlargement and the shunt fraction, allowing the cardiologist to determine the functional importance of the lesion. CT provides superior spatial resolution and short imaging times but at the expense of exposure to ionizing radiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086d9","authors":["Himesh V.
