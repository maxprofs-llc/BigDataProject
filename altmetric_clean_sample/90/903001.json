We report the case of a 56-year-old woman who complained of intermittent fever in the afternoon and productive cough and pain on the right side of the chest. Her clinical condition deteriorated despite antibiotherapy. FDG PET\/CT showed a heterogeneous soft tissue mass at the lower part of the right lung with obvious FDG uptake in the peripheral part of the mass. Mucormycosis was proven by histopathology and fungal culture from the transbronchial lung biopsy materials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0b013e31825ae470","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T13:46:38+00:00","issns":["0363-9762"],"issue":"8","journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1344506645,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Abstract\/2012\/08000\/The_Appearance_of_Pulmonary_Mucormycosis_on_FDG.22.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/2012\/08000\/The_Appearance_of_Pulmonary_Mucormycosis_on_FDG.22.pdf","pmid":"22785517","pubdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"801","subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"The Appearance of Pulmonary Mucormycosis on FDG PET\/CT","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/appearance-pulmonary-mucormycosis-fdg-petct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632209,"mean":4.9245852853192,"rank":2898300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632209,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74868,"mean":5.0417198765811,"rank":55201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74868,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1537,"mean":0.9598125,"rank":1049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1537,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128,"mean":1.146062992126,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"The Appearance of Pulmonary Mucormycosis on FDG PET\/CT : Clinical Nuclear Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=373256709410062&id=283600854993937","citation_ids":[903001],"posted_on":"2012-08-09T10:04:05+00:00","summary":"New Article:","author":{"name":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/283600854993937","facebook_wall_name":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/283600854993937\/picture","id_on_source":"283600854993937"}}]}}
