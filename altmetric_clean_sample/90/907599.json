The information may be encoded in conformational changes, the interaction kinetics and, in the case of multichain immunoreceptors, by chain rearrangements. The signals may be modulated by dynamic compartmentalization of the cell membrane, cellular architecture, motility, and activation-all of which are difficult to reconstitute for studies of receptor signaling in vitro. In this paper, we will discuss how protein interactions in general and receptor signaling in particular can be studied in living cells by different fluorescence imaging techniques. Particularly versatile are methods that exploit F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), which is exquisitely sensitive to the nanometer-range proximity and orientation between fluorophores. Fluorescence correlation microscopy (FCM) can provide complementary information about the stoichiometry and diffusion kinetics of large complexes, while bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and other complementation techniques can capture transient interactions. A continuing challenge is extracting from the imaging data the quantitative information that is necessary to verify different models of signal transduction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088e4","authors":["Tomasz Zal","Zal T"],"doi":"10.4161\/self.2.2.17932","endpage":"107","first_seen_on":"2012-08-23T00:34:46+00:00","funders":["niaid","nci"],"issns":["1938-2030","1938-2049"],"issue":"2","journal":"Self\/Nonself","last_mentioned_on":1322850363,"links":["http:\/\/www.landesbioscience.com\/journals\/selfnonself\/article\/17932\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.landesbioscience.com\/journals\/selfnonself\/04-Zal-SNS2-2.pdf","pmid":"22299061","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","startpage":"98","title":"Visualization of protein interactions in living cells","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visualization-protein-interactions-living-cells-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":2906949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74921,"mean":5.0638619594234,"rank":55522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74921,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.4045454545455,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
