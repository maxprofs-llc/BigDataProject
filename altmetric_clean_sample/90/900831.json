The contribution of the wash step to cell loss and ultimately the dose of cells available for transplant is not well described. To investigate the amount of cell loss after washing and its impact on major outcomes compared to pre-cryopreserved TNC, we analyzed data from patients prospectively enrolled on a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute sponsored cord blood transplant study between 1999 and 2003. There were 310 patients \u226418 yr of age with malignant (N = 218) or non-malignant (N = 92) disease enrolled on this trial. Only single CBU were used. All CBU were thawed and washed using an identical process. The median TNC after thawing and washing (PTW) was 5.43 \u00d7 10(7) \/kg (79% recovery of cells). The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was significantly higher in patients receiving a PTW TNC \u22652.5 \u00d7 10(7) \/kg (p = 0.01). The cumulative incidence of TRM was higher among patients receiving post-thaw-and-wash TNC <2.5 \u00d7 10(7) \/kg (p = 0.039). In conclusion, receiving a PTW TNC of <2.5 \u00d7 10(7) \/kg resulted in worse neutrophil engraftment and increased transplant-related mortality compared to a PTW TNC of \u22652.5 \u00d7 10(7) \/kg.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b6","authors":["McManus, Meghann Pine","Wang, Li","Calder, Cassie","Manes, Becky","Evans, Misty","Bruce, Kathryn","Ho, Richard H.","Domm, Jennifer","Frangoul, Haydar"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1399-3046.2012.01698.x","endpage":"442","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T10:11:57+00:00","issns":["1399-3046","1397-3142"],"issue":"5","journal":"Pediatric Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1338048730,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1399-3046.2012.01698.x\/abstract?elq=5a2a93c051e34dfe979654dc6458a514&goback=.gmp_1778363.gde_1778363_member_113025936","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1399-3046.2012.01698.x\/abstract?elq=5a2a93c051e34dfe979654dc6458a514&goback=.gde_1778363_member_113025936"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1399-3046.2012.01698.x\/pdf","pmid":"22533817","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"438","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Comparison of pre\u00e2\u0080\u0090cryopreserved and post\u00e2\u0080\u0090thaw\u00e2\u0080\u0090and\u00e2\u0080\u0090wash\u00e2\u0080\u0090nucleated cell count on major outcomes following unrelated cord blood transplant in children","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-precryopreserved-postthawandwashnucleated-cell-count-major-outcomes-following-unrelated-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635048,"mean":4.9225817734301,"rank":2742731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":734228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635048,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74878,"mean":5.0331355689998,"rank":49775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":19708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74878,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236,"mean":1.2617191489362,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.3125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Pediatric Transplantation","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=297734303644682&id=105989748752","citation_ids":[900831],"posted_on":"2012-05-08T03:49:43+00:00","summary":"To investigate the amount of cell loss after washing and its impact on major outcomes compared to pre-cryopreserved total nucleated cell count, researchers analyzed data from patients prospectively enrolled in a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute spo","author":{"name":"Cord Blood Forum","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/105989748752","facebook_wall_name":"Cord Blood Forum","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/105989748752\/picture","id_on_source":"105989748752"}},{"title":"Comparison of pre-cryopreserved and post-thaw-and-wash-nucleated cell count on major outcomes follow","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=403736753004155&id=118096611578673","citation_ids":[900831],"posted_on":"2012-05-26T16:12:10+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1399-3046.2012.01698.x\/abstract?elq=5a2a93c051e34dfe979654dc6458a514&goback=%2Egde_1778363_member_113025936","author":{"name":"Prabhu Mishra","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/118096611578673","facebook_wall_name":"BabyCell","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/118096611578673\/picture","id_on_source":"118096611578673"}}]}}
