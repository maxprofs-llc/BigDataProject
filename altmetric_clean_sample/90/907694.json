Recently, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau protein levels have been reported to be associated with shorter survival in clinically diagnosed DLB. Correlations between CSF biomarkers and neuropathological findings in DLB are missing. The aim of this study was to investigate correlations between CSF biomarker levels and histopathological findings, with a focus on concomitant Alzheimer pathology, in neuropathologically verified DLB cases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b54","authors":["Brunnstr\u00f6m, Hans","Hansson, Oskar","Zetterberg, Henrik","Londos, Elisabet","Englund, Elisabet"],"doi":"10.1002\/gps.3881","endpage":"744","first_seen_on":"2012-08-23T00:53:10+00:00","issns":["1099-1166","0885-6230"],"issue":"7","journal":"International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1345682624,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fgps.3881"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/gps.3881\/pdf","pmid":"22911491","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"738","subjects":["geriatrics","psychiatry"],"title":"Correlations of CSF tau and amyloid levels with Alzheimer pathology in neuropathologically verified dementia with Lewy bodies","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlations-csf-tau-amyloid-levels-alzheimer-pathology-neuropathologically-verified-dementia-lewy-b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6389042,"mean":5.9818244910308,"rank":5441264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6389042,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85792,"mean":5.7923156974508,"rank":70134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85792,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":792,"mean":3.8724323640961,"rank":673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":792,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.3375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
