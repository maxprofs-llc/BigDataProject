This absence causes loss of repression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)-mediated pathways resulting in the behavioral and cognitive impairments associated with FXS. In a randomized, double-blind trial it was recently demonstrated a beneficial effect of AFQ056, a selective inhibitor of metabotrobic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5), on fully methylated FXS patients respect to partially methylated FXS ones.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c1","authors":["Elisabetta Tabolacci","Elisabetta Tabolacci","Filomena Pirozzi","Baltazar Gomez-Mancilla","Fabrizio Gasparini","Giovanni Neri"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2350-13-13","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T14:14:09+00:00","issns":["","1471-2350"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1345644410,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2350\/13\/13"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcmedgenet\/content\/pdf\/1471-2350-13-13.pdf","pmid":"22397687","pubdate":"2012-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics and Population Dynamics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"13","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"The mGluR5 antagonist AFQ056 does not affect methylation and transcription of the mutant FMR1 gene in vitro","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mglur5-antagonist-afq056-not-affect-methylation-transcription-mutant-fmr1-gene-vitro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622323,"mean":4.9312868762118,"rank":2016444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":928504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622323,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74800,"mean":5.0794991911656,"rank":35613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74800,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321,"mean":2.48160625,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.2038181818182,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
