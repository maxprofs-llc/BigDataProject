Cytoarchitectonically distinct cortical areas have different densities and types of neurons. Thus, signaling patterns may also vary among cytoarchitectonically unique cortical areas. To examine how neuronal signaling patterns are related to innate cortical functions, we detected intrinsic features of cortical firing by devising a metric that efficiently isolates non-Poisson irregular characteristics, independent of spike rate fluctuations that are caused extrinsically by ever-changing behavioral conditions. Using the new metric, we analyzed spike trains from over 1,000 neurons in 15 cortical areas sampled by eight independent neurophysiological laboratories. Analysis of firing-pattern dissimilarities across cortical areas revealed a gradient of firing regularity that corresponded closely to the functional category of the cortical area; neuronal spiking patterns are regular in motor areas, random in the visual areas, and bursty in the prefrontal area. Thus, signaling patterns may play an important role in function-specific cerebral cortical computation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003349","authors":["Shigeru Shinomoto","Hideaki Kim","Takeaki Shimokawa","Nanae Matsuno","Shintaro Funahashi","Keisetsu Shima","Ichiro Fujita","Hiroshi Tamura","Taijiro Doi","Kenji Kawano","Naoko Inaba","Kikuro Fukushima","Sergei Kurkin","Kiyoshi Kurata","Masato Taira","Ken-Ichiro Tsutsui","Hidehiko Komatsu","Tadashi Ogawa","Kowa Koida","Jun Tanji","Keisuke Toyama"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1000433","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T18:17:38+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1553-7358"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology","last_mentioned_on":1355097600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ploscompbiol.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1000433"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1000433.pdf","pmid":"19593378","pubdate":"2009-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Mathematics","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"e1000433","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Relating Neuronal Firing Patterns to Functional Differentiation of Cerebral Cortex","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relating-neuronal-firing-patterns-functional-differentiation-cerebral-cortex-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":745085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":2872569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74839,"mean":5.0603134236618,"rank":14805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":59786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74839,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2436,"mean":10.357274743326,"rank":1028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2436,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":10.402292682927,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":37,"Student  > Ph.
