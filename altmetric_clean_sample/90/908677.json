On coordination they adopt diverse binding modes, depending on the nature of the metal and the reaction conditions. In the Ag, K and Cr complexes reported in this paper, monodentate \u03ba(1)(NHC), bimetallic bridging-(\u03ba(1)-NHC-\u03ba(1)-amidinato) and bidentate (\u03ba(1)-NHC-\u03ba(1)-amidinato) binding modes were observed, respectively. Two of the novel Cr complexes, in the presence of activators, were tested as catalysts for the polymerisation of ethylene showing low activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Andreas Danopoulos","Pierre Braunstein","Robert P Tooze","Martin Hanton","Susana Conde Guadano","Susana Conde-Guadano","Robert P.
