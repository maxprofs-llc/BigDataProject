Such functionalized polar wires exhibit molecular reorientation in response to an electric field. Ferroelectric polarizations as large as 23.0 \u03bcC\/cm(2) are predicted in crystals based on fully hydroxylized sandwich nanowires. Furthermore, we find that organic nanowires formed by sandwiching transition-metal atoms in croconic and rhodizonic acids, dihydroxybenzoquinone, dichloro-dihydroxy-p-benzoquinone, or benzene decorated by -COOH groups exhibit ordered magnetic moments, leading to a multiferroic organometallic crystal. When crystallized through hydrogen bonds, the microscopic molecular reorientation translates into a switchable polarization through proton transfer. A giant interface magnetoelectric response that is orders of magnitude greater than previously reported for conventional oxide heterostructure interfaces is predicted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Menghao Wu"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja304199x","first_seen_on":"2012-08-23T18:37:58+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1346255405,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja304199x"],"pmid":"22881120","pubdate":"2012-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Multiferroic Materials Based on Organic Transition-Metal Molecular Nanowires","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiferroic-materials-based-organic-transitionmetal-molecular-nanowires"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2122383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2224525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78218,"mean":5.390991037754,"rank":32949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":42105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78218,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1151220520773,"rank":8909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":6070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":481,"mean":4.1750916666667,"rank":206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":481,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
