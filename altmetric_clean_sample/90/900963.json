They were divided into group A, open anastomosis (circulatory arrest; n = 59) and group B, closed anastomosis (no circulatory arrest; n = 41). Aortic valve re-suspension or replacement was performed in 77 patients, aortic root replacement in 29, and aortic arch procedures in 31. The median follow-up was 2.8 years (range, 0-8.6 years). The 30-day mortality was 14%; 16.9% in group A and 9.8% in group B. None of the 23 variables analyzed to determine predictors of death or stroke was significant on multivariate analysis. Postoperatively, there was no difference between the 2 groups with respect to stroke, sepsis, renal failure, multiorgan failure, or reoperation. Overall actuarial survival at 1, 3, 5, and 8 years was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Considerable morbidity is still associated with repair of type A aortic dissection, despite a significant improvement in mortality.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8303cf058f61000be3d","authors":["Vohra HA","Modi A","Barlow CW","Ohri SK","Livesey SA","Tsang GM"],"doi":"10.1177\/0218492311434592","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T10:17:24+00:00","issns":["0218-4923"],"issue":"2","journal":"Asian Cardiovascular & Thoracic Annals","last_mentioned_on":1345630447,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22499963?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22499963","pubdate":"2012-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Repair of acute type A aortic dissection: results in 100 patients.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/repair-acute-type-aortic-dissection-results-100-patients-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9190323311044,"rank":2899417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74878,"mean":5.0374854761809,"rank":55142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74878,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":0.90301428571429,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
