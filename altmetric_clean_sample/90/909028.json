Were this so, who would volunteer to be scanned? We report a \"natural experiment\" casting some light upon this question. Following broadcast of a television series describing our team's investigative neuroimaging of deception in 2007, we received unsolicited (public) correspondence for 12 months. Using a customized template to examine this material, three independent assessors unanimously rated 30 of an initial 56 communications as unequivocally constituting requests for a \"scan\" (to demonstrate their author's \"innocence\"). Compared with the rest, these index communications were more likely to originate from incarcerated males, who were also more likely to engage in further correspondence. Hence, in conclusion, if neuroimaging were to become an acceptable means of demonstrating innocence then incarcerated males may well constitute those volunteering for such investigation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db2","authors":["Spence SA","Hope-Urwin A","Lankappa ST","Woodhead J","Burgess JC","Mackay AV","Spence, Sean A.","Hope\u2010Urwin, Alexandra","Lankappa, Sudheer T.","Woodhead, Jean","Burgess, Jenny C.L.","Mackay, Alice V.","Sean A.
