We hypothesized that delayed injection of bone-marrow stem cells (BMSCs) 24\u00a0h after the onset of ischemia could effectively rescue ischemic retina from its consequences, including apoptosis, inflammation, and increased vascular permeability, thereby preventing retinal cell loss.\nRetinal ischemia was induced in adult Wistar rats by increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) to 130-135\u00a0mmHg for 55\u00a0min. BMSCs harvested from rat femur were injected into the vitreous 24\u00a0h post-ischemia. Functional recovery was assessed 7\u00a0days later using electroretinography (ERG) measurements of the a-wave, b-wave, P2, scotopic threshold response (STR), and oscillatory potentials (OP). The retinal injury and anti-ischemic effects of BMSCs were quantitated by measuring apoptosis, autophagy, inflammatory markers, and retinal-blood barrier permeability. The distribution and fate of BMSC were qualitatively examined using real-time fundus imaging, and retinal flat mounts.\nIntravitreal delivery of BMSCs significantly improved recovery of the ERG a- and b-waves, OP, negative STR, and P2, and attenuated apoptosis as evidenced by decreased TUNEL and caspase-3 protein levels. BMSCs significantly increased autophagy, decreased inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6), and diminished retinal vascular permeability. BMSCs persisted in the vitreous and were also found within ischemic retina.\nTaken together, our results indicate that intravitreal injection of BMSCs rescued the retina from ischemic damage in a rat model. The mechanisms include suppression of apoptosis, attenuation of inflammation and vascular permeability, and preservation of autophagy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002982","authors":["Mathew, Biji","Poston, Jacqueline N.","Dreixler, John C.","Torres, Leianne","Lopez, Jasmine","Zelkha, Ruth","Balyasnikova, Irina","Lesniak, Maciej S.","Roth, Steven","Biji Mathew","Jacqueline N.
