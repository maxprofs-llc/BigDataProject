A total of 126 HBV carriers (46.2%) harbored pre-S deletions. The DNA sequences of pre-S deletion mutants from 43 age-matched genotype B (HBV\/B)-infected carriers and 43 age-matched genotype C (HBV\/C)-infected carriers were further examined, aligned, and compared.\nNo significant difference was observed in the mean age distribution (P = 0.464), male sex (P = 0.805), viral load (P = 0.635), or BCP mutation (P = 0.117) between the HBV\/B and HBV\/C groups. However, the rate of PC mutation was signi\ufb01cantly higher in the HBV\/B-infected carriers than in the HBV\/C-infected carriers (P = 0.003). Both genotypes exhibited a high rate of deletion in the C-terminal half of the pre-S1 region and N-terminus of the pre-S2 region (86.0% and 79.1% in the HBV\/B group; 69.8% and 72.1% in the HBV\/C group, respectively). Epitope mapping showed that deletion in several epitope sites was frequent in both genotypes, particularly pS1-BT and pS2-B2. Conversely, the rate of pS2-B1 deletion was significantly higher in the HBV\/B group (72.1% vs 37.2%, P = 0.002), and the rate of pS2-T deletion was significantly higher in the HBV\/C group (48.8% vs 25.6%, P = 0.044). Functional mapping showed that the rate of deletion in three functional sites (the nucleocapsid binding site, start codon of M, and site for viral secretion) located in the N-terminus of the pre-S2 region was significantly higher in the HBV\/B group (P < 0.05). One type of N-terminus pre-S1 deletion mutant with deletion of the start codon of the L protein was frequently observed in the HBV\/C group (20.9% vs 9.3%, P = 0.228), particularly in the LC patients (42.9% vs 12.5%). Different patterns of pre-S deletions were also found between the HBV\/B and HBV\/C groups according to different clinical outcomes. In CH patients, deletion in the site for polymerized human serum albumin was more frequent in the HBV\/B group (88.9% vs 36.4%, P = 0.028). In the LC-HCC patients, the rate of deletion in the pre-S2 region was significantly higher in the HBV\/B group than in the HBV\/C group (P < 0.05).\nHBV\/B- and HBV\/C-infected carriers exhibit different patterns of pre-S deletion, which may be associated with the progression of liver diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Bing-Fang Chen"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.v22.i35.8041","first_seen_on":"2017-05-20T10:16:42+00:00","issns":["1007-9327"],"issue":"35","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1495275374,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27672298?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27672298","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Different pre-S deletion patterns and their association with hepatitis B virus genotypes","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/different-pres-deletion-patterns-association-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":6255926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1113105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236335,"mean":12.18298323559,"rank":165983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236335,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3674,"mean":3.1756427988021,"rank":2081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3674,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.5833333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/typeVIpapers\/statuses\/865873796363821056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20326208],"posted_on":"2017-05-20T10:16:14+00:00","author":{"name":"TypeVIpapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"typeVIpapers","tweeter_id":"750239995345170432","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":0},"tweet_id":"865873796363821056"}]}}
