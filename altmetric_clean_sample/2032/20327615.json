Twenty healthy subjects mentally simulated the movement of middle-finger extension in 1P and 3P, while electrocardiogram was recorded. After each task, the level of easiness was self-reported. Participants' motor imagery ability was also assessed through the revised version of Movement Imagery Questionnaire (MIQ-R) and a mental chronometry index. The traditional measures of HRV in the time- and frequency-domain were compared between 1P and 3P tasks by using Student's t-test for dependent samples. The MIQ-R results showed that subjects had the same facility to imagine movements in 1P or 3P. The mental chronometry index revealed a similar temporal course only between 1P and execution, while the 3P strategy had a shorter duration. Additionally, the subjective report was similar between the experimental tasks. Regarding the HRV measures, the low frequency component, in log-transformed unit, was significantly higher (p=0.017) in 1P than 3P, suggesting a higher activity of the sympathetic system during 1P. This log-transformed HRV parameter seems to be more sensitive than normalized values for the assessment of the motor imagery ability, together with questionnaires, scales and mental chronometry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003325","authors":["Talita Peixoto Pinto","Mait\u00ea Mello Russo Ramos","Thiago Lemos","Claudia Domingues Vargas","Luis Aureliano Imbiriba"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.physbeh.2017.05.004","first_seen_on":"2017-05-20T10:51:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00319384"],"journal":"Physiology & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1495277572,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0031938416306102","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0031938416306102&_version=1&md5=4346733ae37ede593996f7052de26a76"],"pmid":"28476285","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","physiology","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Is heart rate variability affected by distinct motor imagery strategies?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heart-rate-variability-affected-distinct-motor-imagery-strategies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8242315,"mean":6.9690880509948,"rank":5961822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1987415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8242315,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235693,"mean":12.211614725998,"rank":151988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":69992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235693,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2518,"mean":9.2805609853,"rank":1864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2518,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":12.19023255814,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
