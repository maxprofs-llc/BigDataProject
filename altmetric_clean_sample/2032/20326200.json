The gradient-descent-based (GDB) learning methods are widely used and verified in the current research. Although the existing GDB multi-spike learning (or spike sequence learning) methods have good performance, they work in an offline manner and still have some limitations. This paper proposes an online GDB spike sequence learning method for spiking neurons that is based on the online adjustment mechanism of real biological neuron synapses. The method constructs error function and calculates the adjustment of synaptic weights as soon as the neurons emit a spike during their running process. We analyze and synthesize desired and actual output spikes to select appropriate input spikes in the calculation of weight adjustment in this paper. The experimental results show that our method obviously improves learning performance compared with the offline learning manner and has certain advantage on learning accuracy compared with other learning methods. Stronger learning ability determines that the method has large pattern storage capacity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000318d","authors":["Yan Xu","Jing Yang","Shuiming Zhong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neunet.2017.04.010","first_seen_on":"2017-05-20T10:16:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["08936080","1879-2782"],"journal":"Neural Networks","last_mentioned_on":1495275376,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28525811?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28525811","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Neuroscience","Computer Science"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"An online supervised learning method based on gradient descent for spiking neurons","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/online-supervised-learning-method-based-gradient-descent-spiking-neurons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":7131283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236335,"mean":12.18298323559,"rank":191601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236335,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":369,"mean":4.1153369565217,"rank":293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":369,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.75,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Ph.
