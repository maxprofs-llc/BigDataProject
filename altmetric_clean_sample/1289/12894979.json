The National POLST Paradigm Task Force recommends that physicians, advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), and physician assistants (PAs) be permitted to execute POLST forms.\nTo investigate the percentage of Oregon POLST forms signed by APRNs, and examine the obstacles faced by states attempting to allow APRNs to sign POLST forms.\nCross-sectional.\n226,101 Oregon POLST Registry forms from 2010 to 2015.\nPOLST forms in the Oregon Registry were matched with signer type (MD, DO, APRN, PA).\n226,101 POLST forms have been added to the Oregon POLST Registry from 2010 to 2015: 85.3% of forms were signed by a physician, 10.9% of forms were signed by an APRN, and 3.8% of forms were signed by a PA. From 2010 to 2015, the overall percentage of POLST forms signed by an APRN has increased from 9.0% in 2010 to 11.9% in 2015. Physicians are authorized signers in all 19 states with endorsed POLST Paradigm programs; 16 of these states also authorize APRN signature, and 3 states (LA, NY, and GA) allow only physicians to sign.\nMore than 10% of Oregon POLST forms are signed by APRNs. Given the need for timely POLST form completion, ideally by a member of the interdisciplinary team who knows the patient's preferences best, these data support authorizing APRNs to complete POLST forms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ea8","authors":["HayesSophia A."],"doi":"10.1089\/jpm.2016.0228","first_seen_on":"2016-10-22T20:53:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1096-6218","1557-7740"],"journal":"Journal of Palliative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1479406196,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/jpm.2016.0228","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/jpm.2016.0228#utm_source=FastTrack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=jpm","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/jpm.2016.0228","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/10.1089\/jpm.2016.0228","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1089\/jpm.2016.0228"],"pmid":"27767363","pubdate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"The Role of Advanced Practice Registered Nurses in the Completion of Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-advanced-practice-registered-nurses-completion-physician-orders-lifesustaining-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":34.7,"score_history":{"1y":34.7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":34.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7705958,"mean":6.6115526533506,"rank":226218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7479570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7705958,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239397,"mean":12.601837900382,"rank":14966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":224416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239397,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1261,"mean":6.559553968254,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1261,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":5.8815384615385,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13,"researcher":4,"practitioner":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":13,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
