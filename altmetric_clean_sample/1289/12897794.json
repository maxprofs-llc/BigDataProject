The clinical prognosis of this cancer is mostly poor owing to delayed diagnosis and a lack of appropriate early detection biomarkers to identify the disease. In the current study, we investigated the role of the S100A7 calcium-binding protein in oral squamous cell carcinoma as an activator of the p38\/MAPK and RAB2A signaling pathway. The aim of the present study was to determine whether S100A7 and RAB2A have a role in tumor progression and to assess their potential as early detection biomarkers for oral cancer. This study elucidated the functional and molecular mechanisms of S100A7 and RAB2A activity in oral cancer, leading us to conclude that S100A7 is the major contributing factor in the occurrence of oral cancer and promotes local tumor progression by activating the MAPK signaling pathway via the RAB2A pathway. We hypothesize that S100A7 affects cell motility and invasion by regulating the RAB2A-associated MAPK signaling cascades. Also, the downregulation of S100A7 expression by RNA interference-mediated silencing inhibits oral cancer cell growth, migration and invasion.Cancer Gene Therapy advance online publication, 21 October 2016; doi:10.1038\/cgt.2016.43.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249b","authors":["K K Dey","R Bharti","G Dey","I Pal","Y Rajesh","S Chavan","S Das","C K Das","B C Jena","P Halder","J G Ray","I Kulavi","M Mandal"],"doi":"10.1038\/cgt.2016.43","first_seen_on":"2016-10-22T23:03:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5500","0929-1903"," 1476-5500"],"journal":"Cancer Gene Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1477105208,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/cgt\/rss\/aop\/~3\/WOiUzxy-4lk\/cgt.2016.43"],"pmid":"27767088","pubdate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oral cancer","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Tumour biomarkers","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","geneticsmedical"],"title":"S100A7 has an oncogenic role in oral squamous cell carcinoma by activating p38\/MAPK and RAB2A signaling pathway","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/s100a7-oncogenic-role-oral-squamous-cell-carcinoma-activating-p38mapk-rab2a-signaling-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":1038097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6472928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236516,"mean":12.571035190157,"rank":50119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":183022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236516,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":343,"mean":4.9667426900585,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":343,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":7.0027777777778,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
