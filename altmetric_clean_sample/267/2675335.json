As a Russian proverb goes \"everything new is well-forgotten old\". In 1958, Dilman proposed that aging and its related diseases are programmed by the hypothalamus. This theory, supported by beautiful experiments, remained unnoticed just to be re-discovered recently. Yet, it does not explain all manifestations of aging. And would organism age without hypothalamus? Do sensing pathways such as MTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) and IKK-beta play a role of a \"molecular hypothalamus\" in every cell? Are hypothalamus-driven alterations simply a part of quasi-programmed aging manifested by hyperfunction and secondary signal-resistance? Here are some answers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbbe","authors":["Blagosklonny MV"],"doi":"10.18632\/aging.100580","first_seen_on":"2014-09-11T13:54:04+00:00","issns":["1945-4589"],"issue":"7","journal":"Aging","last_mentioned_on":1410443606,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23872658"],"pmcid":"PMC3765577","pmid":"23872658","pubdate":"2013-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"M(o)TOR of aging: MTOR as a universal molecular hypothalamus.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/motor-aging-mtor-universal-molecular-hypothalamus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7950520,"mean":6.7152891251438,"rank":6027245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1069996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7950520,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187213,"mean":7.7130472619279,"rank":122181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187213,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":523,"mean":14.636651340996,"rank":347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":523,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":22.146,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
