An exciting new experimental design for genome scans is to measure the change in allele frequency before and after contemporary selection within a generation, from a single population. The most widely-used methods, however, have two major limitations: they are based on testing one locus at a time, and they only have power to uncover loci that have evolved under relatively strong selection. On the other hand, complex quantitative traits are common in nature and are caused by several loci of small effect. Selection on a quantitative trait at the phenotypic level is predicted to be accompanied by subtle allele frequency changes in many loci that covary (a polygenic soft sweep), rather than a large, single-effect allele (a selective sweep). In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Bourret et al. (2014) measure the contemporary response to natural selection across the genome in multiple cohorts of Atlantic salmon during their first year at sea. They introduce a multilocus framework based on groups of markers that covary in their genotypic distribution. While the traditional, single-locus approach did not find evidence for repeated patterns of selection, the multivariate approach found that a group of covarying SNPs was selected for in different cohorts at one site. Their multilocus framework has potential to be a more fruitful approach for uncovering the genomic basis of adaptation in quantitative traits, although caution should be applied as the framework has yet to be validated with simulated data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037bc","authors":["Lotterhos, Katie E.","Schaal, Sara M."],"doi":"10.1111\/mec.12853","endpage":"4437","first_seen_on":"2014-09-11T05:52:58+00:00","issns":["1365-294X","0962-1083"],"issue":"18","journal":"Molecular Ecology","last_mentioned_on":1414678690,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mec.12853\/abstract;jsessionid=C412D8B60FA27CD5300A275276B5CCCD.f02t02","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25208503?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/mec.12853"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mec.12853\/pdf","pmid":"25208503","pubdate":"2014-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4435","subjects":["molecularbiology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Genome scans for the contemporary response to selection in quantitative traits","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genome-scans-contemporary-response-selection-quantitative-traits-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4509149,"mean":5.2377591184699,"rank":381299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4127148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4509149,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116349,"mean":8.376726699213,"rank":14310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":102015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116349,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2399,"mean":6.059259382819,"rank":353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":2040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2399,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":11.063238095238,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
