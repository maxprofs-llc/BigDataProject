A role for Mdmx (or Mdm4) as a key negative regulator of p53 function in vivo has been established. However, a direct contribution of Mdmx to tumor formation remains to be demonstrated. Here we show that retrovirus-mediated Mdmx overexpression allows primary mouse embryonic fibroblast immortalization and leads to neoplastic transformation in combination with HRas(V12). Furthermore, the human Mdmx ortholog, Hdmx, was found to be overexpressed in a significant percentage of various human tumors and amplified in 5% of primary breast tumors, all of which retained wild-type p53. Hdmx was also amplified and highly expressed in MCF-7, a breast cancer cell line harboring wild-type p53, and interfering RNA-mediated reduction of Hdmx markedly inhibited the growth potential of these cells in a p53-dependent manner. Together, these results make Hdmx a new putative drug target for cancer therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Davide Danovi","Erik Meulmeester","Diego Pasini","Domenico Migliorini","Maria Capra","Ruth Frenk","Petra de Graaf","Sarah Francoz","Patrizia Gasparini","Alberto Gobbi","Kristian Helin","Pier Giuseppe Pelicci","Aart G.
