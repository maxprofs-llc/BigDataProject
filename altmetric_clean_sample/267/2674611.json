Firstly, this algorithm employs motion vector (MV) to extract temporal saliency region through fast MV noise filtering and translational MV checking procedure. Secondly, spatial saliency region is detected based on optimal prediction mode distributions in I-frame and P-frame. Then, it combines the spatiotemporal saliency detection results to define the video region of interest (VROI). The simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm can avoid a large amount of computation work in the visual perception characteristics analysis processing compared with other existing algorithms; it also has better performance in saliency detection for videos and can realize fast saliency detection. It can be used as a part of the video standard codec at medium-to-low bit-rates or combined with other algorithms in fast video coding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088c9","authors":["Liu P","Jia K"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/293681","first_seen_on":"2014-09-11T10:15:43+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"","journal":"The Scientific World Journal","last_mentioned_on":1410430506,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24489495?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC3885321","pmid":"24489495","pubdate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Low-complexity saliency detection algorithm for fast perceptual video coding.","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lowcomplexity-saliency-detection-algorithm-fast-perceptual-video-coding"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":2327214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1536217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116312,"mean":8.0807334302002,"rank":56189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":46226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116312,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1319,"mean":1.8050424886191,"rank":442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1319,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":2.7072592592593,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/biosoft_paper\/status\/510008624861560832","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2674611],"posted_on":"2014-09-11T10:15:06+00:00","author":{"name":"BioSoftwarePapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509407452022833152\/xBfqMRBS_normal.png","id_on_source":"biosoft_paper","tweeter_id":"2800318034","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":11},"tweet_id":"510008624861560832"}]}}
