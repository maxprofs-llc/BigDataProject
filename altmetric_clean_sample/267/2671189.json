This sequence exhibits surprisingly low A+T content (57.1%), containing genes for 13 energy pathway proteins, a small and a large subunit rRNAs, and methionine and tryptophan tRNAs. Mitochondrial ancestral medusozoan gene order (AMGO) was found in the C. sowerbyi, as those found in Cubaia aphrodite (Hydrozoa, Trachylina, Limnomedusae), discomedusan Scyphozoa and Staurozoa. The genes of C. sowerbyi mtDNA are arranged in two clusters with opposite transcriptional polarities, whereby transcription proceeds toward the ends of the DNA molecule. Identical inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) flank the ends of the mitochondrial DNA molecule, a characteristic typical of medusozoans. In addition, two open reading frames (ORFs) of 354 and 1611 bp in length were found downstream of the large subunit rRNA gene, similar to the two ORFs of ORF314 and polB discovered in the linear mtDNA of C. aphrodite, discomedusan Scyphozoa and Staurozoa. Phylogenetic analyses of C. sowerbyi and other cnidarians were carried out based on both nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences of the 13 mitochondrial energy pathway genes. Our working hypothesis supports the monophyletic Medusozoa being a sister group to Octocorallia (Cnidaria, Anthozoa). Within Medusozoa, the phylogenetic analysis suggests that Staurozoa may be the earliest diverging class and the sister group of all other medusozoans. Cubozoa and coronate Scyphozoa form a clade that is the sister group of Hydrozoa plus discomedusan Scyphozoa. Hydrozoa is the sister group of discomedusan Scyphozoa. Semaeostomeae is a paraphyletic clade with Rhizostomeae, while Limnomedusae (Trachylina) is the sister group of hydroidolinans and may be the earliest diverging lineage among Hydrozoa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Zou H","Zhang J","Li W","Wu S","Wang G","Hong Zou","Jin Zhang","Wenxiang Li","Shangong Wu","Guitang Wang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0051465","first_seen_on":"2014-09-10T11:37:45+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1483990408,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23240028?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0051465","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0051465","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3519871"],"pmid":"23240028","pubdate":"2012-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e51465","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Mitochondrial Genome of the Freshwater Jellyfish  Craspedacusta sowerbyi  and Phylogenetics of Medusozoa","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mitochondrial-genome-freshwater-jellyfish-craspedacusta-sowerbyi-phylogenetics-medusozoa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":1806313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6208414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187888,"mean":7.7976611899708,"rank":44903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":142468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187888,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111956,"mean":10.493965861284,"rank":33006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":78438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111956,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2617,"mean":17.634880733945,"rank":939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2617,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
