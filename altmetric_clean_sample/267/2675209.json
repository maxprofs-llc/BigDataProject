Upon closure of the two domains, the substrate and the co-factor are brought into precise relative orientation and close proximity, with a distance between the C2 atom of the substrate and the C4N atom of the pyridine ring of the co-factor of approximately 3.0 \u00c5. The structure further shows binding of a K(+) ion close to the active site, and provides an explanation for its known activating effect. Hence, this structure is an excellent mimic for the enzymatically competent complex. Using high-level QM\/MM calculations, it may be demonstrated that, in the observed arrangement of the reactants, transfer of a hydride from the C2 atom of 3-isopropylmalate to the C4N atom of the pyridine ring of NAD(+) is easily possible, with an activation energy of approximately 15 kcal\u00b7mol(-1) . The activation energy increases by approximately 4-6 kcal\u00b7mol(-1) when the K(+) ion is omitted from the calculations. In the most plausible scenario, prior to hydride transfer the \u03b5-amino group of Lys185 acts as a general base in the reaction, aiding the deprotonation reaction of 3-isopropylmalate prior to hydride transfer by employing a low-barrier proton shuttle mechanism involving a water molecule.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b6","authors":["Pall\u00f3, Anna","Ol\u00e1h, Julianna","Gr\u00e1czer, \u00c9va","Merli, Angelo","Z\u00e1vodszky, P\u00e9ter","Weiss, Manfred S.","Vas, M\u00e1ria"],"doi":"10.1111\/febs.13044","endpage":"5076","first_seen_on":"2014-09-11T13:12:36+00:00","issns":["1742-4658","1742-464X"],"issue":"22","journal":"FEBS Journal","last_mentioned_on":1410441134,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/febs.13044\/abstract;jsessionid=075C5636B7E12A332422ACF57818FC98.f04t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/febs.13044"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/febs.13044\/pdf","pmid":"25211160","pubdate":"2014-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"5063","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Structural and energetic basis of isopropylmalate dehydrogenase enzyme catalysis","type":"article","volume":"281","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-energetic-basis-isopropylmalate-dehydrogenase-enzyme-catalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6357994,"mean":5.9828505243713,"rank":4468908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1658613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6357994,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156258,"mean":8.2038693434536,"rank":97879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":51435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156258,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1753,"mean":1.6599292237443,"rank":803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1753,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":1.1398181818182,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
