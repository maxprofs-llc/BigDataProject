The genus Ovabunda Alderslade, 2001 was recently established to accommodate previous Xenia species with sclerites comprised of a mass of minute corpuscle-shaped microscleres. The aim of the present study was to examine type material of Xenia species in order to verify their generic affiliation. We present here a comprehensive account of the genus Ovabunda, using scanning electron microscopy to depict sclerite microstructure. We assign three Xenia species to the genus: O. ainex comb. n., O. gohari comb. n., and O. crenata comb. n.; and synonymize several other species of Ovabunda. We provide a key to Ovabunda species and conclude that they are mainly confined to the Red Sea, with some occurrence in the West Indian Ocean.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["Hal\u00e1sz A","McFadden CS","Aharonovich D","Toonen R","Benayahu Y"],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.373.6511","first_seen_on":"2014-09-10T12:37:23+00:00","issns":["1313-2989"],"issue":"373","journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1410352633,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24493958?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24493958","pubdate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"A revision of the octocoral genus Ovabunda Alderslade, 2001 (Anthozoa, Octocorallia, Xeniidae).","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/revision-octocoral-genus-ovabunda-alderslade-2001-anthozoa-octocorallia-xeniidae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4744962,"mean":5.7031291549112,"rank":3972969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4744962,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122726,"mean":8.5457166510492,"rank":98354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122726,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1660,"mean":12.677657625075,"rank":1581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1660,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":11.647647058824,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
