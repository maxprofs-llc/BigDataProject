The interplay between dendritic nonlinearities and recurrent cortical microcircuit activity in shaping network response is largely unknown. We simulated detailed conductance-based models of TTCs forming recurrent microcircuits that were interconnected as found experimentally; the network was embedded in a realistic background synaptic activity. TTCs microcircuits significantly amplified brief thalamocortical inputs; this cortical gain was mediated by back-propagation activated N-methyl-d-aspartate depolarizations and dendritic back-propagation-activated Ca(2+) spike firing, ignited by the coincidence of thalamic-activated somatic spike and local dendritic synaptic inputs, originating from the cortical microcircuit. Surprisingly, dendritic nonlinearities in TTCs microcircuits linearly multiplied thalamic inputs-amplifying them while maintaining input selectivity. Our findings indicate that dendritic nonlinearities are pivotal in controlling the gain and the computational functions of TTCs microcircuits, which serve as a dominant output source for the neocortex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e36","authors":["Etay Hay","Idan Segev"],"doi":"10.1093\/cercor\/bhu200","first_seen_on":"2014-09-11T17:28:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-2199"],"journal":"Cerebral Cortex","last_mentioned_on":1410659084,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25205662?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/cercor.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/09\/09\/cercor.bhu200.long"],"pmid":"25205662","pubdate":"2014-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Dendritic Excitability and Gain Control in Recurrent Cortical Microcircuits","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dendritic-excitability-gain-control-recurrent-cortical-microcircuits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":1684303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2798338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116311,"mean":8.0806494368499,"rank":35752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":79766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116311,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1773,"mean":6.5026726862302,"rank":792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1773,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":13.4067,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
