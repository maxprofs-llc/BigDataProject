However, CO2 insufflation might also lead to CO2 retention in the human body. It was recently shown that this side effect does not occur in unsedated patients, but that sedation leads to impaired respiration. Sedated patients may therefore be more prone to CO2 retention. This randomized, double-blinded study was designed to investigate whether CO2 insufflation leads to CO2 retention in sedated patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027c5","authors":["Bretthauer M","Lynge AB","Thiis-Evensen E","Hoff G","Fausa O","Aabakken L","M.
