Compared to the tight multisystem coordination during exercise, evidence of between-systems cross talk in the early post exercise is still lacking. This study was aimed at identifying possible interactions between multiple systems following strenuous physical exercise (Ironman race) performed by twenty well-trained triathletes. Cardiac hemodynamics, left ventricle systolic and diastolic function and heart rate variability were measured along with plasma concentrations of immune messengers (cytokines and C-reactive protein) and stress-related hormones (catecholamines and cortisol) both 24h before and within 20 min after the race. Observed changes in antiinflammatory pathways, stress-related hormones and cardiovascular function were in line with previous findings; moreover, correlating parameters' changes (post versus pre-race) highlighted a dependence of cardiovascular function on the post-race biohumoral milieu: in particular, individual post-race variations of heart rate and diastolic function were strongly correlated with individual variations of anti-inflammatory cytokines, while individual baroreflex sensitivity changes were linked to IL-8 increase. Multiple correlations between anti-inflammatory cytokines and catecholamines were also found according with the autonomic regulation of immune function. Observed post-race cytokine and hormone levels were presumptively representative of the increases reached at the effort end while the cardiovascular parameters after the race were measured during the cardiovascular recovery; thus, results suggest that sustained strenuous exercise produced a stereotyped cardiovascular early recovery, whose speed could be conditioned by the immune and stress-related hormonal milieu.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd1f","authors":["Menicucci D","Piarulli A","Mastorci F","Sebastiani L","Laurino M","Garbella E","Castagnini C","Pellegrini S","Lubrano V","Bernardi G","Metelli M","Bedini R","L'abbate A","Pingitore A","Gemignani A"],"doi":"10.4449\/aib.v151i3.1523","first_seen_on":"2014-09-10T15:07:54+00:00","issns":["0003-9829"],"issue":"3","journal":"Archives italiennes de biologie","last_mentioned_on":1410361630,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24599630?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=buffer16f1f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"24599630","pubdate":"2014-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Interactions between immune, stress-related hormonal and cardiovascular systems following strenuous physical exercise.","type":"article","volume":"151","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interactions-between-immune-stressrelated-hormonal-cardiovascular-systems-following-strenuous-physic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4237792,"mean":5.1309550690165,"rank":3381694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":120426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4237792,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110385,"mean":8.2992428975215,"rank":88149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110385,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.5556271186441,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.26,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
