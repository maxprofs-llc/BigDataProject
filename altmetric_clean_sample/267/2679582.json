Therefore, we developed a 1-yr intervention aiming to prevent the development of ED among adolescent elite athletes by targeting athletes and their coaches. The separate part of the intervention targeting the coaches was designed to provide knowledge and strategies regarding healthy nutrition, eating behavior, and ED (symptoms, identification, management and prevention). In this trial, we examined the effect of the educational program on the coaches' knowledge and management index in three content areas (nutrition, weight-regulation, and ED). We also examined their subjective evaluation of their ED knowledge.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5033cf058f61000309f","authors":["Martinsen M","Sherman RT","Thompson RA","Sundgot-Borgen J"],"doi":"10.1249\/mss.0000000000000489","first_seen_on":"2014-09-12T19:35:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise","last_mentioned_on":1458567713,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25202842"],"pmid":"25202842","pubdate":"2014-09-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Coaches' Knowledge and Management of Eating Disorders: A Randomized Controlled Trial.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coaches-knowledge-management-eating-disorders-randomized-controlled-trial-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7419920,"mean":6.4520289205274,"rank":3601172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3631451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7419920,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185332,"mean":7.6285297117052,"rank":81437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":96879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185332,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2853,"mean":16.968514025245,"rank":2153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2853,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":37.74128358209,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
