Their chemical structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analyses. The cytotoxicity of the isolated compounds towards the human mammary carcinoma cell line MCF-7 was determined by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and compounds 4 and 1 were found to be the most toxic of the four, with IC50 values of 8.8 and 11.7 microM, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9233cf058f61000dae5","authors":["Ayyad SE","Angawy R","Alarif WM","Saqer EA","Badria FA"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-10T14:48:16+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3-4","journal":"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Naturforschung Teil C Biochemie Biophysik Biologie Virologie","last_mentioned_on":1410360426,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24873032?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24873032","pubdate":"2014-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Cytotoxic polyacetylenes from the Red Sea sponge Siphonochalina siphonella.","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytotoxic-polyacetylenes-red-sea-sponge-siphonochalina-siphonella"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2294817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1620426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116212,"mean":8.1164552236881,"rank":56194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":47042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116212,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.5030303030303,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
