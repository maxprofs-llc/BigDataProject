In the present study, we initially investigated the effect of intracerebroventricular infusion of arginine (0.1, 0.5 and 1.5 mM solution) on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity and on some parameters of oxidative stress, namely thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) and total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) in the hippocampus of rats. Results showed that 1.5 mM arginine solution significantly increases TBA-RS and reduces Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity and TRAP in the rat hippocampus. We also evaluated the influence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and antioxidants, namely alpha-tocopherol plus ascorbic acid, on the effects elicited by arginine on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity, TBA-RS and TRAP. Results showed that treatment with alpha-tocopherol plus ascorbic acid per se did not alter these parameters but prevented these effects. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular infusion of L-NAME prevented the inhibition caused by arginine on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity, as well as the increased of TBA-RS. Our findings indicate that intracerebroventricular infusion of arginine induces oxidative stress in rat hippocampus and that the inhibition of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity caused by this amino acid was probably mediated by NO and\/or its derivatives ONOO(-) and\/or other free radicals. Finally, we suggest that the administration of antioxidants should be considered as an adjuvant therapy to specific diets in hyperargininemia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002427","authors":["Delwing D","Delwing D","Bavaresco CS","Wyse AT"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.brainres.2007.11.052","first_seen_on":"2014-09-11T12:21:12+00:00","issns":["0006-8993"],"issue":"","journal":"Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1410438005,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18190896"],"pmid":"18190896","pubdate":"2008-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Protective effect of nitric oxide synthase inhibition or antioxidants on brain oxidative damage caused by intracerebroventricular arginine administration.","type":"article","volume":"1193","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protective-effect-nitric-oxide-synthase-inhibition-antioxidants-brain-oxidative-damage-caused-intrac-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3110406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1004079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116312,"mean":8.0806986097618,"rank":74447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":30642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116312,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2529,"mean":2.7950862341772,"rank":1674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2529,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":1.7791232876712,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
