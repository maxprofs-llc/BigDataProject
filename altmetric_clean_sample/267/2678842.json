About one-third of PTBs result from the preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Up to the present, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying PPROM are not clearly understood. Here, we investigated the differential expression of long chain non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in placentas of PTBs with PPROM, and their possible involvement in the pathogenic pathways leading to PPROM. A total number of 1954, 776, and 1050 lncRNAs were identified with a microarray from placentas of PPROM (group A), which were compared to full-term birth (FTB) (group B), PTB (group C), and premature rupture of membrane (PROM) (group D) at full-term, respectively. Instead of investigating the individual pathogenic role of each lncRNA involved in the molecular mechanism underlying PPROM, we have focused on investigating the metabolic pathways and their functions to explore what is the likely association and how they are possibly involved in the development of PPROM. Six groups, including up-regulation and down-regulation in the comparisons of A vs. B, A vs. C, and A vs. D, of pathways were analyzed. Our results showed that 22 pathways were characterized as up-regulated 7 down-regulated in A vs. C, 18 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated in A vs. D, and 33 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated in A vs. B. Functional analysis showed pathways of infection and inflammatory response, ECM-receptor interactions, apoptosis, actin cytoskeleton, and smooth muscle contraction are the major pathogenic mechanisms involved in the development of PPROM. Characterization of these pathways through identification of lncRNAs opened new avenues for further investigating the epigenomic mechanisms of lncRNAs in PPROM as well as PTB.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Luo X","Shi Q","Gu Y","Pan J","Hua M","Liu M","Dong Z","Zhang M","Wang L","Gu Y","Zhong J","Zhao X","Jenkins EC","Brown WT","Zhong N"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0079897","first_seen_on":"2014-09-12T14:16:37+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1410542674,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24312190?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24312190"],"pmcid":"PMC3842261","pmid":"24312190","pubdate":"2013-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"LncRNA Pathway Involved in Premature Preterm Rupture of Membrane (PPROM): An Epigenomic Approach to Study the Pathogenesis of Reproductive Disorders.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lncrna-pathway-involved-premature-preterm-rupture-membrane-pprom-epigenomic-approach-study-pathogene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3110370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1004051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116670,"mean":8.0961854820047,"rank":74639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":30747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116670,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80033,"mean":8.2613878948421,"rank":55351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80033,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2225,"mean":15.975966726619,"rank":1619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2225,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
