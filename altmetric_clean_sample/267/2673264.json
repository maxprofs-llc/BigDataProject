Meta-analytic reviews reveal wide variation in therapist-attributable variability in psychotherapy outcomes, with most studies reporting therapist effects in the region of 5% to 10% and some finding minimal to no therapist effects. However, all except one study to date have been conducted in high-intensity or mixed intervention groups; therefore, there is scarcity of evidence on therapist effects in brief low-intensity psychological interventions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Shehzad Ali","Elizabeth Littlewood","Dean McMillan","Jaime Delgadillo","Alfonso Miranda","Tim Croudace","Simon Gilbody","Ali S","Littlewood E","McMillan D","Delgadillo J","Miranda A","Croudace T","Gilbody S","Jerson Laks"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0099658","first_seen_on":"2014-09-11T00:32:58+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1410958984,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0099658"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0099658.pdf","pmid":"25207881","pubdate":"2014-09-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e99658","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Heterogeneity in Patient-Reported Outcomes following Low-Intensity Mental Health Interventions: A Multilevel Analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0099658","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heterogeneity-patientreported-outcomes-following-lowintensity-mental-health-interventions-multilevel-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7374182,"mean":6.407190734262,"rank":1674340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5681699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7374182,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184399,"mean":7.6037614941596,"rank":45825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":137888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184399,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105520,"mean":10.162439882865,"rank":32328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":72735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105520,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2580,"mean":17.434952307096,"rank":965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2580,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
