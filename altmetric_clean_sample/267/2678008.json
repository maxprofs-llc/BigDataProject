We further explored this repertoire using PCR-sequencing and culture in seven individuals living in four tropical countries. A total of 41 microeukaryotes including 38 different fungal species and three protists were detected. Four fungal species, Davidiella tassiana, Davidiella sp., Corticiaceae sp., and Penicillium sp., were uniquely detected by culture; 27 fungal species were uniquely detected using PCR-sequencing and Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Trichosporon asahii, Clavispora lusitaniae, Debaryomyces hansenii, Malassezia restricta, and Malassezia sp. were detected using both molecular and culture methods. Fourteen microeukaryotes were shared by the seven individuals, whereas 27 species were found in only one individual, including 11 species in Amazonia, nine species in Polynesia, five species in India, and two species in Senegal. These data support a worldwide distribution of Malassezia sp., Trichosporon sp., and Candida sp. in the gut mycobiome. Here, 13 fungal species and two protists, Stentor roeseli and Vorticella campanula, were observed for first time in the human gut. This study revealed a previously unsuspected diversity in the repertoire of human gut microeukaryotes, suggesting spots for further exploring this repertoire.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Nina Gouba","Didier Raoult","Michel Drancourt"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0106994","first_seen_on":"2014-09-12T10:04:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1432645761,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25210972?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0106994","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25210972?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25210972","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Eukaryote culturomics of the gut reveals new species.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/eukaryote-culturomics-gut-reveals-new-species"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5148263,"mean":6.0867260621181,"rank":2718897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1758183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5148263,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136612,"mean":8.5465262240963,"rank":69732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":51355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136612,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90728,"mean":9.4121756919109,"rank":51382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":29559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90728,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2390,"mean":17.1765056509,"rank":1566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2390,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
