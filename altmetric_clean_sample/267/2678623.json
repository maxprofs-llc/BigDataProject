Overall, 67% [95% confidence interval (CI): 66, 68] were anemic (hemoglobin <110 g\/L), ranging from 54% in the West Bank to 75% in Syria. The following factors were significantly associated with anemia in one or more of three age groups (6-11.9, 12-23.9 and 24-35.9 mo) by logistic regression: living in Syria, Lebanon, or Gaza [with prevalence odds ratios (POR) in the range of 1.4-2.6 depending on the age group and area, relative to children living in Jordan]; never having been breast-fed (POR = 1.7); male sex (POR = 1.2); maternal illiteracy (POR = 1.4 relative to those with >\/=6 y of education); having a recent (within 2 wk) or current episode of fever or diarrhea; and stunting. Recent or current illness and stunting interacted in two age groups with the general trend of stunted children with recent or current illness having high POR. Early childhood anemia is associated with factors reflecting poor socioeconomic status and recent diarrheal and febrile illnesses in Palestinian refugee camps.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["K Hassan","K M Sullivan","R Yip","B A Woodruff"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-12T12:58:54+00:00","issns":["0022-3166"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1410526688,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9349847"],"pmid":"9349847","pubdate":"1997-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Factors associated with anemia in refugee children.","type":"article","volume":"127","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-associated-anemia-refugee-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4243704,"mean":5.1312618128706,"rank":2383632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1095176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4243704,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110958,"mean":8.3266445920492,"rank":61281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":29085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110958,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2958,"mean":7.3710050727088,"rank":1991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2958,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":11.076086956522,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
