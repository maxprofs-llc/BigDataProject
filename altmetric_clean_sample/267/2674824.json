The history and state-of-the-art of lentiviral vector development are summarized and the recent advancements for a number of selected diseases are reviewed in detail. Past retroviral vector trials for these diseases, the most recent improvements of lentiviral vector platforms and their application in preclinical development as well as ongoing clinical trials are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000585b","authors":["Aisha V Sauer","Biagio Di Lorenzo","Nicola Carriglio","Alessandro Aiuti"],"doi":"10.1097\/aci.0000000000000114","first_seen_on":"2014-09-11T10:55:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-6322","1528-4050"],"journal":"Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology","last_mentioned_on":1412073394,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25207699","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-allergy\/pages\/articleviewer.aspx?article=99514&issue=00000&type=abstract&year=9000","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/co-allergy\/_layouts\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&issue=00000&article=99514&utm_content=buffer80788&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/co-allergy\/_layouts\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?article=99514&issue=00000&year=9000"],"pmid":"25207699","pubdate":"2014-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Progress in gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies using lentiviral vectors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/progress-gene-therapy-primary-immunodeficiencies-using-lentiviral-vectors-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8445734,"mean":7.1009458620031,"rank":3892870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4468131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8445734,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189796,"mean":7.9217899733926,"rank":73262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":113661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189796,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":866,"mean":3.2026104046243,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":866,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.9426470588235,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
