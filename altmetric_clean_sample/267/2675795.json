There are obvious links between the cervical proprioceptors and the musculoskeletal system, but links to the autonomic nervous, vestibular, and visual systems and influence on pain modulation are important. Postural control may have potential to alter other systems and affect pain and should be considered as one of the processes that might influence the transition to chronicity after a whiplash trauma. Future research should monitor the effect that addressing abnormal cervical afferent input has on not just dizziness and postural control but other symptoms such as altered pain processing and psychological distress.\nThe causes of transition into chronicity after a whiplash trauma are present early and appear to be multifactorial. Pain sensitivity and psychosocial distress have recently been considered but postural deficits and the symptom of dizziness also appear to have a role.It is recommended that future research address these issues to further the understanding of the transition to chronicity after a whiplash trauma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Julia Treleaven"],"doi":"10.1097\/brs.0b013e3182387f78","endpage":"S217","first_seen_on":"2014-09-11T16:30:34+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0362-2436","1528-1159"],"issue":"25 Suppl","journal":"Spine","last_mentioned_on":1499971866,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Abstract\/2011\/12011\/Dizziness,_Unsteadiness,_Visual_Disturbances,_and.8.aspx","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/BRS.0b013e3182387f78","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22020615"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/2011\/12011\/Dizziness,_Unsteadiness,_Visual_Disturbances,_and.8.pdf","pmid":"22020615","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S211","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Dizziness, Unsteadiness, Visual Disturbances, and Postural Control: Implications for the Transition to Chronic Symptoms After a Whiplash Trauma","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dizziness-unsteadiness-visual-disturbances-postural-control-implications-transition-chronic-symptoms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204513,"mean":6.9458687178401,"rank":3445115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4707347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204513,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188701,"mean":7.8681792050877,"rank":62981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":123959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188701,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4957,"mean":5.835316787732,"rank":2198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4957,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":6.9022352941176,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
