Increasing the range of therapeutic options optimizes outcomes and facilitates patient management. An international, multi-center, two-phase study investigated the efficacy and safety of slow-release oral morphine (SROM) versus methadone in patients receiving methadone therapy for opioid dependence. In phase 1 (two way cross-over, 11weeks each period) patients were randomized to SROM or methadone oral solution. In phase 2 (25weeks), patients continued treatment with SROM (group A) or switched from methadone to SROM (group B). In total, 211 out of 276 completed phase 1 and 198 entered phase 2 (n=95 group A, n=103 group B). Treatment with both SROM and methadone was well tolerated. However, the mean QTc-interval associated with methadone was significantly longer than that under SROM. Higher treatment satisfaction, fewer cravings for heroin, and lower mental stress were reported with SROM. This study adds a significant further weight of evidence that SROM is an effective and well tolerated long-term maintenance treatment for opioid dependence with a beneficial risk profile compared to methadone regarding cardiac effects and supports its clinical utility.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f45","doi":"10.1016\/j.jsat.2014.05.012","first_seen_on":"2014-09-12T17:29:00+00:00","issns":["0740-5472"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1410542892,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0740547214000944"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journalofsubstanceabusetreatment.com\/article\/S0740547214000944\/pdf","pmid":"25064422","pubdate":"2014-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"275","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Safety and tolerability of slow-release oral morphine versus methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-tolerability-slowrelease-oral-morphine-versus-methadone-treatment-opioid-dependence-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4243704,"mean":5.1312618128706,"rank":3385869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":121553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4243704,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110958,"mean":8.3266445920492,"rank":88643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110958,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":530,"mean":3.0582495274102,"rank":422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":530,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.70833333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
