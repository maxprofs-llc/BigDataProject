Such an approach is based on the ab initio framework provided by density functional theory and the construction of a tight-binding effective model via Wannier transformation. The final Hamiltonian includes coupling of the electrons to the crystals phonons, which are also calculated from density functional theory. We apply this methodology to the case of durene, a small \u03c0-conjugated molecule, which forms a high-mobility herringbone-stacked crystal. We show that accounting correctly for dispersive forces is fundamental for obtaining a high-quality phonon spectrum, in agreement with experiments. Then, the mobility as a function of temperature is calculated along different crystallographic directions and the phonons most responsible for the scattering are identified.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["Carlo Motta","Stefano Sanvito"],"doi":"10.1021\/ct500390a","first_seen_on":"2014-09-10T19:35:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-9618","1549-9626"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","last_mentioned_on":1410377764,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ct500390a"],"pmid":"26588155","pubdate":"2014-08-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"startpage":"140828121130007","title":"Charge transport properties of durene crystals from first principles","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/charge-transport-properties-durene-crystals-firstprinciples"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2897091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1452746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116213,"mean":8.20887095997,"rank":71511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":40159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116213,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2251,"mean":1.2046933333333,"rank":742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2251,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":1.6643571428571,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
