This research was carried out in two stages: the objectives of the first stage were (1) to identify the existing relationships between the level of anxiety, the frequency of automatic negative thoughts, and unconditional self-acceptance and (2) to capture the existing differences regarding these variables between people diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and those with no such medical history. Methods. The sample made up of 50 subjects filled out the following three questionnaires: the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire, and the Unconditional Self-Acceptance Questionnaire. Results. Psychological anxiety is positively correlated with automatic negative thoughts, while unconditional self-acceptance is negatively correlated with both psychological anxiety and somatic anxiety as well as with automatic negative thoughts. All studied variables were significantly different in rheumatoid arthritis as compared to the control population. Conclusions. The results showed the presence to a greater extent of anxiety and automatic negative thoughts, along with reduced unconditional self-acceptance among people with rheumatoid arthritis. Intervention on these variables through support and counseling can lead to reducing anxiety and depression, to altering the coping styles, and, implicitly, to improving the patients' quality of life.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007aae","authors":["Palo&#x219;, Ramona","Ramona Palo\u0219","Loredana V\u00ee\u0219cu"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/317259","first_seen_on":"2014-09-11T09:34:41+00:00","issns":["2090-5467","2090-5475"],"journal":"ISRN Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1463405400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1155\/2014\/317259","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4005021\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/isrn\/2014\/317259.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4005021","pmid":"25028611","pubdate":"2014-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Anxiety, Automatic Negative Thoughts, and Unconditional Self-Acceptance in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Preliminary Study","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anxiety-automatic-negative-thoughts-unconditional-selfacceptance-rheumatoid-arthritis-preliminary-st"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8021884,"mean":6.7888390820419,"rank":499969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7517890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8021884,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187782,"mean":7.7741329633991,"rank":14812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":172899,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187782,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.0957777777778,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
