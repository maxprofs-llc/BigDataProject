Agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in ASM that involve both influx and SR mechanisms have been previously demonstrated. In nonexcitable cells, [Ca(2+)]i oscillations involve Ca(2+) influx via arachidonic acid (AA) -stimulated channels, which show similarities to store-operated Ca(2+) entry, although their molecular identity remains undetermined. Little is known about AA-regulated Ca(2+) channels or their regulation in ASM. In enzymatically dissociated human ASM cells loaded with the Ca(2+) indicator, fura-2, AA (1-10 \u03bcM) triggered [Ca(2+)]i oscillations that were inhibited by removal of extracellular Ca(2+). Other fatty acids, such as the diacylglycerol analog, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-SN-glycerol, oleic acid, and palmitic acid (10 \u03bcM each), failed to elicit similar [Ca(2+)]i responses. Preincubation with LaCl3 (1 \u03bcM or 1 mM) inhibited AA-induced oscillations. Inhibition of receptor-operated channels (SKF96,365 [10 \u03bcM]), lipoxygenase (zileuton [10 \u03bcM]), or cyclooxygenase (indomethacin [10 \u03bcM]) did not affect oscillation parameters. Inhibition of SR Ca(2+) release (ryanodine [10 \u03bcM] or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor inhibitor, xestospongin C [1 \u03bcM]) decreased [Ca(2+)]i oscillation frequency and amplitude. Small interfering RNA against caveolin-1, stromal interaction molecule 1, or Orai3 (20 nM each) reduced the frequency and amplitude of AA-induced [Ca(2+)]i oscillations. In ASM cells derived from individuals with asthma, AA increased oscillation amplitude, but not frequency. These results are highly suggestive of a novel AA-mediated Ca(2+)-regulatory mechanism in human ASM, reminiscent of agonist-induced oscillations. Given the role of AA in ASM intracellular signaling, especially with inflammation, AA-regulated Ca(2+) channels could potentially contribute to increased [Ca(2+)]i in diseases such asthma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698a","authors":["Thompson MA","Prakash YS","Pabelick CM"],"doi":"10.1165\/rcmb.2013-0144oc","first_seen_on":"2014-09-12T11:14:26+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1044-1549"],"issue":"","journal":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1410520419,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24471656?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24471656","pubdate":"2014-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Arachidonate-Regulated Ca<sup>2+<\/sup> Influx in Human Airway Smooth Muscle.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arachidonateregulated-ca2-influx-human-airway-smooth-muscle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7394895,"mean":6.4269943728701,"rank":5594040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7394895,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185108,"mean":7.6197162397967,"rank":120173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185108,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1006,"mean":2.6694786069652,"rank":805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1006,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2.9562926829268,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/status\/510385748659290112","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2678368],"posted_on":"2014-09-12T11:13:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
