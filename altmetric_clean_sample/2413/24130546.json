Support for caregivers is urgently needed, and for this reason, a dementia simulator (Into D'mentia) was developed in which caregivers experience what it is like to have dementia. The simulator attempts to heighten caregivers' empathy and understanding for the patient and, in turn, diminish their own caregiver burden. The current study evaluates whether the simulator is effective on a number of outcomes.\nA longitudinal, quasi-experimental study is ongoing in the Netherlands. We aim to recruit 142 caregivers in total divided over two groups: 71 caregivers in the intervention group and 71 caregivers in the control group. All participants will complete interviews and questionnaires at four time points: at baseline, 1\u2009week, 2.5 months and 15 months after the training. The primary outcomes include empathy, caregiver burden, caregiver's sense of competence, social reliance, anxiety, depression and caregivers' subjective and objective health.\nThis study is being carried out in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol has been approved by the local ethics committees.\nThis study is registered with The Netherlands National Trial Register (NNTR5856).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Linda Helena J\u00fctten","Ruth Elaine Mark","Ben Wilhelmus Jacobus Maria Janssen","Jan Rietsema","Rose-Marie Dr\u00f6es","Margriet Maria Sitskoorn"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-015702","first_seen_on":"2017-08-21T08:45:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"8","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1503305115,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/8\/e015702?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/7\/8\/e015702.full.pdf","pmid":"28827242","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e015702","title":"Testing the effectivity of the mixed virtual reality training Into D\u2019mentia for informal caregivers of people with dementia: protocol for a longitudinal, quasi-experimental study","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/testing-effectivity-mixed-virtual-reality-training-dmentia-informal-caregivers-people-dementia-proto"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7267960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167551,"mean":12.662102727544,"rank":137324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167551,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6254,"mean":17.207580361427,"rank":5756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6254,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300,"mean":10.232775919732,"rank":252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":5}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/899552969552777216","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24130546],"posted_on":"2017-08-21T08:45:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":980},"tweet_id":"899552969552777216"}]}}
