To describe and compare EEG and clinical epileptic manifestations frequency in patients with an anterior circulation ischaemic stroke. Prospective study of acute anterior circulation ischaemic stroke patients, consecutively admitted to a Stroke Unit over 24\u00a0months and followed-up for 1 year. All patients underwent standardized clinical and diagnostic assessment. Seizure occurrence was clinically evaluated during hospitalization and by a telephone interview at 6\u00a0months and a clinical appointment at 12\u00a0months after stroke. Video-EEG was performed in the first 72\u00a0h (1st EEG), daily after the 1st EEG for the first 7\u00a0days after the stroke, or later if neurological worsening, at discharge, and at 12\u00a0months. 151 patients were included (112 men) with a mean age of 67.4 (11.9) years. In the 1st year after stroke, 38 patients (25.2%) had an epileptic seizure. During hospitalization, 27 patients (17.9%) had epileptiform activity (interictal or ictal) in the EEG, 7 (25.9%) of them electrographic seizures. During the first week after stroke, 22 (14.6%) patients had a seizure and 4 (2.6%) non-convulsive status epilepticus criteria. Five (22.7%) acute symptomatic seizures were exclusively electrographic. At least one remote symptomatic seizure occurred in 23 (16%) patients. In the first 7\u00a0days after stroke, more than one-fifth of patients with seizures had exclusively electrographic seizures. Without a systematic neurophysiological evaluation the frequency of post-stroke seizures are clinically underestimated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e77","authors":["Carla Bentes","Hugo Martins","Ana Rita Peralta","Carlos Casimiro","Carlos Morgado","Ana Catarina Franco","Ana Catarina Fonseca","Ruth Geraldes","Patr\u00edcia Canh\u00e3o","Teresa Pinho e Melo","Teresa Paiva","Jos\u00e9 M.
