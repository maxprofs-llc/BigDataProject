Likewise, a 1 SD higher fiber intake (10 g) was significantly associated both with a lower systolic (-2.20 mmHg) and with a lower diastolic (-2.08 mmHg) blood pressure.\nDiets higher in protein and fiber content are associated with a lower blood pressure in the present population sample. The present results indicate that dietary intake of macronutrients might be important in the development and prevention of high blood pressure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a49","authors":["He, J","Klag, M J","Whelton, P K","Chen, J Y","Qian, M C","He, G Q"],"first_seen_on":"2016-11-13T12:05:32+00:00","issns":["0263-6352"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Hypertension","last_mentioned_on":1501484400,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8984124"],"pmid":"8984124","pubdate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Dietary macronutrients and blood pressure in southwestern China.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dietary-macronutrients-blood-pressure-southwestern-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16,"score_history":{"1y":16,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":536088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7761304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238049,"mean":13.084239111439,"rank":26849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":211106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238049,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2705,"mean":2.5719356508876,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":2646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2705,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":4.0994594594595,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
