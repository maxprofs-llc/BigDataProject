Computed tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of brain\/orbit showed a fusiform enlargement of the left optic nerve and total filling of vitreous cavity by a mass with high signal intensity in T2-weighted MRI. There was no extension into the intracranial cavity. The patient also had no signs of neurofibromatosis. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of ONG of the left orbit with extension into the globe and filling vitreous cavity.\nONG may extend to the vitreous cavity with no simultaneous intracranial involvement.","altmetric_jid":"567962162a83ee58358b457c","authors":["Eghtedari, Masoomeh","Fattahi, Seyede Fariba","Owji, Naser","Ashraf, Mohammad Javad","Khalili, Mohammad Reza","Geramizadeh, Bita"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.joco.2016.07.001","endpage":"231","first_seen_on":"2016-11-13T09:48:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2452-2325","24522325"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Current Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1478559831,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S245223251630052X"],"pmcid":"PMC5093854","pmid":"27830210","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"228","title":"Optic nerve glioma with complete intraocular extension","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optic-nerve-glioma-complete-intraocular-extension"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7659635,"mean":6.5812991774756,"rank":6628163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7659635,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228403,"mean":12.89447135314,"rank":184465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228403,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.69583333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Optic nerve glioma with complete intraocular extension","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1018330648293593&id=875216145938378","license":"public","citation_ids":[13561055],"posted_on":"2016-11-07T23:03:51+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S245223251630052X","author":{"name":"Oculoplastic Surgery Journal Club","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/875216145938378","facebook_wall_name":"Oculoplastic Surgery Journal Club","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/875216145938378\/picture","id_on_source":"875216145938378"}}]}}
