We present a 14-year-old boy with ASD and self-injurious behavior (SIB) refractory with medical and behavioral therapy. He was treated by bilateral nucleus accumbens (NAc) DBS. Remarkable clinical improvement was observed following NAc DBS. Brain fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric studies revealed that the metabolism in the prefrontal and the frontal cortex as well as the occipital cortex was markedly decreased in association with the decreased cortical volumes in those areas 2\u00a0years after NAc DBS. The therapeutic potential of NAc DBS is suggested for the clinical improvement of patients with ASD and SIB with structural and functional changes after DBS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002157","authors":["Hye Ran Park","In Hyang Kim","Hyejin Kang","Dong Soo Lee","Bung-Nyun Kim","Dong Gyu Kim","Sun Ha Paek"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00701-016-3002-2","first_seen_on":"2016-11-13T16:15:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0942-0940"],"journal":"Acta Neurochirurgica","last_mentioned_on":1492432777,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00701-016-3002-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00701-016-3002-2.pdf","pmid":"27807672","pubdate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Vienna","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Interventional Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Minimally Invasive Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neuroradiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Nucleus accumbens deep brain stimulation for a patient with self-injurious behavior and autism spectrum disorder: functional and structural changes of the brain: report of a case and review of literature","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nucleus-accumbens-deep-brain-stimulation-patient-selfinjurious-behavior-autism-spectrum-disorder-fun-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078137,"mean":6.8589454589436,"rank":3474286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4489408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078137,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233943,"mean":13.098518889297,"rank":99394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":130902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233943,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":547,"mean":3.1372527472527,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":547,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":3.432,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ELHELOUA\/statuses\/797835254530797572","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13568747],"posted_on":"2016-11-13T16:15:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Antonios El Helou","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868277580767662080\/rFGISeZq_normal.jpg","description":"Neurosurgeon.\nGeneral Neurosurgery, Neuro-oncology, and Functional Neurosurgery. \nMovement disorders, Epilepsy and pain","id_on_source":"ELHELOUA","tweeter_id":"921851845","geo":{"lt":46.11594,"ln":-64.80186,"country":"CA"},"followers":100},"tweet_id":"797835254530797572"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/linda_hazlett\/statuses\/853951076986478592","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13568747],"posted_on":"2017-04-17T12:39:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Linda Hazlett","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/694304801568473088\/eZb1OG4y_normal.jpg","description":"I like to share top news stories on science, medical research, politics and business...I am retired, an artist, I live in New Brunswick Canada.","id_on_source":"linda_hazlett","tweeter_id":"3912681141","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":66},"tweet_id":"853951076986478592"}]}}
