At the time of the analysis, 30 of the 35 countries of the Americas are Parties to the FCTC. While progress has been made in implementing the measures contained in the FCTC, the level of implementation has not been homogeneous either across mandates or across countries. Forty percent of Parties to the Convention in the Americas are yet to implement any of the measures at their highest level of implementation according to the WHO classification. It is crucial that the countries of the Americas continue to progress towards the full implementation of the FCTC progressively. In these efforts, it is important to take into account that FCTC measures such as those related to smoke-free environments and adoption of effective health warnings are basic public health measures, which are almost entirely within the competence of health authorities and therefore susceptible to be implemented in a prompt fashion in all countries of the region.","altmetric_jid":"56a768dd2a83eeb12a8b4632","authors":["Blanco, Adriana","Sandoval, Rosa Carolina","Mart\u00ednez-L\u00f3pez, Leticia","Caixeta, Roberta de Bet\u00e2nia","Blanco, Adriana","Sandoval, Rosa Carolina","Mart\u00ednez-L\u00f3pez, Leticia","Caixeta, Roberta de Bet\u00e2nia"],"doi":"10.21149\/8682","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T21:11:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00363634","0036-3634"],"issue":"Suppl 1","journal":"Salud P\u00fablica de M\u00e9xico","last_mentioned_on":1500585092,"links":["http:\/\/www.scielosp.org\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0036-36342017000700117#.WXEcZR0RY-8.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scielosp.org\/pdf\/spm\/v59s1\/0036-3634-spm-59-s1-00117.pdf","pmid":"28658460","publisher":"Instituto Nacional de Salud P\u00fablica","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Diez a\u00f1os del Convenio Marco de la OMS para el Control del Tabaco: avances en las Am\u00e9ricas","type":"article","volume":"59Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ten-years-framework-convention-tobacco-control-progress-americas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8248040,"mean":6.9694059574582,"rank":4383762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2295797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8248040,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168679,"mean":11.698555093136,"rank":91861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":60167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168679,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":1.8414383561644,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AtaexSiberia\/statuses\/888144366665125888","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22240592],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T21:11:32+00:00","author":{"name":"ATAEX siberia","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/862718742303825922\/njp5B60p_normal.jpg","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n de Afectados por Tabaquismo en Extremadura","id_on_source":"AtaexSiberia","tweeter_id":"862717521350324224","geo":{"lt":39,"ln":-6,"country":"ES"},"followers":44},"tweet_id":"888144366665125888"}]}}
