We compared the degree of conjunctivitis induced by CAC before and after ingesting mandarin orange yogurt for 2 weeks. Experiment 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed on 31 patients (age, 32.5 \u00b1 12.2 years). A diet containing mandarin orange yogurt was compared to a diet containing yogurt lacking the mandarin orange on the conjunctivitis induced by CAC. The temperature of the inferior bulbar conjunctiva was measured before and 20 minutes after the CAC with an ocular surface thermographer (OST). The degree of conjunctival injection and chemosis was graded by slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The changes in the symptoms were evaluated by a questionnaire.\nIn experiment 1, the scores of redness (3.07 \u00b1 3.03 vs. 1.05 \u00b1 1.70), chemosis (2.84 \u00b1 2.27 vs. 0.81 \u00b1 1.11), itching (4.34 \u00b1 3.05 vs. 1.39 \u00b1 2.12), and temperature (0.73 \u00b1 0.42\u00b0C vs. 0.45 \u00b1 0.43\u00b0C) were significantly lower (P < 0.001) after a diet of mandarin orange yogurt for 2 weeks. In experiment 2, the scores of redness (1.03 \u00b1 0.18 vs. 1.28 \u00b1 0.52; P = 0.0156), itching (1.93 \u00b1 1.92 vs. 2.82 \u00b1 2.21; P = 0.0133), and surface temperature (0.54 \u00b1 0.21\u00b0C vs. 0.31 \u00b1 0.25\u00b0C; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the mandarin orange yogurt group than in the control yogurt group.\nMandarin orange yogurt can be an effective nutritional intervention for allergic conjunctivitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a79","authors":["Yuko Hara","Atsushi Shiraishi","Yuri Sakane","Yuki Takezawa","Tomoyuki Kamao","Yuichi Ohashi","Sho Yasunaga","Takuya Sugahara"],"doi":"10.1167\/iovs.16-21206","first_seen_on":"2017-07-21T00:40:20+00:00","issns":["1552-5783"],"issue":"7","journal":"Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science","last_mentioned_on":1500597607,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28593244?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28593244","pubdate":"2017-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Effect of Mandarin Orange Yogurt on Allergic Conjunctivitis Induced by Conjunctival Allergen Challenge","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-mandarin-orange-yogurt-allergic-conjunctivitis-induced-conjunctival-allergen-challenge"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":7136021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167704,"mean":11.662598570091,"rank":136803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167704,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2835,"mean":3.3839541284404,"rank":2071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2835,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":10.612913043478,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/plant_biology\/statuses\/888196857691725826","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22242678],"posted_on":"2017-07-21T00:40:07+00:00","author":{"name":"plantbio","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"plant_biology","tweeter_id":"3182517054","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":106},"tweet_id":"888196857691725826"}]}}
