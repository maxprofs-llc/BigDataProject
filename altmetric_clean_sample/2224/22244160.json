In this study, we used partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate analytic technique, to investigate the neural networks used by dyslexics while performing a word-rhyming task. Although the overall reading network was largely similar in dyslexics and typical readers, it did not correlate with behavior in the same way in the two groups. In particular, there was a positive association between reading performance and both right superior temporal gyrus and bilateral insula activation in dyslexic readers but a negative correlation in typical readers. Together with differences in lateralization unique to dyslexics, this suggests that the combination of poor reading performance with high insula activity and atypical laterality is a consistent marker of dyslexia. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding right-hemisphere activation in dyslexia and provide promising directions for the remediation of reading disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002426","authors":["Waldie, Karen E.","Wilson, Anna J.","Roberts, Reece P.","Moreau, David"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bandl.2017.07.004","first_seen_on":"2017-07-21T03:08:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0093-934X","0093934X"],"journal":"Brain & Language","last_mentioned_on":1500842765,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0093934X16302176"],"pmid":"28715717","pubdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","speechlanguagepathology","brain"],"title":"Reading network in dyslexia: Similar, yet different","type":"article","volume":"174","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reading-network-dyslexia-similar-different"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":2,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261251,"mean":6.9754429808982,"rank":3574546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4568979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261251,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173133,"mean":11.662962028972,"rank":68288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":101868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173133,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":613,"mean":6.9715947712418,"rank":357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":613,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.66,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
