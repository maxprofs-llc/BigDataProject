In an effort to reduce the scheduling complexity and extend the battery lifetime of the sensor nodes, the switch-and-stay combining (SSC) scheduling scheme is exploited over the sensor nodes. Meanwhile, transmit antenna selection (TAS) is employed at the BS and cooperative jamming (CJ) is adopted at the jammer node, aiming at achieving a satisfactory secrecy performance. Moreover, depending on whether the jammer node has the global channel state information (CSI) of both the legitimate channel and the eavesdropper's channel, it explores a zero-forcing beamforming (ZFB) scheme or a null-space artificial noise (NAN) scheme to confound the eavesdropper while avoiding the interference to the legitimate user. Building on this, we propose two novel hybrid secure transmission schemes, termed TAS-SSC-ZFB and TAS-SSC-NAN, for WSNs. We then derive the exact closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability and the effective secrecy throughput of both schemes to characterize the secrecy performance. Using these closed-form expressions, we further determine the optimal switching threshold and obtain the optimal power allocation factor between the BS and jammer node for both schemes to minimize the secrecy outage probability, while the optimal secrecy rate is decided to maximize the effective secrecy throughput for both schemes. Numerical results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis and illustrate the impact of key system parameters on the secrecy performance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Maoqiang Yang"],"doi":"10.3390\/s16111908","first_seen_on":"2016-11-12T10:27:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"11","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1478946419,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/11\/1908?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/11\/1908\/pdf","pmid":"27845753","pubdate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Secure Multiuser Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks with TAS and Cooperative Jamming","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/secure-multiuser-communications-wireless-sensor-networks-tas-cooperative-jamming"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":5811559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1035987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229729,"mean":12.96794117391,"rank":158069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":43770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229729,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3111,"mean":1.762898392283,"rank":1569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3111,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":470,"mean":1.3920042643923,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":470,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
