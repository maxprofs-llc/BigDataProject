We present evidence of analogous molecules for copper transport from methane-oxidizing bacteria, represented here by a small fluorescent chromopeptide (C45N12O14H62Cu, 1216 daltons) produced by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. The crystal structure of this compound, methanobactin, was resolved to 1.15 angstroms. It is composed of a tetrapeptide, a tripeptide, and several unusual moieties, including two 4-thionyl-5-hydroxy-imidazole chromophores that coordinate the copper, a pyrrolidine that confers a bend in the overall chain, and an amino-terminal isopropylester group. The copper coordination environment includes a dual nitrogen- and sulfur-donating system derived from the thionyl imidazolate moieties. Structural elucidation of this molecule has broad implications in terms of organo-copper chemistry, biological methane oxidation, and global carbon cycling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2004Sci...305.1612K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Kim, Hyung J","Graham, David W","DiSpirito, Alan A","Alterman, Michail A","Galeva, Nadezhda","Larive, Cynthia K","Asunskis, Dan","Sherwood, Peter M A"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1098322","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1095-9203"],"issue":"5690","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1098662400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15361623"],"pmid":"15361623","pubdate":"2004-09-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AAAS","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Methanobactin, a copper-acquisition compound from methane-oxidizing bacteria.","type":"article","volume":"305","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methanobactin-copperacquisition-compound-methaneoxidizing-bacteria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":2015485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2728279,"mean":5.216000113629,"rank":1475925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":746580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2728279,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27896,"mean":20.990664778634,"rank":22407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":3188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27896,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23302,"mean":24.102617999228,"rank":18217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":2799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23302,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Ph.
