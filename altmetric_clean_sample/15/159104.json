In this paper, we have utilized the combination of strong cation exchange (SCX) and reversed-phase (RP) chromatography to achieve two-dimensional separation prior to MS\/MS. One milligram of whole yeast protein was proteolyzed and separated by SCX chromatography (2.1 mm i.d.) with fraction collection every minute during an 80-min elution. Eighty fractions were reduced in volume and then re-injected via an autosampler in an automated fashion using a vented-column (100 microm i.d.) approach for RP-LC-MS\/MS analysis. More than 162,000 MS\/MS spectra were collected with 26,815 matched to yeast peptides (7,537 unique peptides). A total of 1,504 yeast proteins were unambiguously identified in this single analysis. We present a comparison of this experiment with a previously published yeast proteome analysis by Yates and colleagues (Washburn, M. P.; Wolters, D.; Yates, J. R., III. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001, 19, 242-7). In addition, we report an in-depth analysis of the false-positive rates associated with peptide identification using the Sequest algorithm and a reversed yeast protein database. New criteria are proposed to decrease false-positives to less than 1% and to greatly reduce the need for manual interpretation while permitting more proteins to be identified.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e0f","authors":["Peng, Junmin","Elias, Joshua E","Thoreen, Carson C","Licklider, Larry J","Gygi, Steven P"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1535-3893"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","last_mentioned_on":1337891410,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12643542"],"pmid":"12643542","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"ACS Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Evaluation of multidimensional chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/LC-MS\/MS) for large-scale protein analysis: the yeast proteome.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-multidimensional-chromatography-coupled-tandem-mass-spectrometry-lclcmsms-largescale-prot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3837088,"mean":5.0354099435381,"rank":881120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2425250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3837088,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2889926,"mean":5.4997700867713,"rank":720064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1810725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2889926,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1840,"mean":2.6456498096792,"rank":261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":1468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1840,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1784,"mean":2.6024453168817,"rank":250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":1426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1784,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":21,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":49,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
