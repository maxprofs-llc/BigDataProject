One group of crickets was trained to associate one of a pair of odors (conditioned stimulus, CS1) with water reward (appetitive unconditioned stimulus, US+) and another odor (CS2) with saline solution (aversive US, US-) under illumination and to associate CS1 with US- and CS2 with US+ in the dark. Another group of crickets received training of the opposite stimulus arrangement. At 1 d after the training for 3 d, the former group significantly preferred CS1 over CS2 under illumination but preferred CS2 over CS1 in the dark, and the latter group exhibited the opposite odor preference. The results of control experiments showed that the background light condition had no significant effects on memory formation or retrieval unless it was explicitly associated with US during training. Thus, the visual context affected learning performance only when crickets were requested to use it to disambiguate the meaning of CSs and to predict USs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610008013","doi":"10.1101\/lm.72504","issns":["1072-0502"],"issue":"3","journal":"Learning & Memory","last_mentioned_on":1113523200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15169858"],"pmid":"15169858","pubdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Context-dependent olfactory learning in an insect.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contextdependent-olfactory-learning-insect"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629407,"mean":4.9349111287126,"rank":2016202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":939485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629407,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727362,"mean":5.2214628008575,"rank":1476446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":744105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727362,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316,"mean":4.3609587301587,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":3.5836962025316,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
