In this study, we examined the functional role of the Runx1 transcription factor in Th cell differentiation. Naive T cells from transgenic mice expressing a dominant interfering form of Runx1 exhibited enhanced interleukin 4 production and efficient Th2 differentiation. In contrast, transduction of Runx1 into wild-type T cells caused a complete attenuation of Th2 differentiation and was accompanied by the cessation of GATA3 expression. Furthermore, endogenous expression of Runx1 in naive T cells declined after T cell receptor stimulation, at the same time that expression of GATA3 increased. We conclude that Runx1 plays a novel role as a negative regulator of GATA3 expression, thereby inhibiting the Th2 cell differentiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Komine, Okiru","Hayashi, Keitaro","Natsume, Waka","Watanabe, Toshio","Seki, Youichi","Seki, Noriyasu","Yagi, Ryoji","Sukzuki, Wataru","Tamauchi, Hidekazu","Hozumi, Katsuto","Habu, Sonoko","Kubo, Masato","Satake, Masanobu"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.20021200","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-1007"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1061164800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12835475"],"pmcid":"PMC2196077","pmid":"12835475","pubdate":"2003-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Rockefeller University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The Runx1 transcription factor inhibits the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into the Th2 lineage by repressing GATA3 expression.","type":"article","volume":"198","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/runx1-transcription-factor-inhibits-differentiation-naive-cd4-b-supsup-b-t-cells-th2-lineage-repress"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":2018504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2725045,"mean":5.2330762064783,"rank":1477809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2725045,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2717,"mean":3.4154882179676,"rank":1420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2717,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1870,"mean":2.8709823434992,"rank":677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1870,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/1014358","license":"public","citation_ids":[157646],"posted_on":"2003-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["new_finding"],"f1000_score":"1"}]}}
