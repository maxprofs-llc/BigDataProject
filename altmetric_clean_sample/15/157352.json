Here we describe measurements of mechanoelectrical transducer currents in outer hair cells of rats between postnatal days 5 and 18, before and after the onset of hearing. Deflection of hair bundles using a new rapid piezoelectric stimulator evoked transducer currents with ultra-fast activation and adaptation kinetics. Fast adaptation resembled the same process in turtle hair cells, where it is regulated by changes in stereociliary calcium. It is argued that sub-millisecond transducer adaptation can operate in outer hair cells under the ionic, driving force and temperature conditions that prevail in the intact mammalian cochlea.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","authors":["Kennedy, Helen J","Evans, Michael G","Crawford, Andrew C","Fettiplace, Robert","Helen J Kennedy","Michael G Evans","Andrew C Crawford","Robert Fettiplace"],"doi":"10.1038\/nn1089","endpage":"836","issns":["1097-6256","10976256"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nature Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1064361600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12872124"],"pmid":"12872124","pubdate":"2003-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"832","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Fast adaptation of mechanoelectrical transducer channels in mammalian cochlear hair cells.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nn1089","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fast-adaptation-mechanoelectrical-transducer-channels-mammalian-cochlear-hair-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681522,"mean":5.6990934027662,"rank":2490786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1553235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681522,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3602959,"mean":6.4673767904059,"rank":1990156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1108494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3602959,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2935,"mean":22.584417177914,"rank":2177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2935,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2918,"mean":22.442052793966,"rank":2161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2918,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
