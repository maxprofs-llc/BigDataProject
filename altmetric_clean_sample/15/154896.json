Trajectories constructed from cortical activity recorded in monkeys performing the same task showed that the actual movement was represented in the primary motor cortex, whereas the visualized, presumably perceived, trajectories were found in the ventral premotor cortex. Perception and action representations can be differentially recognized in the brain and may be contained in separate structures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2004Sci...303..380S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","doi":"10.1126\/science.1087788","issns":["1095-9203"],"issue":"5656","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1080086400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14726593"],"pmid":"14726593","pubdate":"2004-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AAAS","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Differential representation of perception and action in the frontal cortex.","type":"article","volume":"303","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-representation-perception-action-frontal-cortex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632408,"mean":4.9240837059336,"rank":2015259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632408,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2729139,"mean":5.2122699350529,"rank":1475539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":748562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2729139,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27896,"mean":20.962485893529,"rank":22401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":3205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27896,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23303,"mean":24.080197407948,"rank":18213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":2814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23303,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":23,"Researcher":63,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
