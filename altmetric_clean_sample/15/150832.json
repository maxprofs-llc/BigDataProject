In Drosophila, this is often compensated for by extraproliferation of neighboring cells, which allows the organism to tolerate considerable cell death without compromising development and body size. Despite its importance, the mechanistic basis of such compensatory proliferation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that apoptotic cells express the secretory factors wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp). When cells undergoing apoptosis were kept alive with the caspase inhibitor p35, excessive nonautonomous cell proliferation was observed. Significantly, wg signaling is necessary and, at least in some cells, also sufficient for mitogenesis under these conditions. Finally, we provide evidence that the DIAP1 antagonists reaper and hid can activate the JNK pathway and that this pathway is required for inducing wg and cell proliferation. These findings support a model where apoptotic cells activate signaling cascades for compensatory proliferation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f0","doi":"10.1016\/j.devcel.2004.08.019","issns":["1534-5807"],"issue":"4","journal":"Developmental Cell","last_mentioned_on":1101686400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15469838"],"pmid":"15469838","pubdate":"2004-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","cellbiology"],"title":"Apoptotic cells can induce compensatory cell proliferation through the JNK and the Wingless signaling pathways.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apoptotic-cells-induce-compensatory-cell-proliferation-through-jnk-wingless-signaling-pathways"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629479,"mean":4.9344089205159,"rank":2016192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":939517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629479,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727373,"mean":5.2214618321261,"rank":1476435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":744130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727373,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1642,"mean":4.2227921998781,"rank":827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1642,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1395,"mean":3.4483543758967,"rank":618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1395,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Researcher":37,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
