In this study, DNA microarrays were used to study the genetic basis of this natural furanone inhibition of AI-2 signaling (significant values with p < 0.05 are reported). Using DNA microarrays, the AI-2 mutant Escherichia coli DH5alpha was compared with the AI-2 wild-type strain, E. coli K12, to determine how AI-2 influenced gene expression. Escherichia coli K12 was also grown with 0 and 60 microg\/mL furanone to study the inhibition of quorum sensing gene expression. It was found that 166 genes were differentially expressed by AI-2 (67 were induced and 99 were repressed) and 90 genes were differentially expressed by furanone (34 were induced and 56 were repressed). Importantly, 79% (44 out of 56) of the genes repressed by furanone were induced by AI-2, which indicated that furanone inhibited AI-2 signaling and influenced the same suite of genes as a regulon. Most of these genes have functions of chemotaxis, motility, and flagellar synthesis. Interestingly, the aerotaxis genes aer and tsr were discovered to be induced by AI-2 and repressed by furanone. Representative microarray results were confirmed by RNA dot blotting. Furthermore, the E. coli air-liquid interface biofilm formation was repressed by furanone, supporting the results that taxis and flagellar genes were repressed by furanone. The autoinducer bioassay indicated that 100 microg\/mL furanone decreased the extracellular concentration of AI-2 2-fold, yet luxS and pfs transcription were not significantly altered. Hence, furanone appeared to alter AI-2 signaling post-transcriptionally.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006ca1","doi":"10.1002\/bit.20259","issns":["0006-3592"],"issue":"5","journal":"Biotechnology & Bioengineering","last_mentioned_on":1103068800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15470704"],"pmid":"15470704","pubdate":"2004-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley \\& Sons","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","biotechnology"],"title":"Differential gene expression shows natural brominated furanones interfere with the autoinducer-2 bacterial signaling system of Escherichia coli.","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-gene-expression-shows-natural-brominated-furanones-interfere-autoinducer2-bacterial-sig"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628259,"mean":4.9430875566221,"rank":2017516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628259,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726501,"mean":5.229226274714,"rank":1477478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":740745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726501,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":641,"mean":1.97986875,"rank":247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":641,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":469,"mean":1.9823888888889,"rank":172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":469,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
