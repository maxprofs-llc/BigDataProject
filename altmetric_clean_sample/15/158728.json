ZmSAUR2 encodes a 15.3-kDa protein and is specifically induced by auxin in elongating coleoptile tissue but not in primary leaves or in roots. The transcript level rapidly increased within minutes and preceded auxin-stimulated elongation of coleoptile segments. Cycloheximide also induced ZmSAUR2 transcription, as has been shown for other early auxin-induced genes, whereas abscisic acid, brassinolide, ethylene, gibberellic acid, kinetin, and methyl jasmonate did not provoke an increase in ZmSAUR2 mRNA abundance. In pulse-chase experiments using auxin-induced coleoptiles and an anti-ZmSAUR2 antibody we were able to precipitate a protein of the expected molecular mass and to determine a half-life of about 7 min, which is among the shortest known in eukaryotes. In gel shift assays binding of calmodulin to ZmSAUR2 was demonstrated, suggesting the possibility of post-transcriptional regulation. Upon transformation of onion epidermal cells with a ZmSAUR2::GUS construct the corresponding chimeric protein was detected in the nucleus. The results suggest that ZmSAUR2 encodes a short-lived nuclear protein that might be involved in auxin-mediated cell elongation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Knauss, Stefan","Rohrmeier, Thomas","Lehle, Ludwig"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m212585200","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"26","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1051660800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12695517"],"pmid":"12695517","pubdate":"2003-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The auxin-induced maize gene ZmSAUR2 encodes a short-lived nuclear protein expressed in elongating tissues.","type":"article","volume":"278","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/auxininduced-maize-gene-zmsaur2-encodes-shortlived-nuclear-protein-expressed-elongating-tissues"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627884,"mean":4.9451200333677,"rank":2017827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627884,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726216,"mean":5.2305239836209,"rank":1477693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":739884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726216,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6453097963696,"rank":19801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14796,"mean":2.5154821223386,"rank":8424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":2575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14796,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
