Two highly homologous polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV, which belong to the sialyltransferase gene family, synthesize polysialic acid on NCAM. By contrast, ST8Sia III, which is moderately homologous to ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV, adds oligosialic acid to itself but very inefficiently to NCAM. Here, we report domains of polysialyltransferases required for NCAM recognition and polysialylation by generating chimeric enzymes between ST8Sia IV and ST8Sia III or ST8Sia II. We first determined the catalytic domain of ST8Sia IV by deletion mutants. To identify domains responsible for NCAM polysialylation, different segments of the ST8Sia IV catalytic domain, identified by the deletion experiments, were replaced with corresponding segments of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia III. We found that larger polysialic acid was formed on the enzymes themselves (autopolysialylation) when chimeric enzymes contained the carboxyl-terminal region of ST8Sia IV. However, chimeric enzymes that contain only the carboxyl-terminal segment of ST8Sia IV and the amino-terminal segment of ST8Sia III showed very weak activity toward NCAM, even though they had strong activity in polysialylating themselves. In fact, chimeric enzymes containing the amino-terminal portion of ST8Sia IV fused to downstream sequences of ST8Sia III inhibited NCAM polysialylation in vitro, although they did not polysialylate NCAM. These results suggest that in polysialyltransferases the NCAM recognition domain is distinct from the polysialylation domain and that some chimeric enzymes may act as a dominant negative enzyme for NCAM polysialylation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m401562200","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"24","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1083024000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15067013"],"pmid":"15067013","pubdate":"2004-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Molecular dissection of the ST8Sia IV polysialyltransferase.
