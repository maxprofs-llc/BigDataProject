Aurora kinases are linked to oncogenesis and have been implicated in the regulation of chromosome-microtubule attachments. Although loss of Aurora kinase activity causes an accumulation of mal-orientated chromosomes in dividing cells, it is not known how the active kinase corrects improper chromosome attachments. The use of reversible small-molecule inhibitors allows activation of protein function in living vertebrate cells with temporal control. Here we show that by removal of small-molecule inhibitors, controlled activation of Aurora kinase during mitosis can correct chromosome attachment errors by selective disassembly of kinetochore-microtubule fibres, rather than by alternative mechanisms involving initial release of microtubules from either kinetochores or spindle poles. Observation of chromosomes and microtubule dynamics with real-time high-resolution microscopy showed that mal-orientated, but not bi-orientated, chromosomes move to the spindle pole as both kinetochore-microtubule fibres shorten, followed by alignment at the metaphase plate. Our results provide direct evidence for a mechanism required for the maintenance of genome integrity during cell division.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","doi":"10.1038\/ncb1102","issns":["1465-7392"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nature Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1078185600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14767480"],"pmid":"14767480","pubdate":"2004-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Correcting improper chromosome-spindle attachments during cell division.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correcting-improper-chromosomespindle-attachments-during-cell-division"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628758,"mean":4.9386506288559,"rank":2016556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":937880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628758,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727111,"mean":5.2246885398861,"rank":1476856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":742880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727111,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1989,"mean":5.6880040241449,"rank":1203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1989,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1984,"mean":5.6878063540091,"rank":1199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1984,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":43,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
