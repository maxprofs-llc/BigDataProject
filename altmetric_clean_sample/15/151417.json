Membranes of Francisella novicida (an environmental strain related to F. tularensis) contain enzymes that dephosphorylate lipid A and its precursors at the 1- and 4'-positions. We now report the cloning and characterization of a membrane-bound phosphatase of F. novicida that selectively dephosphorylates the 1-position. By transferring an F. novicida genomic DNA library into E. coli and selecting for low level polymyxin resistance, we isolated FnlpxE as the structural gene for the 1-phosphatase, an inner membrane enzyme of 239 amino acid residues. Expression of FnlpxE in a heptose-deficient mutant of E. coli caused massive accumulation of a previously uncharacterized LPS molecule, identified by mass spectrometry as 1-dephospho-Kdo2-lipid A. The predicted periplasmic orientation of the FnLpxE active site suggested that LPS export might be required for 1-dephosphorylation of lipid A. LPS and phospholipid export depend on the activity of MsbA, an essential inner membrane ABC transporter. Expression of FnlpxE in the msbA temperature-sensitive E. coli mutant WD2 resulted in 90% 1-dephosphorylation of lipid A at the permissive temperature (30 degrees C). However, the 1-phosphate group of newly synthesized lipid A was not cleaved at the nonpermissive temperature (44 degrees C). Our findings provide the first direct evidence that lipid A 1-dephosphorylation catalyzed by LpxE occurs on the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m409078200","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"47","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1097452800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15339914"],"pmid":"15339914","pubdate":"2004-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"MsbA transporter-dependent lipid A 1-dephosphorylation on the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane: topography of francisella novicida LpxE expressed in Escherichia coli.","type":"article","volume":"279","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/msba-transporterdependent-lipid-1dephosphorylation-periplasmic-surface-inner-membrane-topography-fra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":2017242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":936101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726652,"mean":5.2273882554122,"rank":1477281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":741383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726652,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6440892264898,"rank":19793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14798,"mean":2.5146879772927,"rank":8424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":2579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14798,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
