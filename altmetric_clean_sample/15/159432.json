Dynamic spatiotemporal coordination is a vital, but poorly understood aspect, of these checkpoints. Here, we provide evidence for a strikingly different behaviour of Chk2 versus Nbs1, key mediators of the ataxia-telangiecatesia-mutated (ATM)-controlled checkpoint pathways induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In live human cells with DSBs restricted to small sub-nuclear areas, Nbs1 was rapidly recruited to the damaged regions and underwent a dynamic exchange in the close vicinity of the DSB sites. In contrast, Chk2 continued to rapidly move throughout the entire nucleus, irrespective of DNA damage and including the DSB-free areas. Although phosphorylation of Chk2 by ATM occurred exclusively at the DSB sites, forced immobilization of Chk2 to spatially restricted, DSB-containing nuclear areas impaired its stimulating effect on p53-dependent transcription. These results unravel a dynamic nature of Nbs1 interaction with DSB lesions and identify Chk2 as a candidate transmitter of the checkpoint signal, allowing for a coordinated pan-nuclear response to focal DNA damage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","authors":["Lukas, Claudia","Falck, Jacob","Bartkova, Jirina","Bartek, Jiri","Lukas, Jiri"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncb945","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1465-7392"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nature Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1460985218,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12598907"],"pmid":"12598907","pubdate":"2003-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Distinct spatiotemporal dynamics of mammalian checkpoint regulators induced by DNA damage.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distinct-spatiotemporal-dynamics-mammalian-checkpoint-regulators-induced-dna-damage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":1566007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5948059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6948492,"mean":6.8481615449994,"rank":1492457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5406257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6948492,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2381,"mean":9.9767462184874,"rank":866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2381,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2376,"mean":9.9925709473684,"rank":864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":1378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2376,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":43,"Student  > Ph.
