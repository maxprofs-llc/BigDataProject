However, much of the experimental evidence supporting this view was obtained in the visual cortex. We have, therefore, assessed trial-to-trial variability in the auditory cortex of the rat. To ensure single-unit isolation, we used cell-attached recording. Tone-evoked responses were usually transient, often consisting of, on average, only a single spike per stimulus. Surprisingly, the majority of responses were not just transient, but were also binary, consisting of 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response to each stimulus; several dramatic examples consisted of exactly one spike on 100% of trials, with no trial-to-trial variability in spike count. The variability of such binary responses differs from comparably transient responses recorded in visual cortical areas such as area MT, and represent the lowest trial-to-trial variability mathematically possible for responses of a given firing rate. Our study thus establishes for the first time that transient responses in auditory cortex can be described as a binary process, rather than as a highly variable Poisson process. These results demonstrate that cortical architecture can support a more precise control of spike number than was previously recognized, and they suggest a re-evaluation of models of cortical processing that assume noisiness to be an inevitable feature of cortical codes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["DeWeese, Michael R","Wehr, Michael","Zador, Anthony M"],"issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"21","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1461860110,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12944525","http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/23\/21\/7940.full.pdf+html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12944525"],"pmid":"12944525","pubdate":"2003-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Soc Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Binary Spiking in Auditory Cortex","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/binary-spiking-auditory-cortex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":5495387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1854864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7006559,"mean":6.876150458467,"rank":5067018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1685743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7006559,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12004,"mean":9.4219375156211,"rank":9994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12004,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11508,"mean":9.6878482662727,"rank":9535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":1737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11508,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":31,"Researcher":115,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
