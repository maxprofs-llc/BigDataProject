In this study, we show that the size and subunit composition of Pol I did not change significantly when Pol I was not engaged in rRNA transcription, brought about by either the absence of Pol I-specific rDNA template or specific inhibition of the transcription initiation step that requires Rrn3p. In fact, Pol I purified from cells completely lacking rDNA repeats was more active than when purified from wild-type cells in an in vitro transcription system designed to assay active Pol I-Rrn3p complexes. Furthermore, measurements of the exchange of A135 and A190 subunits between preexistent Pol I and newly synthesized Pol I showed that these two largest subunits of Pol I do not disassociate through many rounds of transcription in vivo. Thus, Pol I is not a dynamic protein complex but rather a stable enzyme.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2004PNAS..10115112S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Schneider, David A","Nomura, Masayasu"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0406746101","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"42","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1099958400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15477604"],"pmcid":"PMC524078","pmid":"15477604","pubdate":"2004-10-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"RNA polymerase I remains intact without subunit exchange through multiple rounds of transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rna-polymerase-i-remains-intact-without-subunit-exchange-through-multiple-rounds-transcription-sacch"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":2018664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2724892,"mean":5.2341621877743,"rank":1477920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2724892,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33571,"mean":13.677552219243,"rank":23250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33571,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26601,"mean":16.479432481203,"rank":17060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":3685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26601,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
