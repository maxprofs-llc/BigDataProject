In contrast to phage T7-RNAP, N4 RNAPII displays no activity on double-stranded templates and low activity on single-stranded templates. In vivo, at least one additional N4-coded protein (p17) is required for N4 middle transcription. We show that N4 ORF2 encodes p17 (gp2). Characterization of purified gp2revealed that it is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that activates N4 RNAPII transcription on single-stranded DNA templates through specific interaction with N4 RNAPII. On the basis of the properties of the proteins involved in N4 RNAPII transcription and of middle promoters, we propose a model for N4 RNAPII promoter recognition, in which gp2plays two roles, stabilization of a single-stranded region at the promoter and recruitment of N4 RNAPII through gp2-N4 RNAPII interactions. Furthermore, we discuss our results in the context of transcription initiation by mitochondrial RNA polymerases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["Carter, Richard H","Demidenko, Alexander A","Hattingh-Willis, Susan","Rothman-Denes, Lucia B"],"doi":"10.1101\/gad.1121403","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0890-9369"],"issue":"18","journal":"Genes & Development","last_mentioned_on":1063843200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12975320"],"pmcid":"PMC196469","pmid":"12975320","pubdate":"2003-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Phage N4 RNA polymerase II recruitment to DNA by a single-stranded DNA-binding protein.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phage-n4-rna-polymerase-ii-recruitment-dna-singlestranded-dnabinding-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":2015245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2729715,"mean":5.211570242161,"rank":1475558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":749353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2729715,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2543,"mean":3.0114185680566,"rank":1425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2543,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1723,"mean":2.8117909407666,"rank":721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1723,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
