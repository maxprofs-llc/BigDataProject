Consistent with exponential decrease in bond lifetime under rising force, this kinetically limited failure reflects dissociation along a single thermodynamic pathway impeded by a sharp free energy barrier. Using a sensitive force probe to test the leukocyte adhesion bond P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1)-P-selectin, we observed a linear increase of bond strength with each 10-fold increase in the rate of force application from 300 to 30,000 pN\/sec, implying a single pathway for failure. However, the strength and lifetime of PSGL-1-P-selectin bonds dropped anomalously when loaded below 300 pN\/sec, demonstrating unexpectedly faster dissociation and a possible second pathway for failure. Remarkably, if first loaded by a \"jump\" in force to 20-30 pN, the bonds became strong when subjected to a force ramp as slow as 30 pN\/sec and exhibited the same single-pathway kinetics under all force rates. Applied in this way, a new \"jump\/ramp\" mode of force spectroscopy was used to show that the PSGL-1-P-selectin bond behaves as a mechanochemical switch where force history selects between two dissociation pathways with markedly different properties. Furthermore, replacing PSGL-1 by variants of its 19-aa N terminus and by the crucial tetrasaccharide sialyl LewisX produces dramatic changes in the failure kinetics, suggesting a structural basis for the two pathways. The two-pathway switch seems to provide a mechanism for the \"catch bond\" response observed recently with PSGL-1-P-selectin bonds subjected to small-constant forces.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2004PNAS..10111281E","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0401870101","issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"31","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1257321137,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15277675","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC509195"],"pmid":"15277675","pubdate":"2004-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Mechanical switching and coupling between two dissociation pathways in a P-selectin adhesion bond","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanical-switching-coupling-between-two-dissociation-pathways-pselectin-adhesion-bond"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":680246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2929895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2730118,"mean":5.2109415010456,"rank":553742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2155284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2730118,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33627,"mean":13.597014809968,"rank":11454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":21445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33627,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26625,"mean":16.392645132212,"rank":11327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":14582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26625,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Ph.
