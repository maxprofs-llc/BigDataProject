Here we present a high-throughput genotyping platform that uses a one-primer assay to genotype over 10,000 SNPs per individual on a single oligonucleotide array. This approach uses restriction digestion to fractionate the genome, followed by amplification of a specific fractionated subset of the genome. The resulting reduction in genome complexity enables allele-specific hybridization to the array. The selection of SNPs was primarily determined by computer-predicted lengths of restriction fragments containing the SNPs, and was further driven by strict empirical measurements of accuracy, reproducibility, and average call rate, which we estimate to be >99.5%, >99.9%, and>95%, respectively [corrected]. With average heterozygosity of 0.38 and genome scan resolution of 0.31 cM, the SNP array is a viable alternative to panels of microsatellites (STRs). As a demonstration of the utility of the genotyping platform in whole-genome scans, we have replicated and refined a linkage region on chromosome 2p for chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and thyroid disease, previously identified using a panel of microsatellite (STR) markers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002944","doi":"10.1101\/gr.2014904","issns":["1088-9051"],"issue":"3","journal":"Genome Research","last_mentioned_on":1080691200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14993208"],"pmid":"14993208","pubdate":"2004-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Parallel genotyping of over 10,000 SNPs using a one-primer assay on a high-density oligonucleotide array.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parallel-genotyping-10000-snps-using-oneprimer-assay-highdensity-oligonucleotide-array"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9310300946799,"rank":2016353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":928649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2720145,"mean":5.1755415095841,"rank":1475273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":735263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2720145,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1800,"mean":8.6349594219011,"rank":1362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1800,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1345,"mean":8.4392931547619,"rank":944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1345,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":38,"Student  > Ph.
