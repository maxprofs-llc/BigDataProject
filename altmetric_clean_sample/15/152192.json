These data suggest that the pneumococcus has a major role in the development of pneumonia associated with these viruses and that viruses contribute to the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003166","authors":["Madhi, Shabir A","Klugman, Keith P",", "],"doi":"10.1038\/nm1077","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1078-8956"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nature Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1483228800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15247911"],"pmid":"15247911","pubdate":"2004-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","medicine"],"title":"A role for Streptococcus pneumoniae in virus-associated pneumonia.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-streptococcus-pneumoniae-virusassociated-pneumonia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":1112051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6781073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7329606,"mean":7.0482879677638,"rank":1070119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6193031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7329606,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4350,"mean":26.710353644516,"rank":1906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4350,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4348,"mean":26.731122613297,"rank":1905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4348,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
