Based on thermodynamic principles, proteins that bind to Ca(2+)-calmodulin should increase the affinity of calmodulin for Ca(2+), while proteins that bind to apo-calmodulin should decrease its affinity for Ca(2+). We quantified the effects on Ca(2+)-calmodulin interaction of two neuronal calmodulin targets: RC3, which binds both Ca(2+)- and apo-calmodulin, and alphaCaM kinase II, which binds selectively to Ca(2+)-calmodulin. RC3 was found to decrease the affinity of calmodulin for Ca(2+), whereas CaM kinase II increases the calmodulin affinity for Ca(2+). Specifically, RC3 increases the rate of Ca(2+) dissociation from the C-terminal sites of calmodulin up to 60-fold while having little effect on the rate of Ca(2+) association. Conversely, CaM kinase II decreases the rates of dissociation of Ca(2+) from both lobes of calmodulin and autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II at Thr(286) induces a further decrease in the rates of Ca(2+) dissociation. RC3 dampens the effects of CaM kinase II on Ca(2+) dissociation by increasing the rate of dissociation from the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin when in the presence of CaM kinase II. This effect is not seen with phosphorylated CaM kinase II. The results are interpreted according to a kinetic scheme in which there are competing pathways for dissociation of the Ca(2+)-calmodulin target complex. This work indicates that the Ca(2+) binding properties of calmodulin are highly regulated and reveals a role for RC3 in accelerating the dissociation of Ca(2+)-calmodulin target complexes at the end of a Ca(2+) signal.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m405352200","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"38","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1100822400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15262982"],"pmid":"15262982","pubdate":"2004-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"RC3\/Neurogranin and Ca2+\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II produce opposing effects on the affinity of calmodulin for calcium.","type":"article","volume":"279","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rc3neurogranin-ca2calmodulindependent-protein-kinase-ii-produce-opposing-effects-affinity-calmodulin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2018716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2724824,"mean":5.2343299186797,"rank":1477945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2724824,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28041,"mean":2.6476992867332,"rank":19819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28041,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14792,"mean":2.5188182002569,"rank":8434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":2554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14792,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
