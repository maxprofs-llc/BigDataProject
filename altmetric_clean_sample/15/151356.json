The phosphatidylserine receptor (Ptdsr) on phagocytes has been implicated in the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells and in anti-inflammatory signaling. To determine the biological function of the phosphatidylserine receptor in vivo, we inactivated the Ptdsr gene in the mouse.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b5","authors":["B\u00f6se J","Gruber AD","Helming L","Schiebe S","Wegener I","Hafner M","Beales M","K\u00f6ntgen F","Lengeling A","Jens B\u00f6se","Achim D Gruber","Laura Helming","Stefanie Schiebe","Ivonne Wegener","Martin Hafner","Marianne Beales","Frank K\u00f6ntgen","Andreas Lengeling"],"doi":"10.1186\/jbiol10","issns":["1475-4924","14754924"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Biology","last_mentioned_on":1198155814,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15345036","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC549712"],"pmid":"15345036","pubdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"15","subjects":["biology"],"title":"The phosphatidylserine receptor has essential functions during embryogenesis but not in apoptotic cell removal","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/jbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/jbiol10","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phosphatidylserine-receptor-essential-functions-during-embryogenesis-not-apoptotic-cell-removal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628758,"mean":4.9386506288559,"rank":680938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2924050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628758,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727098,"mean":5.2250013431898,"rank":554121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2151840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727098,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":5.7759718309859,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":6.07959375,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Ph.
