SVE is maintained by the subsequent rephosphorylation of the dephosphins by unidentified protein kinases. Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylates dynamin I on Ser 774 and Ser 778 in vitro, which are identical to its endogenous phosphorylation sites in vivo. Cdk5 antagonists and expression of dominant-negative Cdk5 block phosphorylation of dynamin I, but not of amphiphysin or AP180, in nerve terminals and inhibit SVE. Thus Cdk5 has an essential role in SVE and is the first dephosphin kinase identified in nerve terminals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","authors":["Tan, Timothy C","Valova, Valentina A","Malladi, Chandra S","Graham, Mark E","Berven, Leise A","Jupp, Orla J","Hansra, Gurdip","McClure, Sonya J","Sarcevic, Boris","Boadle, Ross A","Larsen, Martin R","Cousin, Michael A","Robinson, Phillip J"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncb1020","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1465-7392"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nature Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1070236800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12855954"],"pmid":"12855954","pubdate":"2003-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Cdk5 is essential for synaptic vesicle endocytosis.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cdk5-essential-synaptic-vesicle-endocytosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630112,"mean":4.9307700568987,"rank":2015689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630112,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727854,"mean":5.2178106855503,"rank":1476079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":745601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727854,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1989,"mean":5.6812837022133,"rank":1205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1989,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1984,"mean":5.6810852244075,"rank":1201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1984,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
