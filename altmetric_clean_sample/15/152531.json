Specific secretory organs, such as nectaries, hydathodes, and trichomes, use a combination of secretory and retrieval mechanisms, which are poorly understood at present. To study the mechanisms involved, an Arabidopsis thaliana activation tagged mutant, glutamine dumper1 (gdu1), was identified that accumulates salt crystals at the hydathodes. Chemical analysis demonstrated that, in contrast with the amino acid mixture normally present in guttation droplets, the crystals mainly contain Gln. GDU1 was cloned and found to encode a novel 17-kD protein containing a single putative transmembrane span. GDU1 is expressed in the vascular tissues and in hydathodes. Gln content is specifically increased in xylem sap and leaf apoplasm, whereas the content of several amino acids is increased in leaves and phloem sap. Selective secretion of Gln by the leaves may be explained by an enhanced release of this amino acid from cells. GDU1 study may help to shed light on the secretory mechanisms for amino acids in plants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003335","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.021642","issns":["1040-4651"],"issue":"7","journal":"Plant Cell","last_mentioned_on":1089331200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15208395"],"pmid":"15208395","pubdate":"2004-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Overexpression of GLUTAMINE DUMPER1 leads to hypersecretion of glutamine from Hydathodes of Arabidopsis leaves.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overexpression-glutamine-dumper1-leads-hypersecretion-glutamine-hydathodes-arabidopsis-leaves"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":2015191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2730174,"mean":5.2107909249744,"rank":1475518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":750086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2730174,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1916,"mean":2.5717169712794,"rank":904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1916,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1477,"mean":2.0986856368564,"rank":540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1477,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
