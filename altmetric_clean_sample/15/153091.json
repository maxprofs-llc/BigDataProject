The functional analyses of the factor H mutant proteins purified from some of these patients have shown a specific defect in the capacity to control complement activation on cellular surfaces. Here, we show that these factor H-related complement regulatory defects can be detected in the patients' serum with a simple hemolytic assay. Data obtained from HUS patients and control individuals indicate that this assay is a useful tool for the molecular diagnosis of factor H-related HUS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003116","doi":"10.1016\/j.molimm.2004.01.003","issns":["0161-5890"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1149120000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15140578"],"pmid":"15140578","pubdate":"2004-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Functional analysis in serum from atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome patients reveals impaired protection of host cells associated with mutations in factor H.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functional-analysis-serum-atypical-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-patients-reveals-impaired-protection-ho"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634284,"mean":4.9206846148246,"rank":2015309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634284,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2730484,"mean":5.2102252780955,"rank":1475631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":750379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2730484,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":587,"mean":2.0796450511945,"rank":358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":587,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":545,"mean":2.0200919117647,"rank":329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":545,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
