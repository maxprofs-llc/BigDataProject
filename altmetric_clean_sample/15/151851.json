This will undoubtedly hamper attempts to characterize their structure by classical crystallographic or solution NMR methods. Here we show that encapsulation of a metastable protein within the restricted volume a reverse micelle can be used to force fold the protein and allow its characterization by modern methods of NMR spectroscopy. This may have significant utility in the context of structural proteomics. In addition, variation of the inner volume of the reverse micelle can be used to probe the character of the manifold of unfolded states.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","doi":"10.1021\/ja047900q","issns":["0002-7863"],"issue":"31","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1095811200,"pmid":"15291527","pubdate":"2004-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Forced folding and structural analysis of metastable proteins.","type":"article","volume":"126","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/forced-folding-structural-analysis-metastable-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":2017387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726585,"mean":5.2278689730476,"rank":1477392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":741026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726585,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12981,"mean":4.1188833590139,"rank":8147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12981,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12893,"mean":4.0610786534285,"rank":8070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12893,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Ph.
