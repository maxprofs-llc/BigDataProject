Like language, music is a human universal involving perceptually discrete elements organized into hierarchically structured sequences. Music and language can thus serve as foils for each other in the study of brain mechanisms underlying complex sound processing, and comparative research can provide novel insights into the functional and neural architecture of both domains. This review focuses on syntax, using recent neuroimaging data and cognitive theory to propose a specific point of convergence between syntactic processing in language and music. This leads to testable predictions, including the prediction that that syntactic comprehension problems in Broca's aphasia are not selective to language but influence music perception as well.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","authors":["Aniruddh D Patel"],"doi":"10.1038\/nn1082","endpage":"681","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["10976256","1097-6256","1546-1726","ERROR!
