The Arabidpsis phot1 phot2 double mutant lacks all of these responses. To confirm the requirement of phototropins in BL responses, the Arabidopsis phot1 phot2 double mutant was transformed with PHOT1 cDNA and the phenotypic restoration was analysed in the transformants. It was found that all BL responses were restored, although differentially, by the transformation of the Arabidopsis phot1 phot2 double mutant with PHOT1 cDNA. The results showed that phot1 was an essential component for all these BL responses in planta, and that the cellular level of phot1 might determine the individual BL responses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fdd","doi":"10.1093\/jxb\/erh044","issns":["0022-0957"],"issue":"396","journal":"Journal of Experimental Botany","last_mentioned_on":1077062400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14739272"],"pmid":"14739272","pubdate":"2004-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"A transgene encoding a blue-light receptor, phot1, restores blue-light responses in the Arabidopsis phot1 phot2 double mutant.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transgene-encoding-bluelight-receptor-phot1-restores-bluelight-responses-arabidopsis-phot1-phot2-dou"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632750,"mean":4.9231796234803,"rank":2015198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632750,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2729321,"mean":5.211653315848,"rank":1475476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":748965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2729321,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1451,"mean":2.4609310344828,"rank":836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1451,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":910,"mean":2.3971353135314,"rank":469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":910,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
