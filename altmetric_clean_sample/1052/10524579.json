This study explored the expectations of Tamil-speaking patients with cancer and their families with respect to receiving their cancer diagnosis in northern Sri Lanka.\nThis exploratory, descriptive, qualitative study used semistructured interviews.\nThematic analysis identified two major themes: communication and information seeking. The findings illustrate a discrepancy between patient preference for direct disclosure of the diagnosis and that of families. Ninety-five percent of patients wanted medical staff to disclose their cancer diagnosis, whereas only 45% of family members believed that the diagnosis should be disclosed to the patient rather than to the family.\nAlthough patients and their family members' views and expectations of the disclosure of diagnosis and prognosis differ, a majority of patients want to be told directly about their diagnosis rather than to learn of it from a relative. The findings are similar to the literature on other ethnic groups from Sri Lanka and studies from English-speaking developed countries. Therefore, the main questions are how to educate families and physicians about the benefits of open disclosure to patients and how to change culture. Results of this study along with a previous study call for the development of strategies and guidelines to improve societal views, educate patients and families, and train health professionals in the area of breaking bad news and discussing prognosis in the Sri Lankan setting.","altmetric_jid":"5697ba3c2a83eee21d8b4567","authors":["Chrishanthi Rajasooriyar","Jenny Kelly","Thanikai Sivakumar","Gowcikan Navanesan","Shahini Nadarasa","Madona Hashanthy Sriskandarajah","Sabe Sabesan"],"doi":"10.1200\/jgo.2016.005355","first_seen_on":"2016-08-15T19:31:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2378-9506"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Global Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1472607809,"links":["http:\/\/jgo.ascopubs.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/05\/JGO.2016.005355","http:\/\/jgo.ascopubs.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/05\/JGO.2016.005355.full?cmpid=sk_jgo_earlyrel_ascoex_-_all_08-30-16_read&et_cid=38291031&et_rid=1384739378&linkid=Breaking%20Bad%20News%20in%20Ethnic%20Settings:%20Perspectives%20of%20Patients%20and%20Families%20in%20Northern%20Sri%20Lanka#.V8Y1yVD9iIo.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jgo.ascopubs.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/05\/JGO.2016.005355.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5493221","pmid":"28717767","pubdate":"2016-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Breaking Bad News in Ethnic Settings: Perspectives of Patients and Families in Northern Sri Lanka","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/breaking-bad-news-ethnic-settings-perspectives-patients-families-northern-sri-lanka-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":3497102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4757691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256931,"mean":11.993286770715,"rank":98545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":155653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256931,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242,"mean":8.7402987551867,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":4.8837837837838,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JGO_ASCO\/statuses\/765269567165853702","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10524579],"posted_on":"2016-08-15T19:30:57+00:00","author":{"name":"J Global Oncology","url":"http:\/\/JGO.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/715983614903775232\/sS61TZtL_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Global Oncology is an open-access @ASCO journal focused on cancer care & research issues unique to limited-resource settings.","id_on_source":"JGO_ASCO","tweeter_id":"4854885424","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2105},"tweet_id":"765269567165853702"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GlopesMd\/statuses\/766335587167133696","license":"gnip","rt":["JGO_ASCO"],"citation_ids":[10524579],"posted_on":"2016-08-18T18:06:56+00:00","author":{"name":"gilberto lopes","url":"http:\/\/br.linkedin.com\/in\/drgilbertolopes","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/717018715343159296\/6XfyLguN_normal.jpg","description":"Cancer Doctor and Researcher, Faculty @SylvesterCancer @UnivMiami.
