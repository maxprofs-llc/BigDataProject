The exact pathophysiology remains unknown, but the inflammatory vascular response is thought to play an important role. In the present study we demonstrate that targeted liposomal delivery of prednisolone increases outward remodeling of the AVF in a murine model. Liposomes accumulate in the post-anastomotic area of the venous outflow tract in which the vascular pathology is most prominent in failed AVFs. On a histological level, we observed a reduction of lymphocytes and granulocytes in the vascular wall. In addition, a strong anti-inflammatory effect of liposomal prednisolone on macrophages was demonstrated in vitro. Therefore, treatment with liposomal prednisolone might be a valuable strategy to improve AVF maturation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["ChunYu Wong","Taisiya Bezhaeva","Tonia C.
