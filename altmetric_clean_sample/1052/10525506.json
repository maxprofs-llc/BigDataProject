Pairs of children and parents were recruited from a school-based sample of third- and fourth-grade students, enrolling 362 child and parent pairs. The content validity, construct validity, convergent validity, internal consistency, and inter-rater reliability of the CSAQ were assessed.\nThe CSAQ comprised three parts: sleep hygiene, sleep quality, and sleep disturbance. Sleep hygiene showed a moderate intra-class correlation coefficient (0.37-0.66) between children and parents. Results of exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor structure model for sleep quality with 64.9% of variance and a two-factor structure for sleep disturbance with 57.7% of variance. These two models also demonstrated good fit with the confirmatory factor analysis.\nThe CSAQ is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing sleep problems in school-aged children.\nBoth clinicians and researchers can use the CSAQ to screen or elucidate the children' sleep problems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a86","authors":["Hsiao-Ling Chuang","Ching-Pyng Kuo","Cheng-Ching Liu","Chia-Ying Li","Wen-Chun Liao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pedn.2016.07.008","first_seen_on":"2016-08-15T21:27:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8449"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1471296406,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.pediatricnursing.org\/article\/S0882-5963(16)30147-6\/fulltext?rss%3Dyes%26utm_source%3Dtwitterfeed%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&rc=0&code=yjpdn-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricnursing.org\/article\/S0882596316301476\/pdf","pmid":"27538344","pubdate":"2016-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","pediatrics"],"title":"The Development and Psychometric Properties of the Children's Sleep Assessment Questionnaire in Taiwan","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-psychometric-properties-childrens-sleep-assessment-questionnaire-taiwan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":6241284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1106275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255631,"mean":12.009010742088,"rank":181572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255631,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":445,"mean":3.2422027027027,"rank":263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":445,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.0641666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
