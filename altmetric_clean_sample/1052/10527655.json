Mesembrenone and mesembrine are the two main pharmacologically active alkaloids present in the extract. Despite the wide therapeutic applications of Sceletium extract, there are no reports of in vivo pharmacokinetic properties or analytical methods to quantify these two important alkaloids in plasma. Therefore, the current study was aimed to develop and validate a simple and sensitive analytical method for simultaneous quantification of mesembrenone and mesembrine in mouse plasma. Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC\/QToF-MS) was employed to achieve our objectives. The compounds were extracted using protein precipitation method by methanol (100%) with quinine as an internal standard. The lower limit of quantification for both the compounds was 10\u2009ng\/m. The extraction recovery was between 87% - 93% for both compounds with no matrix effects on the analysis. The accuracy was between 89.5 and 106 % and precision was\u2009<\u200912.6 % for all QC samples. This validated method was successfully applied to evaluate the IV plasma pharmacokinetics of mesembrine and mesembrenone in mouse. However, the oral bioavailability of these alkaloids was poor and the plasma levels were under the detection limits.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c74","authors":["Manda, Vamshi K.","Avula, Bharathi","Mohammad K., Ashfaq","Abe, Naohito","Khan, Ikhlas A.","Khan, Shabana I.","Ashfaq, Mohammad K."],"doi":"10.1002\/bmc.3815","first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T02:23:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1099-0801"],"journal":"Biomedical Chromatography","last_mentioned_on":1471318523,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/bmc.3815&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/bmc.3815"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bmc.3815\/pdf","pmid":"27526669","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Quantification of mesembrine and mesembrenone in mouse plasma using UHPLC\u2010QToF\u2010MS: Application to a pharmacokinetic study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantification-mesembrine-mesembrenone-mouse-plasma-using-uhplcqtofms-application-pharmacokinetic-st"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":897055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7314419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233175,"mean":12.389202115158,"rank":37862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":194629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233175,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":661,"mean":2.4622515151515,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":661,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/samplesprep\/statuses\/765373215233314816","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10527655],"posted_on":"2016-08-16T02:22:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Sample Preparation","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_5_normal.png","id_on_source":"samplesprep","tweeter_id":"3010341087","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":4},"tweet_id":"765373215233314816"}],"news":[{"title":"Quantification of mesembrine and mesembrenone in mouse plasma using UHPLC\u2010QToF\u2010MS: Application to a pharmacokinetic study","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27723693937&p=1pl&v=1&x=dvCNdUYdGID704hfiBVoSQ","license":"public","citation_ids":[10527655],"posted_on":"2016-08-16T03:35:23+00:00","summary":"Abstract Sceletium tortuosum, is an indigenous herb of South Africa which is widely used as an herbal supplement in the treatment of anxiety and stress.","author":{"name":"Bionity","url":"http:\/\/www.bionity.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/914\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-02-02_at_15.18.55.png?1454426347"}}]}}
