The aim of this study was to analyse antiretroviral treatment efficacy in Poland and to identify variables associated with virologic suppression.\nethods Cross-sectional data on 5152 (56.92% of the countrywide treated at the time-point of analysis) patients on cART for more than six months with at least one HIV-RNA measurement in 2016 were collected from 14 Polish centres. Patients' characteristics and treatment type-based outcomes were analysed for the virologic suppression thresholds of <50 and <200 HIV-RNA copies\/ml. CART was categorized into two nucleos(t)ide (2NRTI) plus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) inhibitors, 2NRTI plus protease (PI) inhibitor, 2NRTI plus integrase (InI) inhibitor, nucleos(t)ide sparing PI\/r+InI and three drug class regimens. For statistics Chi-square and U-Mann Whitney tests and adjusted multivariate logistic regression models were used.\nVirologic suppression rates of <50 copies\/mL were observed in 4672 (90.68%) and <200 copies\/mL in 4934 (95.77%) individuals. In univariate analyses, for the suppression threshold <50 copies\/mL higher efficacy was noted for 2NRTI+NNRTI-based combinations (94.73%) compared to 2NRTI+PI (89.93%), 2NRTI+InI (90.61%), nucleos(t)ide sparing PI\/r+InI (82.02%) and three drug class regimens (74.49%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), with less pronounced but significant differences for the threshold of 200 copies\/mL [2NRTI+NNRTI-97.61%, 2NRTI+PI-95.27%, 2NRTI+InI-96.61%, PI\/r+InI- 95.51% and 86.22% for three drug class cART) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). However, in multivariate model, virologic efficacy for viral load <50 copies\/mL was similar across treatment groups with significant influence by history of AIDS [OR:1.48 (95%CI:1.01-2.17) if AIDS diagnosed, p\u00a0=\u00a00.046], viral load < 5 log copies\/mL at care entry [OR:1.47 (95%CI:1.08-2.01), p\u00a0=\u00a00.016], baseline lymphocyte CD4 count \u2265200 cells\/\u00b5L [OR:1.72 (95%CI:1.04-2.78), p\u00a0=\u00a00.034] and negative HCV serology [OR:1.97 (95%CI:1.29-2.94), p\u00a0=\u00a00.002]. For viral load threshold <200 copies\/mL higher likelihood of virologic success was only associated with baseline lymphocyte CD4 count \u2265200 cells\/\u00b5L [OR:2.08 (95%CI:1.01-4.35), p\u00a0=\u00a00.049] and negative HCV\u00a0status [OR:2.84 (95%CI:1.52-5.26), p\u00a0=\u00a00.001].\nProportion of virologically suppressed patients is in line with WHO treatment target confirming successful application of antiretroviral treatment strategy in Poland. Virological suppression rates depend on baseline patient characteristics, which should guide individualized antiretroviral tre0atment decisions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000867","authors":["Milosz Parczewski","Ewa Siwak","Magdalena Leszczyszyn-Pynka","Iwona Cielniak","Ewa Burkacka","Piotr Pulik","Adam Witor","Karolina Muller","Ewelina Zasik","Anna Grzeszczuk","Maria Jankowska","Ma\u0142gorzata Lema\u0144ska","Anita Olczak","Edyta Gr\u0105bczewska","Aleksandra Szymczak","Jacek G\u0105siorowski","Bartosz Szetela","Monika Boci\u0105ga-Jasik","Pawe\u0142 Skwara","Magdalena Witak-J\u0119dra","El\u017cbieta Jab\u0142onowska","Kamila W\u00f3jcik-Cichy","Juliusz Kamerys","Ma\u0142gorzata Janczarek","Dagny Krankowska","Tomasz Miku\u0142a","Katarzyna Kozie\u0142","Dariusz Bielec","Justyna Stempkowska","Aleksandra Kocbach","Wies\u0142awa B\u0142udzin","Andrzej Horban"],"doi":"10.7448\/ias.20.1.21847","first_seen_on":"2017-08-21T16:01:48+00:00","issns":["1758-2652"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of the International AIDS Society","last_mentioned_on":1503331294,"links":["http:\/\/jiasociety.org\/index.php\/jias\/article\/view\/21847"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jiasociety.org\/index.php\/jias\/article\/view\/21847\/pdf","pmid":"28715160","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Meeting the WHO 90% target: antiretroviral treatment efficacy in Poland is associated with baseline clinical patient characteristics","type":"article","volume":"20"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":6080363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2027701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167554,"mean":12.661737850113,"rank":108680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":48704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167554,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1076,"mean":5.9109004651163,"rank":853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1076,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":9.7458333333333,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jiasociety\/statuses\/899662773965250562","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24144923],"posted_on":"2017-08-21T16:01:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Journal of the IAS","url":"http:\/\/www.jiasociety.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2881440289\/5f6fdfba979c4b22d32c39e7d2cf6524_normal.png","description":"The Journal of the International AIDS Society is an open access, peer-reviewed journal publishing HIV research with a focus on resource-limited settings","id_on_source":"jiasociety","tweeter_id":"964200672","geo":{"lt":46.16667,"ln":6.16667,"country":"CH"},"followers":944},"tweet_id":"899662773965250562"}],"facebook":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10155709571024697&id=296268839696","license":"public","citation_ids":[24144923],"posted_on":"2017-08-21T16:00:00+00:00","summary":"The third of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets is 90% viral suppression among people on antiretroviral therapy.
