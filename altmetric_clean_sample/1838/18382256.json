The novelty of our method is sonar and polarimetric radar data fusion, extraction of features for separate swathes of illuminated surface (segmentation), and using of multi-stage artificial neural network for surface classification. The developed system consists of 24 GHz radar and 40 kHz ultrasonic sensor. The features are extracted from backscattered signals and then the procedures of principal component analysis and supervised classification are applied to feature data. The special attention is paid to multi-stage artificial neural network which allows an overall increase in classification accuracy. The proposed technique was tested for recognition of a large number of real surfaces in different weather conditions with the average accuracy of correct classification of 95%. The obtained results thereby demonstrate that the use of proposed system architecture and statistical methods allow for reliable discrimination of various road surfaces in real conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Aleksandr Bystrov","Edward Hoare","Thuy-Yung Tran","Nigel Clarke","Marina Gashinova","Mikhail Cherniakov"],"doi":"10.3390\/s17040745","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T10:33:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"4","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1491042802,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/4\/745?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/4\/745\/pdf","pmid":"28368297","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Automotive System for Remote Surface Classification","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/automotive-system-remote-surface-classification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":6408590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1148310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249978,"mean":13.192935294047,"rank":179085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249978,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3487,"mean":1.9984802065404,"rank":1919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3487,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":653,"mean":1.2737392638037,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":653,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/848121101431455745","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18382256],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T10:33:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
