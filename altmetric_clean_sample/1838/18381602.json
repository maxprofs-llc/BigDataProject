However, there are insufficient data about the role of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and other risk factors for recurrence. We aimed to compare the metachronous lesion in the H. pylori persistent group and the eradicated group, and to identify risk factors for metachronous lesion. We retrospectively analyzed 782 patients who underwent ESD between January 2008 and December 2013. We excluded patients with dysplasia or patients who were not tested for H. pylori infection. One hundred eighty-five patients were enrolled. We studied risk factors for recurrence, and used survival analysis to test. There were 24 patients with metachronous recurrence after ESD for EGC among the group. The incidence of metachronous gastric lesions after ESD for EGC developed more in the over 70-year-old group (P = 0.025) and more in the H. pylori persistent group (P = 0.008). In conclusion, H. pylori infection and old age are independent risk factors for metachronous gastric lesions after ESD in EGC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d0e","authors":["Chung, Chang-Su","Woo, Hyun Sun","Chung, Jun-Won","Jeong, Seok Hoo","Kwon, Kwang An","Kim, Yoon Jae","Kim, Kyoung Oh","Park, Dong Kyun"],"doi":"10.3346\/jkms.2017.32.3.421","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T10:15:33+00:00","issns":["1011-8934","1598-6357"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Korean Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1491041712,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28145644?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28145644","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Korean Academy of Medical Sciences (KAMJE)","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Risk Factors for Metachronous Recurrence after Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection of Early Gastric Cancer","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-metachronous-recurrence-after-endoscopic-submucosal-dissection-early-gastric-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249979,"mean":13.192883517749,"rank":206884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249979,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":718,"mean":2.2993668061367,"rank":492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":718,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.1,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/848116528385892352","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18381602],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T10:15:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"848116528385892352"}]}}
