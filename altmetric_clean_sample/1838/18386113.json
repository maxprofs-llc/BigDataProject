To evaluate the diagnostic values of this technique in myelofibrosis, (18)F-FLT PET imaging results were compared with bone marrow histology and bone marrow scintigraphy (BMS), the gold standard techniques in this clinical situation. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients with histology-proven myelofibrosis (MF) were included consecutively in the study. Tracers' distributions were assessed using a visual grading assessment score of the uptake in axial skeleton, proximal and distal limbs, liver and spleen. This visual score was used to define patterns of tracer distribution and to compare the information provided either by PET or BMS. A semi-quantitative analysis with determination of SUVmax in the same localizations was performed for (18)F-FLT PET. Results: The histology grade of fibrosis correlated with the SUVmax in the axial skeleton (spine and iliac crests) and proximal limbs. (18)F-FLT uptake in these areas was much lower in patients with grade 3 fibrosis, than in patients with grade 1 or 2 fibrosis. (18)F-FLT PET showed the same distribution of uptake as BMS in 13 out of 14 patients (one patient did not undergo BMS). In one patient (18)F-FLT PET clearly showed an intense abnormal splenic uptake, whereas spleen uptake was inconclusive with BMS. Conclusion:(18)F-FLT PET appears to be a reliable and convenient technique to assess hematopoietic activity in bone marrow. It yields results very close to those observed with BMS. In our study population (18)F-FLT uptake in axial skeleton and proximal limbs assessed by SUVmax correlated with the grade of fibrosis. Thus (18)F-FLT PET may be a useful tool to measure the severity of myelofibrosis, and to monitor non-invasively the patients' status during follow-up. Finally, (18)F-FLT PET may be foreseen as an alternative to BMS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["Vercellino, Laetitia","Ouvrier, Matthieu-John","Barr\u00e9, Emmanuelle","Cassinat, Bruno","De Beco, Virginie","Dosquet, Christine","Chevret, Sylvie","Meignin, V\u00e9ronique","Chomienne, Christine","Toubert, Marie-Elisabeth","Merlet, Pascal","Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques","Laetitia Vercellino","Matthieu-John Ouvrier","Emmanuelle Barr\u00e9","Bruno Cassinat","Virginie De Beco","Christine Dosquet","Sylvie Chevret","V\u00e9ronique Meignin","Christine Chomienne","Marie-Elisabeth Toubert","Pascal Merlet","Jean-Jacques Kiladjian"],"doi":"10.2967\/jnumed.116.188508","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T15:09:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0161-5505","2159-662X","1535-5667"],"journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1493423676,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28360204?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jnm.snmjournals.org\/content\/early\/2017\/03\/29\/jnumed.116.188508.long"],"pmid":"28360204","pubdate":"2017-04-01T22:07:25+00:00","publisher":"Society of Nuclear Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"\n            Assessing bone marrow activity in patients with myelofibrosis: results of a pilot study of\n            18\n            F-FLT PET\n          ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessing-bone-marrow-activity-patients-myelofibrosis-results-pilot-study-18fflt-pet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":3.2,"6m":3.2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8138092,"mean":6.879675480889,"rank":2014312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6107010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8138092,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238264,"mean":13.140697749965,"rank":80067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":157350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238264,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2166,"mean":4.3629357967667,"rank":415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":1749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2166,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":6.7618235294118,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"FR":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/statuses\/848190606522277888","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18386113],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T15:09:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24806},"tweet_id":"848190606522277888"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jjkiladjian\/statuses\/856899853468798976","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18386113],"posted_on":"2017-04-25T15:57:00+00:00","author":{"name":"J.J.
