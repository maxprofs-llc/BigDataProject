Also known as hand-foot syndrome, it is not life-threatening, but does decrease quality of life. Dysesthesia, erythema, edema, and desquamation on palmoplantar region are observed clinically. Palmoplantar dysesthesia syndrome may be caused by chemotherapeutics including cytarabine, doxorubicin, capecitabine, epirubicin, docetaxel, vinorelbine, and 5-fluorouracil. The case of a 62-year-old woman who presented with diffuse erythema on palmoplantar area after use of capecitabine for metastatic breast carcinoma is described in the present report. Palmoplantar dysesthesia syndrome caused by capecitabine may affect patient compliance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6f13cf058f61000a0de","authors":["Elmas, \u00d6mer Faruk","Metin, Mahmut Sami","K\u0131z\u0131lyel, Okan","Akta\u015f, Ak\u0131n","Birdal, Canan"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T10:30:22+00:00","issns":["1300-0012"],"issue":"1","journal":"Agri: The Journal of The Turkish Society of Algology","last_mentioned_on":1491042609,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27225615?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27225615","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"[A case of palmoplantar dysesthesia syndrome caused by capecitabine].","type":"article","volume":"28"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249979,"mean":13.192881517573,"rank":206884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249979,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":0.6954128440367,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/848120289875578881","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18382106],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T10:30:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":723},"tweet_id":"848120289875578881"}]}}
