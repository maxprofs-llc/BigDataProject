The aim of this study was to identify pre-operative predictors associated with these poor clinical outcomes.\nAll patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0635; mean age 69; male 67.4%) who underwent surgical LER over a 5 year period in a single tertiary vascular institution were identified. Patients considered to have suffered a poor outcome (Group A) included all in-hospital mortality and major amputations, delayed discharges with a length of stay (LOS) over one standard deviation above the mean or any readmission under any specialty within 12 months. Group A included 247 patients (38.9%) and the good outcome group included the remaining 388 patients (61.1%) from which a sample of 99 patients were selected as controls (Group B).\nMean LOS for the entire study group was 14.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.5 days, 12 month readmission rate was 29.1% and in-hospital mortality and major amputation rate was 2.7% and 1.4%, respectively. Pre-admission residence other than own home (OR 9.0; 95% CI 1.2-70.1; P\u00a0=\u00a00.036), atherosclerotic disease burden (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3-3.8; P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and tissue loss (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.6-5.3; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were identified as independent, statistically significant pre-operative predictors of poor outcome. Following discharge, group B patients had a significantly higher rate of amputation free survival and graft infection free survival (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared to group A.\nRecognition of pre-operative predictors of poor outcome should inform case selection and identify high risk patients requiring intensive perioperative optimisation and post discharge follow up.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f1","authors":["Mohammed Ashrafi","Rohini Salvadi","Philip Foden","Stephanie Thomas","Mohamed Baguneid"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijsu.2017.03.057","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T13:11:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["17439191"],"journal":"International Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1491052267,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1743919117302777&_version=1&md5=f870447a02790f39bf2afd0ef2bba9be"],"pmid":"28344160","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Pre-operative predictors of poor outcomes in patients undergoing surgical lower extremity revascularisation \u2013 Retrospective cohort study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preoperative-predictors-poor-outcomes-patients-undergoing-surgical-lower-extremity-revascularisation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":6408590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1148303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249978,"mean":13.192955495905,"rank":179088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249978,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1220,"mean":2.0393699753897,"rank":599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1220,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":1.2619652173913,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
