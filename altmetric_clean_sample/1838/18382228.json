His sister, also with a BRCA2 mutation, was diagnosed with breast cancer in her late forties; she also had bilateral supernumerary nipples. We address the significance of breast cancer arising in breast tissue underlying supernumerary nipples; the known association between supernumerary nipples and genitourinary malignancies\/malformations and the possible link between BRCA2 and supernumerary nipple development. We believe that this is the first described case of the latter. We then outline an approach to further management for supernumerary nipple cases.","authors":["Michael McKay","Ryan Coad"],"doi":"10.21037\/atm.2017.03.02","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T10:32:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["23055839","23055847","2305-5839"],"issue":"5","journal":"Annals of translational medicine","last_mentioned_on":1492669454,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28361071?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28361071\/?i=2&from=brca2","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5360625\/"],"pmcid":"PMC5360625","pmid":"28361071","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AME Publications","title":"A brother and sister with breast cancer, BRCA2 mutations and bilateral supernumerary nipples","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brother-sister-breast-cancer-brca2-mutations-bilateral-supernumerary-nipples"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.9,"score_history":{"1y":7.9,"6m":7.9,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.9},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":13}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":6,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/848120651462332418","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18382228],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T10:31:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":722},"tweet_id":"848120651462332418"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/knitz22\/statuses\/848161693070876673","license":"gnip","rt":["CancerPapers"],"citation_ids":[18382228],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T13:14:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Ken Nitz","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/823583909967327233\/mAKB47FZ_normal.jpg","description":"Ideas and things","id_on_source":"knitz22","tweeter_id":"217562602","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":114},"tweet_id":"848161693070876673"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LguzzardiM\/statuses\/848921000985186304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18382228],"posted_on":"2017-04-03T15:31:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Lisa M Guzzardi, RN","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/420494918068983\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643272867124264960\/10aQ8fO0_normal.jpg","description":"#HBOC #PatientAdvocate dedicated to providing up to date evidence based research for 2.7 K 'SoMe' consumers @ risk & clinicians #JournalClub #bcsm #gyncsm #BRCA","id_on_source":"LguzzardiM","tweeter_id":"2432381543","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5565},"tweet_id":"848921000985186304"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/letlifehappen\/statuses\/848922490684493825","license":"gnip","rt":["LguzzardiM"],"citation_ids":[18382228],"posted_on":"2017-04-03T15:37:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Barbara Jacoby","url":"http:\/\/www.letlifehappen.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/855913844476071936\/Oh37o3mG_normal.jpg","description":"Award winning #breastcancer info and Inspirational Stories since 2008 | @HuffPost, #Health | IG: LetLifeHappen | Founded by Barbara Jacoby","id_on_source":"letlifehappen","tweeter_id":"12511062","geo":{"lt":34.05223,"ln":-118.24368,"country":"US"},"followers":23533},"tweet_id":"848922490684493825"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DiepFlapBreast\/statuses\/848926988043726848","license":"gnip","rt":["LguzzardiM"],"citation_ids":[18382228],"posted_on":"2017-04-03T15:55:40+00:00","author":{"name":"PRMA Plastic Surgery","url":"https:\/\/PRMA-enhance.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2238904031\/PRMA-Aquare-FB_normal.jpg","description":"PRMA #PlasticSurgery specializes in advanced #breastreconstruction after #breastcancer - DIEP, SIEA, GAP, TUG, Fat Grafting & One-Step.
