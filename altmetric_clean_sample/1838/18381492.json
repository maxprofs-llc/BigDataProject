Historically, contact dermatitis has played a significant role in the evolution of dermatology as the understanding of a relationship between environmental exposure and specific skin disease became more widely accepted. Reports about this relationship can be found throughout the history of humanity, thousands of years ago. The Egyptians were perhaps the first to document this relationship in ancient history, and documentation has also been found in several other cultures and nations such as the Chinese, Indians, Europeans, and American colonizers. The patch test emerged over a century ago and has remained a powerful tool for diagnosing and directing patients. This paper provides historical and curious facts about contact dermatitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008cd0","authors":["Clinton Enos","Massimo Fioranelli","Katlein Fran\u00e7a","David Castillo","Torello Lotti","Uwe Wollina","Maria Grazia Roccia"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10354-017-0556-4","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T10:13:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0043-5341","1563-258X"],"journal":"Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift (WMW)","last_mentioned_on":1491041596,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28357521"],"pmid":"28357521","pubdate":"2017-04-01T22:14:44+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"General Practice \/ Family Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Geriatrics\/Gerontology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Contact dermatitis: a\u00a0historical perspective","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contact-dermatitis-historical-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249978,"mean":13.192933293863,"rank":206884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249978,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":2.7441148325359,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.075,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Chimienaturels\/statuses\/848116044405387264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18381492],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T10:13:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Ga\u00eblle Queignec","url":"https:\/\/fr.linkedin.com\/in\/gaellequeignec","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793009376206487552\/OVI-EP8s_normal.jpg","description":"Enchant\u00e9s par #cosm\u00e9tiques #cosmetics #parfums #ingredients  #biotech #chimie #sciences ?Partageons inspiration #innovations #veille  #r\u00e9glementations #job #PhD","id_on_source":"Chimienaturels","tweeter_id":"40194332","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":590},"tweet_id":"848116044405387264"}]}}
