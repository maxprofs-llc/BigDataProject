KS is generally characterized by azoospermia; approximately 10% of cases have severe oligozoospermia. Among these, the 30-40% of patients show hypospermatogenesis. The mechanisms leading to adult testis dysfunctions are not completely understood. A microarray transcriptome analysis was performed on testis biopsies obtained from three KS patients with hypospermatogenesis and three control subjects. KS testis showed a differential up- and down-regulation of 303 and 747 transcripts, respectively, as compared to controls. The majority of down-regulated transcripts were involved in spermiogenesis failure and testis morphological defects, whereas up-regulated genes were responsible for testis apoptotic processes. Functional analysis of the transcriptionally altered genes indicated a deregulation in cell death, germ cell function and morphology as well as blood-testis-barrier maintenance and Leydig cells activity. These data support a complex scenario in which spermatogenic impairment is the result of functional and morphological alterations in both germinal and somatic components of KS testis. These findings could represent the basis for evaluating new markers of KS spermatogenesis and potential targets of therapeutic intervention to preserve residual spermatogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["D\u2019Aurora, Marco","Ferlin, Alberto","Garolla, Andrea","Franchi, Sara","D\u2019Onofrio, Laura","Trubiani, Oriana","Palka, Giandomenico","Foresta, Carlo","Stuppia, Liborio","Gatta, Valentina"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep45729","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T16:00:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1491062429,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28361989"],"pmid":"28361989","pubdate":"2017-04-01T22:03:20+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gene expression","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular medicine","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Testis Transcriptome Modulation in Klinefelter Patients with Hypospermatogenesis","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/testis-transcriptome-modulation-klinefelter-patients-hypospermatogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249978,"mean":13.192942294691,"rank":206893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249978,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37752,"mean":14.755138565866,"rank":31366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37752,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3520,"mean":18.845318556408,"rank":2829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3520,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
