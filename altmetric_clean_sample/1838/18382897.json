The strand-specific TRO protocol using BrUTP described here is a powerful experimental approach for analyzing the transcription termination defect under physiological conditions. Like the traditional TRO assay, it relies on the presence of a transcriptionally active polymerase beyond the 3' end of the gene as an indicator of a transcription termination defect(1). It overcomes two major problems encountered with the traditional TRO assay. First, it can detect if the polymerase reading through the termination signal is the one that initiated transcription from the promoter-proximal region, or if it is simply representing a pervasively transcribing polymerase that initiated non-specifically from somewhere in the body or the 3' end of the gene. Secondly, it can distinguish if the transcriptionally active polymerase signal beyond the terminator region is truly the readthrough sense mRNA transcribing polymerase or a terminator-initiated non-coding anti-sense RNA signal. Briefly, the protocol involves permeabilizing the exponentially growing yeast cells, allowing the transcripts that initiated in vivo to elongate in the presence of the BrUTP nucleotide, purifying BrUTP-labelled RNA by the affinity approach, reverse transcribing the purified nascent RNA and amplifying the cDNA using strand-specific primers flanking the promoter and the terminator regions of the gene(2).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Zuzer Dhoondia","Ricci Tarockoff","Nadra Alhusini","Scott Medler","Neha Agarwal","Athar Ansari"],"doi":"10.3791\/55446","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T11:03:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-087X"],"issue":"121","journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1491044589,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28362387?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28362387","pubdate":"2017-04-01T22:02:18+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"Analysis of Termination of Transcription Using BrUTP-strand-specific Transcription Run-on (TRO) Approach","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249978,"mean":13.192945494985,"rank":206887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249978,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4317,"mean":3.2747256719184,"rank":3292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149,"mean":3.4384324324324,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/848128595054678016","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18382897],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T11:03:09+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
