It is not clear if the CaMKII holoenzyme functions as an assembly of independent subunits, as catalytic pairs, or as a single unit. One strategy to address this question is to genetically engineer monomeric and dimeric CaMKII and evaluate how their activity compares to the wild-type (WT) holoenzyme. Here a technique that combines fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and homo-FRET analysis was used to characterize assembly mutants of Venus-tagged CaMKII\u03b1 to identify a dimeric CaMKII. Spectroscopy was then used to compare how holoenzyme structure and function changes in response to activation with CaM in the dimeric mutant, WT-holoenzyme, and a monomeric CaMKII oligomerization-domain deletion mutant control. CaM triggered an increase in hydrodynamic volume in both WT and dimeric CaMKII without altering subunit stoichiometry or the net homo-FRET between Venus-tagged catalytic domains. Biochemical analysis revealed that the dimeric mutant also functioned like WT holoenzyme in terms of its kinase activity with an exogenous substrate, and for endogenous T286 autophosphorylation. We conclude that the fundamental functional units of CaMKII holoenzyme are paired catalytic-domains.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["Sarkar, Pabak","Davis, Kaitlin A.","Puhl, Henry L.","Veetil, Jithesh V.","Nguyen, Tuan A.","Vogel, Steven S."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bpj.2017.02.005","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T11:12:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0006-3495","00063495"],"issue":"6","journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1491045149,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/biophysj\/fulltext\/S0006-3495(17)30161-3?rss=yes"],"pmid":"28355553","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Deciphering CaMKII Multimerization Using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy and Homo-FRET Analysis","type":"article","volume":"112","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deciphering-camkii-multimerization-using-fluorescence-correlation-spectroscopy-homofret-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249978,"mean":13.192952495629,"rank":206888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249978,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3192,"mean":4.081514258853,"rank":2765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3192,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":7.5303670886076,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlackPhysicists\/statuses\/848130947174330369","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18383068],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T11:12:29+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16459},"tweet_id":"848130947174330369"}]}}
