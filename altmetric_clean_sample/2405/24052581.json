An important MT regulator is the end binding protein EB, which serves as a scaffold to recruit other MAPs to MT plus ends. In this issue of Structure, Kumar et\u00a0al. (2017) describe LxxPTPh, a new linear sequence motif that can bind EBs. The finding opens up the possibility of discovering new MT regulators.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035d2","authors":["Ishutesh Jain","Phong T.
