We aimed to compare the utility values of the 5-level EuroQoL-5Dimension (EQ-5D-5L) health states elicited from members of the general public and patients with heart disease or cancer.\nIn face-to-face interviews with 157 heart disease patients, 169 cancer patients, and 169 members from the general population, participants valued 10 EQ-5D-5L health states using a composite Time Trade-Off method.\nPooling utility values for all health states, heart disease patients and cancer patients had mean utility values lower by 0.11 points (P value\u00a0=\u00a00.014) and 0.06 points (P value\u00a0=\u00a00.148), respectively, compared to the general population. Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, differences in health state utility values between the patient and the general populations were rendered non-significant, except that heart disease patients gave higher utility values (mean difference\u00a0=\u00a00.08; P value\u00a0=\u00a00.007) to mild health states than the general population. Difference in utility values, defined as utility value of a better health state minus that of a poorer health state, was higher among heart disease patients compared to the general population, before and after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics.\nPatients may differ from members of the general population in the strength of their preferences for hypothetical health states. Using utility values derived from the general population may under-estimate the comparative effectiveness of healthcare interventions for certain diseases, such as heart diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000340e","authors":["Mihir Gandhi","Ru San Tan","Raymond Ng","Su Pin Choo","Whay Kuang Chia","Chee Keong Toh","Carolyn Lam","Phong Teck Lee","Nang Khaing Zar Latt","Kim Rand-Hendriksen","Yin Bun Cheung","Nan Luo"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11136-017-1683-5","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T22:49:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0962-9343","1573-2649"],"journal":"Quality of Life Research","last_mentioned_on":1503400909,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11136-017-1683-5"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11136-017-1683-5.pdf","pmid":"28808840","pubdate":"2017-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quality of Life Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Comparison of health state values derived from patients and individuals from the general population","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-health-state-values-derived-patients-individuals-general-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.8,"score_history":{"1y":3.8,"6m":3.8,"3m":3.8,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":1945622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6464218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177775,"mean":12.784781835364,"rank":50500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":127051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177775,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1337,"mean":3.5533158682635,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1337,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":1.401,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
