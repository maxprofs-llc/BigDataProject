The role of the radiologist is therefore to differentiate these lesions from HCC to avoid under- and overdiagnosis. There are several ways of classifying these lesions: those which predate the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis (cystic lesions, hemangioma), those related to or a consequence of cirrhosis (regenerative nodules, dysplastic nodules, focal fibrosis, peribiliary cysts, shunts, or even cholangiocarcinoma), and those related to the underlying cause of chronic liver disease (lymphoma). Finally, some may develop independently (liver metastases). From an imaging point of view, it is important to remember that the imaging features of pre-existing lesions are not dramatically changed by cirrhosis. Differentiating non-HCC from HCC requires not only an understanding of the multi-step process of hepatocarcinogenesis, but also the importance of medical history, and of complimentary imaging modalities, namely computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This review article gives an overview of the imaging features of benign and malignant non-HCC focal liver lesions in the setting of cirrhosis, with a focus on CT and MR imaging.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002856","authors":["Maxime Ronot","Marco Dioguardi Burgio","Yvonne Purcell","Romain Pommier","Giuseppe Brancatelli","Val\u00e9rie Vilgrain"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejrad.2017.05.040","first_seen_on":"2017-08-18T23:32:50+00:00","issns":["0720048X"],"journal":"European Journal of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1496805332,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0720048X1730219X&_version=1&md5=45f9657d2b9de2994f52444bfab03fd4"],"pmid":"28668410","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Focal lesions in cirrhosis: Not always HCC","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/focal-lesions-cirrhosis-not-always-hcc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":7203274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135473,"mean":12.26769243829,"rank":110981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135473,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1003,"mean":2.4857405189621,"rank":615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1003,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":0.62954545454545,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IllingworthInfo\/statuses\/871551672534913024","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24051684],"posted_on":"2017-06-05T02:18:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Illingworth Library","url":"http:\/\/www.sheffieldchildrens.nhs.uk\/our-services\/library","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/667365783845142528\/bfkqalCj_normal.png","description":"We are an NHS library at Sheffield Children\u2019s Hospital specialising in paediatrics and supporting evidence based practice, professional development and research","id_on_source":"IllingworthInfo","tweeter_id":"423358222","geo":{"lt":53.38297,"ln":-1.4659,"country":"GB"},"followers":312},"tweet_id":"871551672534913024"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IllingworthInfo\/statuses\/871921686337265665","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24051684],"posted_on":"2017-06-06T02:48:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Illingworth Library","url":"http:\/\/www.sheffieldchildrens.nhs.uk\/our-services\/library","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/667365783845142528\/bfkqalCj_normal.png","description":"We are an NHS library at Sheffield Children\u2019s Hospital specialising in paediatrics and supporting evidence based practice, professional development and research","id_on_source":"IllingworthInfo","tweeter_id":"423358222","geo":{"lt":53.38297,"ln":-1.4659,"country":"GB"},"followers":312},"tweet_id":"871921686337265665"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IllingworthInfo\/statuses\/872290905570594816","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24051684],"posted_on":"2017-06-07T03:15:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Illingworth Library","url":"http:\/\/www.sheffieldchildrens.nhs.uk\/our-services\/library","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/667365783845142528\/bfkqalCj_normal.png","description":"We are an NHS library at Sheffield Children\u2019s Hospital specialising in paediatrics and supporting evidence based practice, professional development and research","id_on_source":"IllingworthInfo","tweeter_id":"423358222","geo":{"lt":53.38297,"ln":-1.4659,"country":"GB"},"followers":312},"tweet_id":"872290905570594816"}]}}
