Herein, we report that Rbm4a(-\/-) mice exhibited hyperlipidemia accompanied with reduced mass of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT). Elevated RBM4a led to the isoform shift of IR, Ppar-\u03b3, and Pref-1 genes which play pivotal roles in the different stages of adipogenesis. Overexpression of RBM4a enhanced the mitochondrial activity of brown adipocyte-like lineage in the presence of uncoupling agent. RBM4a-ablated adipocytes inversely exhibited impaired development and inefficient energy expenditure. Intriguingly, overexpressed RBM4a induced the expression of brown adipocyte-specific factors (Prdm16 and Bmp7) in white adipocyte-like lineage, which suggested the potential action of RBM4a on the white-to-brown trans-differentiation of adipocytes. In differentiating adipocytes, RBM4a constituted a feed-forward circuit through autoregulating the splicing pattern of its own transcript. Based on these results, we propose the emerging role of RBM4 in regulating the adipocyte-specific splicing events and transcription cascade, which subsequently facilitate the development and function of brown adipocyte-like cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Lin JC","Tarn WY","Hsieh WK"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbamcr.2013.12.018","first_seen_on":"2014-04-26T10:21:50+00:00","issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1398507579,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24389249?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24389249"],"pmid":"24389249","pubdate":"2014-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Emerging role for RNA binding motif protein 4 in the development of brown adipocytes.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emerging-role-rna-binding-motif-protein-4-development-brown-adipocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3693180,"mean":4.9616789454321,"rank":2793591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":738472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3693180,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95082,"mean":7.0840104332095,"rank":71549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95082,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3880,"mean":2.5505656096932,"rank":3106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3880,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":1.0525,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1},"mendeley":{"KR":1,"SE":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Emerging role for RNA binding motif pro...
