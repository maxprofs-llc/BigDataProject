Circulation and \"reverse fountain\" cytoplasmic streaming constitute the typical forms by which most organelles (such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus) in plant root hair cells engage in bidirectional movement. However, there remains a lack of in-depth research regarding the relationship between the distribution of the actin cytoskeleton and turnaround organelle movement in plant root hair cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yu Zhang","Xiaojing Sheng","Xiangfei Meng","Yan Li"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0091501","first_seen_on":"2014-04-27T23:50:34+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1398642583,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0091501"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0091501.pdf","pmid":"24626218","pubdate":"2014-03-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e91501","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Circular F-Actin Bundles Provide a Track for Turnaround and Bidirectional Movement of Mitochondria in Arabidopsis Root Hair","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circular-factin-bundles-provide-track-turnaround-bidirectional-movement-mitochondria-arabidopsis-roo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3073772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":951972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108690,"mean":7.7116560461502,"rank":73862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108690,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80037,"mean":8.3320977809987,"rank":56116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80037,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3440,"mean":10.816101773771,"rank":2777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3440,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
