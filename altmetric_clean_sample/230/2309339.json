The secretion of innate interferons, both type I and type III, by dendritic cells is severely impaired in aged subjects. This review focuses on the mechanisms responsible for the reduced interferon secretion by dendritic cells and the role this plays in the increased susceptibility of the elderly to infections, particularly of the respiratory mucosa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000296e","authors":["Agrawal A"],"doi":"10.1159\/000350536","first_seen_on":"2014-04-28T11:59:52+00:00","issns":["0304-324X"],"issue":"","journal":"Gerontology","last_mentioned_on":1398686288,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23615484?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23615484","pubdate":"2013-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Mechanisms and Implications of Age-Associated Impaired Innate Interferon Secretion by Dendritic Cells: A Mini-Review.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanisms-implications-ageassociated-impaired-innate-interferon-secretion-dendritic-cells-minirevie"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3700900,"mean":4.9679528352468,"rank":2061248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":955933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3700900,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96307,"mean":7.0742408157332,"rank":49938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":25420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96307,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":4.7641630434783,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.4026666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
