Although many syndromes have been associated with an increased risk for PC, familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) accounts for the majority of hereditary cases. FPC is defined by families with at least a pair of first-degree relatives (FDRs) who have been diagnosed with PC and do not fulfill the criteria of other inherited tumor syndromes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c99","authors":["Aikaterini Mastoraki","Victoria Chatzimavridou-Grigoriadou","Varvara Chatzipetrou","Sotiria Mastoraki","Ioannis S Papanikolaou","Nikolaos Danias","Vasilios Smyrniotis","Nikolaos Arkadopoulos"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12029-014-9609-8","first_seen_on":"2014-04-24T18:48:02+00:00","issns":["1941-6636"],"journal":"Journal of Gastrointestinal Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1427883936,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24756831\/?i=1&from=BRCA2","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24756831?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24756831","pubdate":"2014-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Radiotherapy","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","gastroenterology"],"title":"Familial Pancreatic Cancer: Challenging Diagnostic Approach and Therapeutic Management.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/familial-pancreatic-cancer-challenging-diagnostic-approach-therapeutic-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4946937,"mean":5.8656132321126,"rank":2452221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2345116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4946937,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121196,"mean":7.9562153719214,"rank":55250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":61758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121196,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":1.0350549450549,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.3125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
