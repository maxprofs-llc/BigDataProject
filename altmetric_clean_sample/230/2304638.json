Seven double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs; dsRNAs 1 to 7 with sizes of 3,654, 2,773, 2,597, 2,574, 1,823, 1,623, and 511 bp, respectively) were identified in an isolate of B. dothidea exhibiting attenuated growth and virulence and a sectoring phenotype. Characterization of the dsRNAs revealed that they belong to two dsRNA mycoviruses. The four largest dsRNAs (dsRNAs 1 to 4) are the genomic components of a novel member of the family Chrysoviridae (tentatively designated Botryosphaeria dothidea chrysovirus 1 [BdCV1]), a view supported by the morphology of the virions and phylogenetic analysis of the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Two other dsRNAs (dsRNAs 5 and 6) are the genomic components of a novel member of the family Partitiviridae (tentatively designated Botryosphaeria dothidea partitivirus 1 [BdPV1]), which is placed in a clade distinct from other established partitivirus genera on the basis of the phylogenetic analysis of its RdRp. The smallest dsRNA, dsRNA7, seems to be a noncoding satellite RNA of BdPV1 on the basis of the conservation of its terminal sequences in BdPV1 genomic segments and its cosegregation with BdPV1 after horizontal transmission. This is the first report of a chrysovirus and a partitivirus infecting B. dothidea and of a chrysovirus associated with the hypovirulence of a phytopathogenic fungus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Liping Wang","Jingjing Jiang","Yanfen Wang","Ni Hong","Fangpeng Zhang","Wenxing Xu","Guoping Wang"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.00538-14","first_seen_on":"2014-04-25T12:25:31+00:00","issns":["1098-5514"],"journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1398428706,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24760881?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24760881","pubdate":"2014-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Hypovirulence of the phytopathogenic fungus Botryosphaeria dothidea: association with a co-infecting chrysovirus and a partitivirus.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypovirulence-phytopathogenic-fungus-botryosphaeria-dothidea-association-coinfecting-chrysovirus-par"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3691686,"mean":4.9583577239152,"rank":2953410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3691686,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94513,"mean":7.0886280049094,"rank":75098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94513,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4424,"mean":2.9949753560931,"rank":3357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4424,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":4.1373580246914,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
