There have been various studies to understand such superhydrophilic conversion. The origin of superwetting has not been clarified in a unified mechanism yet, which requires direct experimental investigation of the dynamic processes of water-layer growth. We report in situ measurements of the growth rate and height of the photo-adsorbed water layers by tip-based dynamic force microscopy. For nanocrystalline anatase and rutile TiO2 we observe light-induced enhancement of the rate and height, which decrease after O2 annealing. The results lead us to confirm that the long-range attraction between water molecules and TiO2, which is mediated by delocalized electrons in the shallow traps associated with O2 vacancies, produces photo-adsorption of water on the surface. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations clearly show that such photo-adsorbed water is critical to the zero contact angle of a water droplet spreading on it. Therefore, we conclude that this \"water wets water\" mechanism acting on the photo-adsorbed water layers is responsible for the light-induced superwetting of TiO2. Similar mechanism may be applied for better understanding of the hydrophilic conversion of doped TiO2 or other photo-catalytic oxides.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Kunyoung Lee","QHwan Kim","Sangmin An","JeongHoon An","Jongwoo Kim","Bongsu Kim","Wonho Jhe"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1319001111","first_seen_on":"2014-04-24T07:04:35+00:00","issns":["1091-6490"],"issue":"16","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1398323041,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/16\/5784.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/16\/5784.full.pdf","pmid":"24711400","pubdate":"2014-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"5784","subjects":["science"],"title":"Superwetting of TiO2 by light-induced water-layer growth via delocalized surface electrons","type":"article","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/superwetting-tio2-lightinduced-waterlayer-growth-via-delocalized-surface-electrons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4200103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123816,"mean":7.9774591769982,"rank":100713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123816,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37934,"mean":18.791180133393,"rank":36232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37934,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":964,"mean":45.089750778816,"rank":900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":964,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
