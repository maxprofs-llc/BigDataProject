This disease affects 1% to 2% of the world population and is associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality. RA experimental models have allowed a great deal of information to be translated to the corresponding human disease. This review summarizes some of the most relevant findings targeting immunomodulation in arthritis. Some general guidelines to choose an adequate experimental model and also our experience with arthritis are supplied.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fe3cf058f61000303a","authors":["Llw Ishikawa","Y Shoenfeld","A Sartori"],"doi":"10.1177\/0961203314527369","first_seen_on":"2014-04-26T23:53:28+00:00","issns":["1477-0962"],"issue":"6","journal":"Lupus","last_mentioned_on":1398556385,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24763541?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24763541","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Immunomodulation in human and experimental arthritis: including vitamin D, helminths and heat-shock proteins.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunomodulation-human-experimental-arthritis-including-vitamin-d-helminths-heatshock-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3693180,"mean":4.9616789454321,"rank":2056561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":953716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3693180,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95082,"mean":7.0840104332095,"rank":49406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95082,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":448,"mean":3.4838836689038,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":448,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.7958333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
