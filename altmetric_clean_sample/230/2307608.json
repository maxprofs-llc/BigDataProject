Though the majority intend to breastfeed, many mothers of sick, hospitalized newborns, particularly those of very low birth weight, are unable to provide a full volume of milk due to numerous physical and emotional barriers to breastfeeding. This vulnerable population of infants may benefit most from receiving breast milk nutrition and thus pasteurized donor milk should be the first consideration for supplementation when there is an inadequate supply of mother's own milk. This commentary will briefly review the history of milk banking in Canada, as well as the best available evidence for donor milk use in the very low birth weight population, including available economic analyses, with a view to advocate for its use in these vulnerable infants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000837","authors":["Julia Panczuk","Sharon Unger","Deborah O\u2019Connor","Shoo K Lee"],"doi":"10.1186\/1746-4358-9-4","first_seen_on":"2014-04-27T08:21:14+00:00","issns":["1746-4358",""],"issue":"1","journal":"International Breastfeeding Journal","last_mentioned_on":1501355447,"links":["http:\/\/www.internationalbreastfeedingjournal.com\/content\/9\/1\/4\/abstract","http:\/\/www.internationalbreastfeedingjournal.com\/content\/9\/1\/4","http:\/\/internationalbreastfeedingjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1746-4358-9-4","https:\/\/internationalbreastfeedingjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1746-4358-9-4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.internationalbreastfeedingjournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1746-4358-9-4.pdf","pmid":"24742283","pubdate":"2014-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"4","title":"Human donor milk for the vulnerable infant: a Canadian perspective","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-donor-milk-vulnerable-infant-canadian-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.1,"score_history":{"1y":6.4,"6m":6.4,"3m":6.4,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":837046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7451307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180082,"mean":7.4877581643818,"rank":21302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":158720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180082,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":8.6455567010309,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.1166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":9}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
