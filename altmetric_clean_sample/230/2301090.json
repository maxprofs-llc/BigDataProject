As the immune system is a multicompartmental system, each strain has its way to interact with it and induce a visible and quantifiable effect. This review summarizes the interplay existing between the host immune system and probiotic lactobacilli, that is, with emphasis on lactobacilli as a prototype probiotic genus. Several aspects including the bacterial-host cross-talk with the mucosal and systemic immune system are presented, as well as short sections on the competing effect towards pathogenic bacteria and their uses as delivery vehicle for antigens.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c99","authors":["Kemgang TS","Kapila S","Shanmugam VP","Kapila R","Kemgang, T.S.","Kapila, S.","Shanmugam, V.P.","Kapila, R."],"doi":"10.1111\/jam.12521","endpage":"319","first_seen_on":"2014-04-24T07:28:28+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2672","1364-5072"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Applied Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1416483795,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24738909","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jam.12521\/abstract;jsessionid=EE6DA4B63AA3A130592925D406510FC0.f04t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jam.12521\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jam.12521\/pdf","pmid":"24738909","pubdate":"2014-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"303","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Cross\u2010talk between probiotic lactobacilli and host immune system","type":"article","volume":"117","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crosstalk-between-probiotic-lactobacilli-host-immune-system-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6341020,"mean":5.9768323848265,"rank":1273280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5056995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6341020,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146658,"mean":7.6903703471367,"rank":35212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":111019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146658,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":956,"mean":4.9041465968586,"rank":223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":956,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.85,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
