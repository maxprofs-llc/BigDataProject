A method to reconstruct dose for non-coplanar VMAT beams with 3DVH is described. The Delta(4) 3D dose reconstruction on its own phantom for VMAT delivery has not been thoroughly evaluated previously, and we do so by comparison with 3DVH.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003423","authors":["Feygelman, Vladimir","Stambaugh, Cassandra","Opp, Daniel","Zhang, Geoffrey","Moros, Eduardo G.","Nelms, Benjamin E."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.radonc.2013.12.011","first_seen_on":"2014-04-27T21:19:29+00:00","issns":["0167-8140"],"journal":"Radiotherapy & Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1398633483,"links":["http:\/\/www.thegreenjournal.com\/article\/S0167-8140(13)00656-7\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=dlvr.it"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thegreenjournal.com\/article\/S0167-8140(13)00656-7\/pdf","pmid":"24440044","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Cross-validation of two commercial methods for volumetric high-resolution dose reconstruction on a phantom for non-coplanar VMAT beams","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crossvalidation-two-commercial-methods-volumetric-highresolution-dose-reconstruction-phantom-noncopl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3696818,"mean":4.9629829104368,"rank":2957510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3696818,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95757,"mean":7.0700317473578,"rank":76039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95757,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":809,"mean":1.435349009901,"rank":420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":809,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.9115384615385,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
