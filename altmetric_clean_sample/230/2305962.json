Comparative workflow studies provide quantifiable and objective metrics to determine hands-on time during specimen handling and processing, reagent preparation, return visits and maintenance, and test turnaround time and throughput. Using objective time study techniques, workflow characteristics for processing 96 and 192 tests were determined on m2000\u00ae RealTime (Abbott Molecular), Viper\u2122 XTR\u2122 (Becton Dickinson), cobas\u00ae 4800 (Roche Molecular Diagnostics), Tigris\u00ae (Hologic\u00a6Gen-Probe), and Panther\u00ae (Hologic\u00a6Gen-Probe) platforms using second generation assays for Chlamydia trachomatis-Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A combination of operational and maintenance steps requiring manual labour showed that Panther had the least overall hands-on times and Viper XTR the most. Both Panther and Tigris showed greater efficiency whether processing 96 or 192 tests. Viper XTR and Panther had the shortest times to results and m2000 RealTime the longest. Sample preparation and loading time was the shortest for Panther and longest for cobas 4800. Mandatory return visits were required only for m2000 RealTime and cobas 4800 when processing 96 tests, and both required substantially more hands-on time than the other systems due to increased numbers of return visits when processing 192 tests. These results show that there are substantial differences in the amount of labor required to operate each system. In addition to assay performance and instrumentation-reagent costs, testing capacity, workflow and maintenance characteristics should be considered in choosing a system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Ratnam S","Jang D","Gilchrist J","Smieja M","Poirier A","Hatchette T","Flandin JF","Chernesky M"],"doi":"10.1128\/jcm.03549-13","first_seen_on":"2014-04-26T02:15:43+00:00","issns":["0095-1137"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1400163356,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24740081"],"pmid":"24740081","pubdate":"2014-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Workflow and Maintenance Characteristics of Five Automated Laboratory Instruments for the Diagnosis of Sexually Transmitted Infections.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/workflow-maintenance-characteristics-five-automated-laboratory-instruments-diagnosis-sexually-transm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3554116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124727,"mean":7.9654678254737,"rank":83360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124727,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3110,"mean":3.0784618848504,"rank":2272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3110,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":3.024,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
