The enzyme biosensor was constructed with pyranose dehydrongease (PDH) from Agaricus meleagris that was immobilized on the surface of a carbon paste electrode, which contained the mediator 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP). An oxidation current of the reduced form of DCIP, DCIPH2, produced by the PDH-catalyzed reaction with either glucose or cellobiose, was recorded under constant-potential amperometry at +0.25V (vs. Ag\/AgCl). The PDH-biosensor was shown to be anomer unspecific and it can therefore be used in kinetic studies over broad time-scales of both retaining- and inverting cellulases (in addition to enzyme cocktails). The biosensor was used for real-time measurements of the activity of the inverting cellobiohydrolase Cel6A from Hypocrea jecorina (HjCel6A) on cellulosic substrates with different morphology (bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC) and Avicel). The steady-state rate of hydrolysis increased towards a saturation plateau with increasing loads of substrate. The experimental results were rationalized using a steady-state rate equation for processive cellulases, and it was found that the turnover for HjCel6A at saturating substrate concentration (i.e. maximal apparent specific activity) was similar (0.39-0.40s(-1)) for the two substrates. Conversely, the substrate load at half-saturation was much lower for BMCC compared to Avicel. Biosensors covered with a polycarbonate membrane showed high operational stability of several weeks with daily use.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f2","doi":"10.1016\/j.enzmictec.2014.03.002","first_seen_on":"2014-04-25T04:44:57+00:00","issns":["01410229"],"journal":"Enzyme & Microbial Technology","last_mentioned_on":1398401002,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0141022914000532"],"pmid":"24731827","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"A pyranose dehydrogenase-based biosensor for kinetic analysis of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose by cellulases","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pyranose-dehydrogenasebased-biosensor-kinetic-analysis-enzymatic-hydrolysis-cellulose-cellulases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2299604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1609809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107505,"mean":7.7483019980654,"rank":52912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":38387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107505,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":1.395057591623,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.39285714285714,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
