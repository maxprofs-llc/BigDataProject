The direct cytotoxic effects of oxygen\u2011glucose deprivation\/reperfusion (OGD\/R) on cardiomyocytes with and without atorvastatin pretreatment were evaluated. The effects of atorvastatin on the expression of glycogen synthase kinase\u20113\u03b2 (GSK\u20113\u03b2) and microRNA (miR)\u2011199a\u20115p were determined using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2011qPCR) and western blot analyses. In addition, the expression levels of GSK\u20113\u03b2 in cells with miR\u2011199a\u20115p upregulation and downregulation were detected using RT\u2011qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Pretreatment with atorvastatin significantly improved the recovery of cell viability from OGD\/R (P<0.05). In addition, atorvastatin pretreatment significantly increased the expression of GSK\u20113\u03b2 at the mRNA and protein levels, and the expression of miR\u2011199a\u20115p at the mRNA level (all P<0.05). The upregulation and downregulation of miR\u2011199a\u20115p respectively decreased and increased the expression of GSK\u20113\u03b2 at the mRNA and protein levels. These results suggested that atorvastatin provided cardioprotective effects against I\/R injury via increasing the expression of GSK\u20113\u03b2 through the inhibition of miR\u2011199a\u20115p.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Li, Yong ","Jiang, Ting ","Fu, Xingli ","Xu, Hao ","Ji, Jianguo "],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2017.7084","first_seen_on":"2017-08-05T00:58:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-2997","1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1501894713,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28765953?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28765953","publisher":"Spandidos Publications","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Atorvastatin protects cardiomyocytes against OGD\/R\u2011induced apoptosis by inhibiting miR\u2011199a\u20115p","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atorvastatin-protects-cardiomyocytes-against-ogdrinduced-apoptosis-inhibiting-mir199a5p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":7198021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174042,"mean":11.970340069294,"rank":142506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174042,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2150,"mean":1.7705732899023,"rank":1076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2150,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":0.65204081632653,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/893637314420678656","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23454129],"posted_on":"2017-08-05T00:58:33+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
