The optical density (OD) values were measured at 405 nm. E\/C (OD in antigen-coated wells\/OD in antigen uncoated wells) were calculated, and the values of E\/C>2 were considered positive.\nRD1 and RD9 antigen-specific antibodies were detected in sera of mice immunized with the recombinant DNA vaccine constructs (E\/C >2.0). With respect to peptide mixtures and single peptides, only PE35mixand P6 of PE35; PPE68mixand P19, P24 of PPE68 showed antibody reactivity with sera of mice immunized with the corresponding recombinant pUMVC6 and\/or pUMVC7 DNA vaccine constructs.\nThe results confirm in vivo expression and immunogenicity of all the five RD1 and RD9 genes cloned in both of the DNA vaccine vectors.","altmetric_jid":"537f30862a83eeb45a8b45d9","authors":["Hanif, ShumailaN.
