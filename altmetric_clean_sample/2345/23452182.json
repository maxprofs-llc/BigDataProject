We genotyped 397 trees representing 16 populations of E. globulus native diversity in Australia with 24 microsatellite loci. Eight genetically distinct groups were detected, consistent with genetic groupings detected in previous quantitative and molecular studies. A sample of 29 Portuguese individuals was added to help clarify the origin of the Portuguese landrace. The results suggest a southern\/eastern Tasmania origin for the Portuguese landrace. This genetic framework will enable researchers to investigate the provenance of individuals of unknown pedigree and assess the levels of representation of E. globulus natural variation in the Portuguese landrace.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c44","authors":[" Joana Costa"," Ren\u00e9 E.
