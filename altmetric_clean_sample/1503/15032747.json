In the current study, we characterized the performance of IM-CRDS relative to CVD and IRMS and investigated the mechanisms responsible for differences between the methods.\nWe collected a set of 75 soil, stem, and leaf water samples, and measured the \u03b4(18) O and \u03b4(2) H values of each sample with four techniques: CVD and IRMS, CVD and CRDS, CVD and IM-CRDS, and IM-CRDS alone. We then calculated the isotopic errors for each of the three CRDS methods relative to CVD and IRMS, and analyzed the relationships among these errors and suites of diagnostic spectral parameters that are indicative of organic contamination.\nThe IM-CRDS technique accurately assessed the \u03b4(18) O and \u03b4(2) H values of pure waters, but exhibited progressively increasing errors for soil waters, stem waters, and leaf waters. For soils, the errors were attributable to subsampling of isotopically heterogeneous source material, whereas for stems and leaves, they were attributable to spectral interference. Unexpectedly, the magnitude of spectral interference was higher for the solid samples analyzed directly via IM-CRDS than for those originally extracted via CVD and then analyzed by IM-CRDS.\nThere are many types of matrix-bound water samples for which IM-CRDS measurements include significant errors from spectral interference. As a result, spectral analysis and validation should be incorporated into IM-CRDS post-processing procedures. In the future, IM-CRDS performance could be improved through: (i) identification of the compounds that cause spectral interference, and either (ii) modification of the combustion step to completely oxidize these compounds to CO2 , and\/or (iii) incorporation of corrections for these compounds into the spectral fitting models used by the CRDS analyzers.
