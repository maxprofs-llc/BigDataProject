We systematically evaluated the EGF content of milk from 20 women delivering prematurely and from 11 women delivering at term. In preterm mothers, the concentration of EGF was 70 +\/- 5 ng\/ml (mean +\/- SEM), with no significant change during seven weeks of lactation. EGF concentration in milk of term mothers was 68 +\/- 19 ng\/ml (mean +\/- SEM). No diurnal variation in the concentration was found. Total EGF content was closely correlated with the volume of milk expressed, suggesting a passive transport from the circulation. These observations confirm that a substantial amount of EGF is present in human milk and that EGF concentrations are not affected by duration of gestation, time of day, or duration of lactation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a88","authors":["J.
