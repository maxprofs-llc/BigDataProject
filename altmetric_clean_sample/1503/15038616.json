Tablets were taken once daily.Oral iron 30 mg once daily maintained haemoglobin levels throughout pregnancy. Women whose marrows lacked demonstrable iron at the 37th week had a significantly higher incidence of megaloblastic haemopoiesis (28.7%) than those with demonstrable iron stores (15.3%); women taking oral iron did not have a lower frequency of megaloblastosis than those given a placebo. We concluded that iron does not have a direct effect on folate status in pregnancy, that the association of iron deficiency and megaloblastic anaemia in pregnancy is the result of poor nutrition, and that there is no cause-and-effect relation between them.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245c","authors":["I.
