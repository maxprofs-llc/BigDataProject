In this issue, Cannon et al. (Proteomics 2014, 14, XXXX-XXXX) use UVPD to perform top-down MS on several sequence variants of green fluorescent protein and compare the results to CID, higher energy collision induced dissociation, and electron transfer dissociation. As compared to the other techniques UVPD produces a wider variety of fragment ion types that are relatively evenly distributed across the protein sequences. Overall, their results demonstrate enhanced sequence coverage and higher confidence in sequence assignment via UVPD MS. Based on these and other recent results UVPD is certain to become an increasingly widespread and valuable tool for top-down proteomics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008649","authors":["Dang X","Young NL"],"doi":"10.1002\/pmic.201400114","first_seen_on":"2015-01-01T14:38:45+00:00","issns":["1615-9853"],"issue":"","journal":"PROTEOMICS","last_mentioned_on":1420123082,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24723542"],"pmid":"24723542","pubdate":"2014-04-12T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Ultraviolet photodissociation enhances top-down mass spectrometry as demonstrated on green fluorescent protein variants.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultraviolet-photodissociation-enhances-topdown-mass-spectrometry-demonstrated-green-fluorescent-prot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3799334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156152,"mean":8.3644933301741,"rank":122605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156152,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1555,"mean":2.0540321750322,"rank":1365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1555,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":3.1598604651163,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Physics and Astronomy":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"RU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PastelBio\/status\/550662235241336832","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3030340],"posted_on":"2015-01-01T14:38:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Pastel BioScience","url":"http:\/\/www.pastelbioscience.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1506315367\/3D_up_down_normal.png","description":"Developing revolutionary #next-gen platform #technology, InVenio, for #proteomics and protein #biomarker #discovery and #validation","id_on_source":"PastelBio","tweeter_id":"335879714","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1382},"tweet_id":"550662235241336832"}]}}
