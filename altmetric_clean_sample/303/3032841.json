The six major genotype combinations were used as grouping variables, and age, gender, BMI, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance and ln-folate, ln-vitamin B(12), or logarithmus naturalis tHcy (ln-tHcy) were used as covariates in three ANCOVA and multiple stepwise linear regression models. Hyperhomocysteinemia was present in 49.7% of the patients. The allele frequency of MTHFR 677T and 1298C was 0.319 and 0.326. MTHFR genotype and all other variables were significant predictors of ln-tHcy (higher tHcy plasma levels for MTHFR 677TT\/1298AA versus all other five genotype groups: P < 0. 05). BMI, creatinine clearance, ln-tHcy, and MTHFR genotype influenced ln-folate (lower folate levels for MTHFR 677TT\/1298AA versus all other genotype groups: P < 0.05). Creatinine clearance and ln-tHcy were the only predictors of ln-vitamin B(12) levels. In a prespecified subgroup analysis (n = 496), the MTHFR genotype also influenced tHcy levels and compound heterozygous patients had significantly lower folate levels as compared with MTHFR 677CC\/1298AA and 677CC\/1298CC. This study shows that the MTHFR 677TT\/1298AA and 677CT\/1298AC genotypes are significant predictors of tHcy and folate plasma levels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e9c","authors":["MANUELA F\u00d6DINGER","HEIDI BUCHMAYER","GOTFRIED HEINZ","MENELAOS PAPAGIANNOPOULOS","JOSEF KLETZMAYR","SUSANNE RASOUL-ROCKENSCHAUB","WALTER H.
