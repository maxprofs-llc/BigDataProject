All of the mice developed antibodies to B. burgdorferi which reached a peak indirect immunofluorescent (IFA) geometric mean antibody titer of 10 log2 21 days post-inoculation. B burgdorferi was recovered from the blood of 1 P. maniculatus 21 days post-inoculation. One uninfected Peromyscus of each species was housed in the same cage with the infected Peromyscus as a contact control. Both of the contact controls developed IFA B. burgdorferi antibodies by day 14, indicating contact infection. To determine if B. burgdorferi was being transmitted by direct contact, 5 uninfected P. leucopus and 5 uninfected P. maniculatus were caged with 3 B. burgdorferi infected P. leucopus and 3 infected P. maniculatus, respectively. Each of these contact-exposed P. leucopus and P. maniculatus developed antibodies to B. burgdorferi, and B. burgdorferi was isolated from the blood of 1 contact-exposed P. maniculatus 42 days post-initial contact. These findings show that B. burgdorferi can be transmitted by direct contact without an arthropod vector.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006990","authors":["E C Burgess","T E Amundson","J P Davis","R A Kaslow","R Edelman","Burgess, E C","Amundson, T E","Davis, J P","Kaslow, R A","Edelman, R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-03T22:39:20+00:00","issns":["0002-9637"],"issue":"2","journal":"The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1487220830,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3513648","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/3513648\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3513648"],"pmid":"3513648","pubdate":"1986-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Experimental inoculation of Peromyscus spp. with Borrelia burgdorferi: evidence of contact transmission.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/experimental-inoculation-peromyscus-spp-borrelia-burgdorferi-evidence-contact-transmission"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.1,"score_history":{"1y":3.7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8397727,"mean":7.0721511192357,"rank":661306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7734894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8397727,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241830,"mean":7.9355760475378,"rank":23167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":218592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241830,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4480,"mean":5.3706693458361,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":4288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4480,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":4.1753823529412,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":17},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":17}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
