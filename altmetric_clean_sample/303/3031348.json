In contrast, plasmablastic lymphomas are clinically aggressive neoplasms composed of immunoblastic or plasmablastic cells and associated with more mature plasma cells in some cases. Patients with plasmablastic lymphoma usually have a poor prognosis despite aggressive chemotherapy. Evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is uncommon in plasmacytoma, but common in plasmablastic lymphoma and therefore helpful in differential diagnosis. In this study, we describe 4 cases of plasmacytoma arising in immunocompetent individuals that were diffusely positive for Epstein-Barr virus encoded small RNA shown by in situ hybridization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029f1","authors":["Loghavi, Sanam","Khoury, Joseph D","Medeiros, L Jeffrey","Loghavi S","Khoury JD","Medeiros JL","Sanam Loghavi","Joseph D Khoury","L Jeffrey Medeiros"],"doi":"10.1111\/his.12640","endpage":"234","first_seen_on":"2015-01-02T06:54:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2559","0309-0167","03090167"],"issue":"2","journal":"Histopathology","last_mentioned_on":1439377206,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/his.12640\/abstract;jsessionid=386F38F4AD4309F2B8344803C0BD42EE.f01t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/his.12640\/abstract;jsessionid=E046E1449F7101B1009521DB365A6631.f02t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/his.12640\/abstract;jsessionid=71A748AC921A11A0764F8B7CE09E18F3.f04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/his.12640#.VcsnEbY33JE.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/his.12640\/pdf","pmid":"25556356","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"225","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Epstein\u2013Barr virus\u2010positive plasmacytoma in immunocompetent patients","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/his.12640","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epsteinbarr-viruspositive-plasmacytoma-immunocompetent-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8258564,"mean":6.9741565882523,"rank":3243801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4979069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8258564,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240314,"mean":7.8976751403379,"rank":73435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":165471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240314,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1670,"mean":2.6689239065309,"rank":617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1670,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":2.7945945945946,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
