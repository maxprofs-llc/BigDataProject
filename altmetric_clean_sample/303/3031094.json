The chemokine CCL2, which plays a pivotal role in the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the nervous system, is one of only a few chemokines produced by neurons. We hypothesized that morphine may alter expression of CCL2 by human neurons.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000085d","authors":["Rock RB","Hu S","Sheng WS","Peterson PK"],"doi":"10.1186\/1742-2094-3-32","first_seen_on":"2015-01-02T00:35:29+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Neuroinflammation","last_mentioned_on":1420158895,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17156455"],"pmcid":"PMC1712222","pmid":"17156455","pubdate":"2006-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Morphine stimulates CCL2 production by human neurons.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/morphine-stimulates-ccl2-production-human-neurons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4751962,"mean":5.7092625027899,"rank":3977540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4751962,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164829,"mean":8.2907145387922,"rank":131287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164829,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":726,"mean":3.6468551724138,"rank":628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":726,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.796875,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
