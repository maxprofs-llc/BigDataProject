In the short-term model, we divided female Sprague-Dawley rats (3 weeks old) into six groups, according to treatment: vehicle, HT042 (100 mg\/kg), Phlomis umbrosa (100 mg\/kg), Astragalus membranaceus (100 mg\/kg), and Eleutherococcus senticosus (100 mg\/kg) were administered twice daily, and recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) (1 IU) was subcutaneously injected once daily. Treatments were maintained for 4 days in each case. On day 3, tetracycline (20 mg\/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (20 mg\/kg) to form the fluorescent band on the growth plates. On days 2-4, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (50 mg\/kg) was injected intraperitoneally to label proliferating cells. On day 5, the tibias were dissected and fixed in 30% sucrose. Dehydrated bone was sectioned at a thickness of 40 \u03bcm and observed. The bone growth in groups administered HT042 and rhGH was significantly increased to 433.50 \u00b1 21.61 and 434.49 \u00b1 15.21 \u03bcm\/day, respectively, from 410.03 \u00b1 17.4 \u03bcm\/day (control). The height of the growth plates in the HT042 and rhGH groups was also significantly increased to 556.5 \u00b1 21.1 and 544.2 \u00b1 21.1 \u03bcm (P <\u2009.05), respectively, from 518.1 \u00b1 4.1 \u03bcm (normal). The number of BrdU-positive cells in chondrocytes of the HT042 and rhGH groups was increased to 389 \u00b1 36 and 627 \u00b1 39 cells\/mm\u00b2 (P <\u2009.001), respectively, from 264 \u00b1 17 cells\/mm\u00b2 (control). Insulin-like growth factor-1 and bone morphogenetic protein-2 in the HT042 group were highly expressed in the growth plate. In the long-term rat model, the body weight, nose-tail length, and nose-anus length were measured by microknemometry for 4 weeks. The body weight of the rhGH group was significantly increased. The nose-anus length of the HT042 and rhGH groups was significantly greater at 18.5 \u00b1 0.3 and 18.7 \u00b1 0.3 cm compared to 18.2 \u00b1 0.2 cm (control).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e48","authors":["Kim MY","Park Y","Pandit NR","Kim J","Song M","Park J","Choi HY","Kim H"],"doi":"10.1089\/jmf.2010.1007","first_seen_on":"2015-01-04T22:09:16+00:00","issns":["1096-620X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Food","last_mentioned_on":1420351428,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21091251"],"pmid":"21091251","pubdate":"2010-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["medicine","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"The herbal formula HT042 induces longitudinal bone growth in adolescent female rats.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/herbal-formula-ht042-induces-longitudinal-bone-growth-adolescent-female-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":2412024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1665706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155997,"mean":8.3796822098004,"rank":79462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":57910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155997,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":639,"mean":5.7691191222571,"rank":313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":639,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.3309523809524,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"googleplus":[{"title":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21091251","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/108311323660188933426\/posts\/Vg4wQDuLa17","citation_ids":[3035831],"posted_on":"2015-01-04T06:03:48+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21091251 http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21091251\ufeff The herbal formula HT042 induces longitudinal bone growth in adoles... - PubMed - NCBI J Med Food. 2010 Dec;13(6):1376-84. doi: 10.1089\/jmf.2010.1007.
