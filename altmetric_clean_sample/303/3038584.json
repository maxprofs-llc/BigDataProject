An anonymous online survey was sent to all 64 pediatric program directors (PD) of PBMT centers in the United States, which are accredited by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT). The overall response rate was 56% (CI: 44-68%); variations in clinical practices were noted regarding (i) surveillance for late onset cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and (ii) pharmacokinetic\/therapeutic drug monitoring of antimicrobials. Prospective studies among PBMT recipients to address infectious complications among this population and variations in clinical practice may be required.
