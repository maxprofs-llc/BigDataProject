Fears of being overwhelmed, merged, penetrated, fragmented, and destroyed, as contents of unconscious and conscious fantasies, are regularly interrelated with the typical dangers. Fifteen preliminary propositions invite closer study of such apprehensions and provide definitional components. Annihilation anxieties are triggered by survival threat; are found early but can be engendered throughout the life cycle; constitute a basic danger; are residuals of psychic trauma; have specifiable subdimensions; may occur in presymbolic form or be associated with fantasies in conflict\/compromise formation; may arise with or without anticipation; may be accompanied by controlled or uncontrolled anxiety; are motives for defense; and may be associated with particularly recalcitrant resistances. The study of annihilation anxieties in relation to the basic danger series has both theoretical and clinical advantages, especially for understanding traumatic, anxiety, phobic, psychosomatic, addictive, narcissistic, borderline, and psychotic manifestations, as well as sexual problems (including perversions), nightmares, dissociative and panic states, and especially difficult resistances.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e98","authors":["Marvin Hurvich","Hurvich, Marvin"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-03T23:44:14+00:00","issns":["0003-0651"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association","last_mentioned_on":1476904852,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12866758","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12866758"],"pmid":"12866758","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"The place of annihilation anxieties in psychoanalytic theory.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/place-annihilation-anxieties-psychoanalytic-theory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7560115,"mean":6.5270342886323,"rank":3687758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3680754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7560115,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234700,"mean":7.698836211488,"rank":105231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":120065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234700,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258,"mean":2.6077354085603,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.65,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
