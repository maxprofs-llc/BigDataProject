Our studies investigated characteristics of male and female perpetrators and victims of peer sexual coercion, focusing on self-esteem, sexist attitudes, and involvement in nonsexual deviant behaviors, such as drugs and alcohol. The participants, all of whom were in Grades 8 to 11, were from Quebec, Canada. They completed self-report measures. Female victims had lower self-esteem and more sexist attitudes than other female participants, whereas male perpetrators had more sexist attitudes than other male participants. Furthermore, all victims and perpetrators were more likely to be involved in other types of nonsexual deviance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f5","authors":["Lacasse A","Mendelson MJ"],"doi":"10.1177\/0886260506297027","endpage":"437","first_seen_on":"2015-01-06T06:33:01+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0886-2605"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Interpersonal Violence","last_mentioned_on":1420585080,"links":["http:\/\/jiv.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/4\/424.long"],"pmid":"17369445","pubdate":"2007-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Criminology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"424","subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"Sexual coercion among adolescents: victims and perpetrators.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexual-coercion-among-adolescents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.248,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.248},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5067960,"mean":6.0030195500818,"rank":314034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4753891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5067960,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179150,"mean":8.2752469955178,"rank":15232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":163917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179150,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1159,"mean":4.2640069084629,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1159,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":3.5770967741935,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
