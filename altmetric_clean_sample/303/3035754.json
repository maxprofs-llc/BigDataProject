It is known from this special form of the molecule that it has an increased level of fluorescence emission when excited at 488 nm after irradiation at lambda approximately 413 nm, under single-photon excitation conditions. Here, we show that upon two-photon irradiation, PA-GFP yields activation in the spectral region from 720 to 840 nm. After photoactivation, the excitation spectrum shifts maintaining the very same emission spectrum of the single-photon case for the native and photoactivated protein. Additionally, when comparing the conventional photoactivation at lambda = 405 nm with a two-photon one, a sharper and better controllable three-dimensional volume of activation is obtained.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2005BpJ....89.1346S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","doi":"10.1529\/biophysj.104.054502","first_seen_on":"2015-01-04T20:25:04+00:00","issns":["0006-3495"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1420403076,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fbiophysj%2Fabstract%2FS0006-3495%252805%252972782-X&code=cell-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S000634950572782X\/pdf","pmid":"15908572","pubdate":"2005-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1346","subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Two-Photon Activation and Excitation Properties of PA-GFP in the 720\u2013920-nm Region","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/twophoton-activation-excitation-properties-pagfp-720920nm-region"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4692692,"mean":5.4309072116255,"rank":2412684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1665075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4692692,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156009,"mean":8.3835427670377,"rank":79512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":57861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156009,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2147,"mean":2.777863000932,"rank":969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2147,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":9.3087755102041,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":36,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
