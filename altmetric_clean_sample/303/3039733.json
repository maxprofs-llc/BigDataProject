These necessary components play a significant physiological role which includes regulation of the electrical and mechanical action of the heart. Abnormal concentration of the above-mentioned ions, i.e. water-electrolyte imbalance, may result in cardiac arrhythmias, muscle contraction disorders, disturbances of neuronal activity and influences the drugs activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d132","authors":["Kamila Fijorek","Miroslawa Puskulluoglu","Dorota Tomaszewska","Roman Tomaszewski","Anna Glinka","Sebastian Polak"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-06T11:06:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0015-5616"],"issue":"1","journal":"Folia medica Cracoviensia","last_mentioned_on":1432980156,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25556366?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25556366","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Serum potassium, sodium and calcium levels in healthy individuals - literature review and data analysis.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-potassium-sodium-calcium-levels-healthy-individuals-literature-review-data-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5165331,"mean":6.0999753905388,"rank":4294640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5165331,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181534,"mean":8.2851202921784,"rank":144230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181534,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.91842105263158,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.72857142857143,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
