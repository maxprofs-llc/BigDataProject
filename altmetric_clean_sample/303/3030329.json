Prodigiosin has antimicrobial, antimalarial and antitumor properties and induces apoptosis in T and B lymphocytes. These properties have piqued the interest of researchers in the fields of medicine, pharmaceutics and different industries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin against pathogenic micro-organisms. The red pigments produced by S. marcescens exhibited absorption at 534\u00a0nm, Rf of 0.59 and molecular weight of 323\u00a0m\/z. Antimicrobial activity was tested against oxacillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Acinetobacter sp. and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. The standard antibiotics employed were ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and oxacillin. The disc-diffusion tests demonstrated significant inhibition zones for S. aureus (35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6), E. faecalis (22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0) and S. pyogenes (14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6). However, prodigiosin showed resistance to E. coli, P. aeruginosa and acinetobacter, where no significant formation of inhibitory halos were observed. We determined the inhibitory minimum concentrations and bactericidal for 20 strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA). The pattern was the antibiotic oxacillin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations observed ranged from 1, 2 and 4.0\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL, respectively, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2, 4, 8 and 16\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL. The S. marcescens prodigiosin produced by showed bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect showing promising antimicrobial activity and suggesting future studies regarding its applicability in antibiotics therapies directed ORSA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003740","authors":["J C Lapenda","P A Silva","M C Vicalvi","K X F R Sena","S C Nascimento"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11274-014-1793-y","first_seen_on":"2015-01-01T14:35:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-0972"],"journal":"World Journal of Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1420121853,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25549906?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25549906","pubdate":"2014-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Engineering\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Antimicrobial activity of prodigiosin isolated from Serratia marcescens UFPEDA 398.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antimicrobial-activity-prodigiosin-isolated-serratia-marcescens-ufpeda-398"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":2412024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1665579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156151,"mean":8.3645404931157,"rank":79460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":58056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156151,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":326,"mean":1.3342769230769,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":326,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.4117647058824,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
