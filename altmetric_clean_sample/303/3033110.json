There are limited reports on cellular origin and prognostic factors. We retrospectively investigated 73 cases with a median age of 54 years and a male-female ratio of 2.0:1. The upper aerodigestive tract (nasal group) was the most common site of involvement (51 cases; 70%). The other organs (n = 22; extranasal group) included the skin (12 cases; 16%) and gastrointestinal tract (5; 7%). Of the 70 cases with complete staging, 71% had stage I\/II disease. All cases were positive for Epstein-Barr virus by in situ hybridization. Using immunohistochemistry and clonality assay for T-cell receptor gene rearrangement, these tumors were classified into NK (n = 39; 53%), T (n = 13; 18%), and indeterminate lineage (n = 21; 29%). The only clinicopathological difference among these 3 groups was rare CD5 expression in the NK-cell group. Nasal tumors were more frequently of NK-cell origin, and extranasal tumors were equally of either T- or NK-cell origin. The 5-year overall survival rate was 35.6%. The overall survival time was shorter in the extranasal group, although there was no statistical difference in age, sex, and histologic or immunophenotypic features between the 2 groups. Excluding the cases with indeterminate lineage, 75% of cases were of NK lineage; and 25%, T lineage. Extranasal tumors were more aggressive than their nasal counterparts. A prospective national study is warranted for a better understanding of the clinicopathological and genetic features of this uncommon tumor and the prognostic factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007680","authors":["Jie-Yang Jhuang","Sheng-Tsung Chang","Shih-Feng Weng","Shien-Tung Pan","Pei-Yi Chu","Pin-Pen Hsieh","Chih-Hsin Wei","Shih-Cheng Chou","Chiew-Loon Koo","Chih-Jung Chen","Jeng-Dong Hsu","Shih-Sung Chuang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.humpath.2014.11.008","first_seen_on":"2015-01-03T22:39:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8392"],"journal":"Human Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1426949405,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25554090?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25554090?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25554090","pubdate":"2014-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Extranodal natural killer\/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type in Taiwan: a relatively higher frequency of T-cell lineage and poor survival for extranasal tumors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extranodal-natural-killertcell-lymphoma-nasal-type-taiwan-relatively-higher-frequency-tcell-lineage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4897807,"mean":5.8216879933617,"rank":2255932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2517808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4897807,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172685,"mean":8.168989668991,"rank":72201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":94963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172685,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":876,"mean":1.948064,"rank":332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":876,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.6090909090909,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
