To investigate possible functional complementarity within the IRS family, we generated mice with double knockout of the genes for IRS-1\/IRS-3 and IRS-1\/IRS-4. Mice with a combined deficiency of IRS-1 and IRS-4 showed no differences from Irs1(-\/-) mice with respect to growth and glucose homeostasis. In contrast, mice with a combined deficiency of IRS-1 and IRS-3 developed early-onset severe lipoatrophy associated with marked hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance. However, in contrast to other models of lipoatrophic diabetes, there was no accumulation of fat in liver or muscle. Furthermore, plasma leptin levels were markedly decreased, and adenovirus-mediated expression of leptin in liver reversed the hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. The results indicate that IRS-1 and IRS-3 play important complementary roles in adipogenesis and establish the Irs1(-\/-)\/Irs3(-\/-) double knockout mouse as a novel model of lipoatrophic diabetes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["Palle G.
