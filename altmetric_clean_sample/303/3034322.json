Investigations along 797\u00a0km stretch of Ganga River indicated that TEP declined with increasing N:P stoichiometric ratio downstream. The TEP showed positive relationship with chlorophyll a (R(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.9661; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and biogenic silica (R(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.8797; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and negative relationship (R(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.8547; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) with N:P ratio. The study that forms the first report on N:P linked changes in TEP in Ganga River showed that the shifting N:P stoichiometric ratios resulting from anthropogenic release may alter TEP production and, by implication, ecosystem functioning including carbon sequestration in the river.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649f","authors":["Usha Pandey","Jitendra Pandey"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00128-014-1344-0","first_seen_on":"2015-01-04T00:21:16+00:00","issns":["1432-0800","0007-4861"],"journal":"Bulletin of Environmental Contamination & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1420220893,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00128-014-1344-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00128-014-1344-0.pdf","pmid":"25106773","pubdate":"2014-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pollution, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Soil Science & Conservation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"The Skewed N:P Stoichiometry Resulting from Anthropogenic Drivers Regulate Production of Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) in Ganga River","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/skewed-np-stoichiometry-resulting-anthropogenic-drivers-regulate-production-transparent-exopolymer-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6278272,"mean":5.9867156995941,"rank":2928814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3325326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6278272,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194268,"mean":8.1344582970861,"rank":96052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":97137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194268,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":779,"mean":1.678616966581,"rank":227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":779,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":0.96185714285714,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
