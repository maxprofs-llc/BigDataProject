Tumor dormant cells may appear in early stages of tumor development, as well as in micrometastasis and minimal residual disease. The mechanism for the switch of dormant cells between quiescent and proliferative stages is still largely unknown. Potential mechanisms that may account for the transition between dormant tumor cells and proliferative cells include angiogenesis, immune response, cellular factors, and signaling pathways. The clinical and therapeutic importance of dormant cells requires further studies to provide therapeutic strategies for inhibition of metastasis and tumor recurrence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e12","authors":["Jie Li","Enze Jiang","Xinxing Wang","Anna Junjie Shangguan","Luo Zhang","Zhenghong Yu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12013-014-0477-4","first_seen_on":"2015-01-05T17:33:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-0283","1085-9195"],"journal":"Cell Biochemistry and Biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1420478532,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12013-014-0477-4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12013-014-0477-4.pdf","pmid":"25556072","pubdate":"2015-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biophysics and Biological Physics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Dormant Cells: The Original Cause of Tumor Recurrence and Metastasis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dormant-cells-original-cause-tumor-recurrence-metastasis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4697597,"mean":5.4371715448403,"rank":3807565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":144860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4697597,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156130,"mean":8.4425648406127,"rank":122926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156130,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":514,"mean":1.0257348927875,"rank":242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":514,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":0.67051282051282,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
