We recently identified five novel residues critical for RdRP activity (Qin, W., Yamashita, T., Shirota, Y., Lin, Y., Wei, W., and Murakami, S. (2001) Hepatology 33, 728-737). Among them, GLU-18 and His-502, far from the catalytic center, may be involved in conformational change(s) for RdRP activity as addressed in some palm and fingers enzymes. We examined the possibility that NS5B is oligomerized, and we could detect the interaction between two different tagged NS5B proteins in vitro and transiently expressed in mammalian cells. By scanning 27 clustered and then point alanine substitutions in vivo and in vitro, Glu-18 and His-502 were found to be critical for the homomeric interaction in vivo and in vitro, strongly suggesting a close relationship between the oligomerization and RdRP activity of NS5B. All mutants with substitutions at these two residues failed to bind wild type NS5B, however E18H interacted with H502E in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the NS5B protein with E18H or H502E did not exhibit RdRP activity, but a mixture of the two mutant proteins did. These results clearly indicate that two residues of HCV NS5B are critical for the oligomerization that is prerequisite to RdRP activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Weiping Qin","Hong Luo","Takahiro Nomura","Naoyuki Hayashi","Tatsuya Yamashita","Seishi Murakami"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m106880200","first_seen_on":"2015-01-02T12:12:20+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1420287128,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M106880200","http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/277\/3\/2132"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/277\/3\/2132.full.pdf","pmid":"11673460","pubdate":"2002-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Oligomeric Interaction of Hepatitis C Virus NS5B Is Critical for Catalytic Activity of RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase","type":"article","volume":"277","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oligomeric-interaction-hepatitis-c-virus-ns5b-critical-catalytic-activity-rnadependent-rna-polymeras"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085955,"mean":6.867536808883,"rank":4273353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2246444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085955,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238745,"mean":7.8564478939786,"rank":118828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":93564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238745,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30861,"mean":3.252082242385,"rank":21870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":4762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30861,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":373,"mean":3.9230967741935,"rank":157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":373,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
