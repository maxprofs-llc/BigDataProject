Eels do not feed during this journey and on-board fuels must be sufficient to support the journey of 3.5 to 6 month, as well as sexual maturation and the spawning activity. Swimming of eels appears to be quite energy efficient compared to other fish species, and elevated hydrostatic pressure has been shown to even reduce the costs of transport. Recent studies revealed, however, that during traveling eels perform extensive diurnal migrations and swim at a depth of about 100-300 m at night time, but go down to 600-1000 m at day time. At a depth of 200 m eels are exposed to a hydrostatic pressure of 21 atmospheres (2.13 MPa), while at 800 m hydrostatic pressure increases to 81 atmospheres (8.21 MPa). Accordingly, without any compensation at a depth of 800 m swimbladder volume will be reduced to about 25% of the volume established with neutral buoyancy at 200 m. Consequently, these diurnal changes in depth must be taken into consideration for a calculation of the energy requirements of the spawning migration. Without compensation a compression of the swimbladder will result in a status of negative buoyancy, which makes swimming more costly. Trying to keep the status of neutral buoyancy during descent by gas secretion into the swimbladder in turn requires metabolic activity to enhance swimbladder perfusion and for acid production of the gas gland cells to stimulate gas secretion. During ascent gas is passively removed from the swimbladder in the resorbing section and in the blood transported to the gills, where it is lost into the water. Accordingly, the swimbladder appears to be a crucial organ for the spawning migration. It can be assumed that an impairment of swimbladder function for example due to an infection with the nematode Anguillicola crassus significantly threatens the success of the spawning migration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc19","authors":["Pelster, Bernd"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphys.2014.00486","first_seen_on":"2015-01-05T15:28:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-042X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1424183346,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fphys.2014.00486\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25646080?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphys.2014.00486\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fphys.2014.00486\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4297919","pmid":"25646080","pubdate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Swimbladder function and the spawning migration of the European eel Anguilla anguilla","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/swimbladder-function-spawning-migration-european-eel-anguilla-anguilla-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7859354,"mean":6.6569164843412,"rank":3199689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4617395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7859354,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236416,"mean":7.8043147939006,"rank":78021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":156597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236416,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2660,"mean":5.2668732606243,"rank":693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2660,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":3.3762123893805,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
