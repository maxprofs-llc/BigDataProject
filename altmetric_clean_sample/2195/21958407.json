The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the Ilizarov external fixator in the management of proximal humeral fractures.\nBetween May 2011 and December 2013, 14 patients with displaced proximal humeral fractures were enrolled in the current study. Nine patients were males and five were females, with mean age 42.9\u00a0years (range 21-55). All fractures were acute. The mode of injury was road traffic accident in eight patients and fall in six patients. There were six patients with two-part fracture, one of them with fracture dislocation, and eight patients presented with three-part fracture, two of them with fracture dislocation. All fractures were fixed using the Ilizarov external fixation.\nThe average operative time was about 67\u00a0min (range 50-90). The mean follow-up period was (18) months (range 12-28). Healing was obtained in all 14 patients in a mean of 10.4\u00a0weeks (range 8-14). At the final follow-up, the mean constant score was 73.1 points (range 60-97 points), the mean visual analog score (VAS) for pain 3.2 (range 1-5), the mean DASH score 31.8 points (range 10-55 points), and the mean satisfaction VAS 7.6 (range 4-10).\nThe Ilizarov external fixation is an effective technique in managing proximal humeral fractures with good outcome and low complication rates.\nLevel IV, case series.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000230b","authors":["Meselhy, Mohammed Anter","Singer, Mohamed Salah"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00402-017-2749-0","first_seen_on":"2017-07-16T10:04:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0936-8051","1434-3916"],"journal":"Archives of Orthopaedic & Trauma Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1500199455,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28710670?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28710670","pubdate":"2017-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Management of proximal humeral fractures by the Ilizarov external fixator","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-proximal-humeral-fractures-ilizarov-external-fixator"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219190,"mean":6.9624096623095,"rank":7112915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219190,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179253,"mean":11.435776437641,"rank":146255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179253,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":405,"mean":3.3625396039604,"rank":337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":405,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.02,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/painmanwise\/statuses\/886526885953458176","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21958407],"posted_on":"2017-07-16T10:04:15+00:00","author":{"name":"painmanwise","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514094062056390656\/ORtXawZi_normal.png","id_on_source":"painmanwise","tweeter_id":"2826634074","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":131},"tweet_id":"886526885953458176"}]}}
