Here, the use of SMFC resulted in 92% benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) removal over 970 days relative to 54% in the controls. Sediment functions, microbial community structure and network interactions were dramatically altered by the SMFC employment. Functional gene analysis showed that c-type cytochromes genes for electron transfer, aromatic degradation genes and extracellular ligninolytic enzymes involved in lignin degradation were significantly enriched in bulk sediments during SMFC operation. Correspondingly, chemical analysis of the system showed that these genetic changes resulted in increases in the levels of easily oxidizable organic carbon and humic acids which may have resulted in increased BaP bioavailability and increased degradation rates. Tracking microbial functional genes and corresponding organic matter responses should aid mechanistic understanding of BaP enhanced biodegradation by microbial electrochemistry and development of sustainable bioremediation strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Zaisheng Yan","Yuhong He","Haiyuan Cai","Joy D.
