Likewise, the existence of NATs has been observed in Plasmodium but our understanding towards their genome-wide distribution remains incomplete due to the limited depth and uncertainties in the level of strand specificity of previous datasets.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-15-150","first_seen_on":"2014-02-22T05:24:27+00:00","issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1393238042,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/15\/150\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-15-150.pdf","pmid":"24559473","pubdate":"2014-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"150","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Strand-specific RNA-Seq reveals widespread and developmentally regulated transcription of natural antisense transcripts in Plasmodium falciparum","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strandspecific-rnaseq-reveals-widespread-developmentally-regulated-transcription-natural-antisense-t-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":2971093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1399744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111100,"mean":8.3774205348385,"rank":74764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":33726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111100,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113,"mean":3.328923151751,"rank":2846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231,"mean":3.0518434782609,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
