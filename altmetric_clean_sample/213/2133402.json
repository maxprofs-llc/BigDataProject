Therefore, from an analytical point of view, knowledge of the mass spectrometric properties of noscapine and its derivatives is essential. The goal of the present study is to describe the collision-induced dissociation behavior of noscapine and its seven derivatives ionized by protons and lithium and sodium ions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086ec","authors":["Nagy, Lajos","Kuki, \u00c1kos","Szab\u00f3, Katalin","Sipos, Attila","Zsuga, Mikl\u00f3s","K\u00e9ki, S\u00e1ndor"],"doi":"10.1002\/rcm.6847","endpage":"828","first_seen_on":"2014-02-20T15:04:39+00:00","issns":["1097-0231","0951-4198"],"issue":"7","journal":"Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","last_mentioned_on":1392908654,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.6847\/abstract;jsessionid=FCD0A3C1D5285C3832506D63BCA4E0B0.f01t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.6847\/pdf","pmid":"24573814","pubdate":"2014-02-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"822","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Fragmentation study of noscapine derivatives under electrospray conditions","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fragmentation-study-noscapine-derivatives-under-electrospray-conditions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6247300,"mean":5.9913331979167,"rank":5310692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6247300,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137256,"mean":8.6502440129687,"rank":112769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137256,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":620,"mean":1.9099450726979,"rank":366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":620,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.45652173913043,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
