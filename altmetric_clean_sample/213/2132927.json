Recent research demonstrated that SIRT1 pre-mRNA undergoes alternative splicing to produce different isoforms, such as SIRT1 full-length and SIRT1-\u2206Exon8 variants. Previous studies revealed these SIRT1 mRNA splice variants convey different characteristics and functions to the protein, which may in turn explain the multifunctional roles of SIRT1. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of SIRT1 alternative splicing remain to be elucidated. Our objective is to search for new pathways that regulate of SIRT1 alternative splicing. Here we describe experiments showing that HuR and TIA1\/TIAL1, two kinds of RNA-binding proteins, were involved in the regulation of alternative splicing of SIRT1 pre-mRNA under normal and stress circumstances: HuR increased SIRT1-\u2206Exon8 by promoting SIRT1 exon 8 exclusion, whereas TIA1\/TIAL1 inhibition of the exon 8 exclusion led to a decrease in SIRT1-\u2206Exon8 mRNA levels. This study provides novel insight into how the alternative splicing of SIRT1 pre-mRNA is regulated, which has fundamental implications for understanding the critical and multifunctional roles of SIRT1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Wenhui Zhao"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms15022946","first_seen_on":"2014-02-20T10:24:37+00:00","issns":["1422-0067",""],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1392891846,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/15\/2\/2946"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/15\/2\/2946\/pdf","pmid":"24566137","pubdate":"2014-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"HuR and TIA1\/TIAL1 Are Involved in Regulation of Alternative Splicing of SIRT1 Pre-mRNA","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hur-tia1tial1-involved-regulation-alternative-splicing-sirt1-premrna"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4282690,"mean":5.0215424405332,"rank":3398007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4282690,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109083,"mean":8.1854830494492,"rank":86625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109083,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1836,"mean":1.5662822888283,"rank":1043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":0.68088235294118,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
