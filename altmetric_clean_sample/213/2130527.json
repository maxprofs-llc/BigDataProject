We conducted a large genetic study in trauma-exposed European-American women (N=2538; 845 PTSD cases, 1693 controls) by testing 3742 SNPs across more than 300 genes and conducting polygenic analyses using results from the Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Studies Consortium (PGC). We tested the association between each SNP and two measures of PTSD, a severity score and diagnosis. We found a significant association between PTSD (diagnosis) and SNPs (top SNP: rs363276, odds ratio (OR)=1.4, p=2.1E-05) in SLC18A2 (vesicular monoamine transporter 2). A haplotype analysis of 9 SNPs in SLC18A2, including rs363276, identified a risk haplotype (CGGCGGAAG, p=0.0046), and the same risk haplotype was associated with PTSD in an independent cohort of trauma-exposed African-Americans (p=0.049; N=748, men and women). SLC18A2 is involved in transporting monoamines to synaptic vesicles and has been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including major depression. Eight genes previously associated with PTSD had SNPs with nominally significant associations (p<0.05). The polygenic analyses suggested that there are SNPs in common between PTSD severity and bipolar disorder. Our data are consistent with a genetic architecture for PTSD that is highly polygenic, influenced by numerous SNPs with weak effects, and may overlap with mood disorders. Genome-wide studies with very large samples sizes are needed to detect these types of effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a7","authors":["Nadia Solovieff","Andrea L Roberts","Andrew Ratanatharathorn","Michelle Haloosim","Immaculata De Vivo","Anthony P King","Israel Liberzon","Allison Aiello","Monica Uddin","Derek E Wildman","Sandro Galea","Jordan W Smoller","Shaun M Purcell","Karestan C Koenen"],"doi":"10.1038\/npp.2014.34","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2014-02-19T12:52:27+00:00","issns":["0893-133X","1740-634X"],"journal":"Neuropsychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1394196305,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/npp\/journal\/vaop\/naam\/abs\/npp201434a.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24525708?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24525708?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24525708"],"pmid":"24525708","pubdate":"2014-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["psychopharmacology","neurology"],"title":"Genetic Association Analysis of 300 Genes Identifies a Risk Haplotype in SLC18A2 for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in two Independent Samples","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-association-analysis-300-genes-identifies-risk-haplotype-slc18a2-posttraumatic-stress-disord"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5899230,"mean":6.1145522897933,"rank":1252302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":4637504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5899230,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136199,"mean":8.681428552549,"rank":34976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":100827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136199,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2825,"mean":8.6179567988669,"rank":1140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":1676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2825,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":14.055051282051,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
