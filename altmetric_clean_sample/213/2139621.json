When a fixed implant-supported restoration is planned for the restoration of completely edentulous patients, it is important to recognize the esthetic performance of the prosthesis in the initial stages. Bone resorbtion may result in an unfavorable interarch relationship, and soft tissue support may be needed. A detailed presurgical evaluation (including tooth setup, construction of radiological and surgical guide) is needed to ensure the placement of implants in prosthetically favored positions. In this paper, a technique is presented where a detailed wax-up of the restoration is accomplished on provisional implant abutments and tried on the patient after implant placement. This setup may offer valuable information on the expected lip support and the need of gingiva-colored ceramic. In this way, the esthetic result can be evaluated at early stages before any irreversible laboratory stages are performed and needed corrections can be done accordingly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000caa","authors":["Kourtis, Stefanos","Kokkinos, Kyriakos","Roussou, Vasiliki"],"doi":"10.1111\/jerd.12082","endpage":"47","first_seen_on":"2014-02-23T15:37:41+00:00","issns":["1708-8240","1496-4155"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1393169853,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jerd.12082\/pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jerd.12082\/pdf","pmid":"24341687","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"40","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Predicting the Final Result in Implant\u2010Supported Fixed Restorations for Completely Edentulous Patients","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predicting-final-result-implantsupported-fixed-restorations-completely-edentulous-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6692642,"mean":6.1590254522819,"rank":3207436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1989016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6692642,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170272,"mean":7.5507504037684,"rank":79923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":70412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170272,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":25.261891891892,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
