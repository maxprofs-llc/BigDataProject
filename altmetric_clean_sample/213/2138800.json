In this study, dietary EPA was converted to 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-EpETE) by \u03c9-3 epoxygenation in the mouse peritoneal cavity. Mediator lipidomics revealed a series of novel oxygenated metabolites of 17,18-EpETE, and one of the major metabolites, 12-hydroxy-17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-OH-17,18-EpETE), displayed a potent anti-inflammatory action by limiting neutrophil infiltration in murine zymosan-induced peritonitis. 12-OH-17,18-EpETE inhibited leukotriene B4-induced neutrophil chemotaxis and polarization in vitro in a low nanomolar range (EC50 0.6 nM). The complete structures of two natural isomers were assigned as 12S-OH-17R,18S-EpETE and 12S-OH-17S,18R-EpETE, using chemically synthesized stereoisomers. These natural isomers displayed potent anti-inflammatory action, whereas the unnatural stereoisomers were essentially devoid of activity. These results demonstrate that 17,18-EpETE derived from dietary EPA is converted to a potent bioactive metabolite 12-OH-17,18-EpETE, which may generate an endogenous anti-inflammatory metabolic pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b3","authors":["Kubota T","Arita M","Isobe Y","Iwamoto R","Goto T","Yoshioka T","Urabe D","Inoue M","Arai H"],"doi":"10.1096\/fj.13-236224","first_seen_on":"2014-02-22T20:01:49+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["1530-6860"],"issue":"2","journal":"FASEB Journal","last_mentioned_on":1407158501,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24128889","http:\/\/www.fasebj.org\/content\/28\/2\/586.short"],"pmid":"24128889","pubdate":"2013-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"FASEB","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","physiology"],"title":"Eicosapentaenoic acid is converted via \u03c9-3 epoxygenation to the anti-inflammatory metabolite 12-hydroxy-17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/eicosapentaenoic-acid-converted-via-3-epoxygenation-antiinflammatory-metabolite-12hydroxy1718epoxyei"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7443716,"mean":6.4694361852875,"rank":3358948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4055244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7443716,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174293,"mean":7.7131981043309,"rank":68026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":105297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174293,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2606,"mean":10.198804606526,"rank":1394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2606,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":24.192829268293,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
