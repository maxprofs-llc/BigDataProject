Our results indicate that S4 traverses the membrane with no more than 5 amino acids in the closed state, and that the distribution of buried residues changes when channels open. This change argues for a displacement of S4 through the plane of the membrane in which an initially intracellular residue moves to within 3 amino acids of the extracellular solution. These results demonstrate that the putative voltage-sensing charges of S4 actually reside in the membrane and that they move outward when channels open. We consider constraints placed on channel structure by these results.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Larsson, H P","Baker, O S","Dhillon, D S","Isacoff, E Y","H.Peter Larsson","Oliver S.
