Here, we describe a new, potent vaccine vector based on replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with the glycoprotein of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (VSV-GP), which we previously showed to be safe in mice. In mice, VSV and VSV-GP encoding ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen (VSV-OVA and VSV-GP-OVA) induced equal levels of OVA-specific humoral and cellular immune responses upon a single immunization. However, boosting with the same vector was possible only for VSV-GP-OVA as neutralizing antibodies to VSV limited the immunogenicity of the VSV-OVA boost. OVA-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses induced by VSV-GP-OVA were at least as potent as those induced by an adenoviral state-of-the-art vaccine vector and completely protected mice in a Listeria monocytogenes challenge model. VSV-GP is so far the only replication-competent vaccine vector that does not lose efficacy upon repeated application.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Reinhard Tober","Zoltan Banki","Lisa Egerer","Alexander Muik","Sandra Behm\u00fcller","Florian Kreppel","Ute Greczmiel","Annette Oxenius","Dorothee von Laer","Janine Kimpel"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.03276-13","first_seen_on":"2014-02-21T10:11:26+00:00","issns":["1098-5514"],"journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1392977460,"links":["http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/early\/2014\/02\/13\/JVI.03276-13.abstract?maxtoshow=&hits=21&RESULTFORMAT=&andorexacttitle=and&andorexacttitleabs=and&fulltext=malaria&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&usestrictdates=yes&resourcetype=HWCIT&ct"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/early\/2014\/02\/13\/JVI.03276-13.full.pdf","pmid":"24554655","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"VSV-GP: A potent Viral Vaccine Vector that Boosts the Immune Response upon Repeated Applications","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vsvgp-potent-viral-vaccine-vector-boosts-immune-response-upon-repeated-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2907281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98339,"mean":7.5254719843805,"rank":77995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98339,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4380,"mean":3.0084928065768,"rank":3331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4380,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":6.9546769230769,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
