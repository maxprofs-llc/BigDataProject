The inoculated strains were successfully monitored by RAPD-PCR during the process. L. rhamnosus CTC1679 was the only strain able to grow and dominate (levels ca. 10(8)CFU\/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria population in two independent trials, throughout the ripening process. Thus, fuet containing L. rhamnosus CTC1679 as a starter culture could be a suitable vehicle for putative probiotic bacteria delivery. All the final products recorded a satisfactory overall sensory quality without any noticeable off-flavour, and with the characteristic sensory properties of low-acid fermented sausages.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003081","doi":"10.1016\/j.meatsci.2013.09.008","first_seen_on":"2014-02-21T16:28:44+00:00","issns":["03091740"],"journal":"Meat Science","last_mentioned_on":1411083666,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0309174013005263","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24211552"],"pmid":"24211552","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Nutritionally enhanced fermented sausages as a vehicle for potential probiotic lactobacilli delivery.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutritionally-enhanced-fermented-sausages-vehicle-potential-probiotic-lactobacilli-delivery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":24.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":24.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":140375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":4367007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111660,"mean":8.4406377631901,"rank":6520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":105134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111660,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":3.6301096774194,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":11.019,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
