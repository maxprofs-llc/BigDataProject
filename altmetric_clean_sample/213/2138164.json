Circular dichroism (CD) spectra measured for solutions containing V(IV)O(2+) and apo-hTF, and V(IV)O-maltol and apo-hTF, clearly indicate that hTF-V(IV)O-maltol ternary species form with a V(IV)O:maltol stoichiometry of 1:1. For V(IV)O salts and several V(IV)O(carrier)n complexes (carrier ligand=maltolato, dhp, picolinato and dipicolinato) (Hdhp=1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone) the maximum number of V(IV)O(2+) bound per mole of hTF is determined to be ~2 or lower in all cases. The binding of V(IV)O to apo-hTF most certainly involves several amino acid residues of the Fe-binding site, and as concluded by urea gel electrophoresis experiments, the formation of (V(IV)O)2hTF species may occur with the closing of the hTF conformation as is the case in (Fe(III))2hTF, which is an essential feature for the transferrin receptor recognition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dfb","authors":["Mehtab S","Gon\u00e7alves G","Roy S","Tomaz AI","Santos-Silva T","Santos MF","Rom\u00e3o MJ","Jakusch T","Kiss T","Pessoa JC"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jinorgbio.2012.12.020","first_seen_on":"2014-02-22T10:20:47+00:00","issns":["0162-0134"],"journal":"Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1392947940,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jinorgbio.2012.12.020"],"pmid":"23411030","pubdate":"2013-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Interaction of vanadium(IV) with human serum apo-transferrin.","type":"article","volume":"121C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interaction-vanadiumiv-human-serum-apotransferrin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":445561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3163190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97870,"mean":7.5014333650084,"rank":14462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":82701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97870,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208,"mean":4.2595652173913,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
