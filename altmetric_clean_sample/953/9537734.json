Ustilaginoidins are bis-naphtho-\u03b3-pyrone mycotoxins previously isolated from the rice false smut balls (FSBs) infected by the pathogen Villosiclava virens in rice spikelets on panicles. To investigate the main ustilaginoidins and their distribution in rice FSBs, five main bis-naphtho-\u03b3-pyrones, namely ustilaginoidins A (1), G (2), B (3), I (4) and C (5), were isolated and identified by NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry as well as by comparison with the data in the literature. The rice FSBs at early, middle and late maturity stages were divided into their different parts and the contents of five main ustilaginoidins for each part were determined by HPLC analysis. The results revealed that the highest levels of ustilaginoidins were in late stage rice FSBs, followed by those at middle stage. Most ustilaginoidins, 96.4% of the total quantity, were distributed in the middle layer at early stage. However, ustilaginoidins were mainly distributed in the outer and middle layers at middle and late stages. Small amounts of ustilaginoidins A (1) and G (2) were found in the inner part of rice FSBs at each maturity stage. The contents of ustilaginoidins A (1) and G (2) without hydroxymethyl groups at C-2 and C-2' of the \u03b3-pyrone rings in rice FSBs were relatively high at early stage, while the contents of ustilaginoidins B (3), I (4), and C (5) with hydroxymethyl groups at C-2 or C-2' were relatively high at late stage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5373cf058f610004677","authors":["Meng, Jiajia","Sun, Weibo","Mao, Ziling","Xu, Dan","Wang, Xiaohan","Lu, Shiqiong","Lai, Daowan","Liu, Yang","Zhou, Ligang","Zhang, Guozhen"],"doi":"10.3390\/toxins7104023","endpage":"4034","first_seen_on":"2016-07-09T15:04:29+00:00","issns":["2072-6651"],"issue":"10","journal":"Toxins","last_mentioned_on":1468076647,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26473920?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26473920","pubdate":"2015-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"4023","title":"Main Ustilaginoidins and Their Distribution in Rice False Smut Balls","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/main-ustilaginoidins-distribution-rice-false-smut-balls"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8037685,"mean":6.8229478924494,"rank":6957746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8037685,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258924,"mean":11.585149036586,"rank":217516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258924,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":857,"mean":4.8206004672897,"rank":717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":857,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":5.6828,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
