Although some human microsomal P450 enzymes can instead accept the second electron from cytochrome b5, for human steroidogenic CYP17A1, the CPR FMN domain delivers both electrons and b5 is an allosteric modulator. The structural basis of these key but poorly understood protein interactions was probed by solution NMR using the catalytically competent soluble domains of each protein. Formation of the CYP17A1\u00b7FMN domain complex induced differential line broadening of the NMR signal for each protein. Alterations in the exchange dynamics generally occurred for residues near the surface of the flavin mononucleotide including 87-90 (loop 1) and for key CYP17A1 active site residues. These interactions were modulated by the identity of the substrate in the buried CYP17A1 active site and by b5. The FMN domain outcompetes b5 for binding to CYP17A1 in the three-component system. These results and comparison with previous NMR studies of the CYP17A1\u00b7b5 complex suggest a model of CYP17A1 enzyme regulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Estrada, D Fernando","Laurence, Jennifer S","Scott, Emily E","D.
