Their structures were determined by combining the spectroscopic analysis with the theoretical computations. The anti-inflammatory activities of compounds 1-4 were evaluated, and compound 3 exhibits the most significant activity in the inhibition of NO production with an IC50 value of 10.6\u00a0\u03bcM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f61000119d","authors":["Song, Qiu-Yan","Gao, Kun","Nan, Zhi-Biao"],"doi":"10.1080\/10286020.2015.1056165","endpage":"194","first_seen_on":"2016-07-09T11:22:39+00:00","issns":["1477-2213","1028-6020"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Asian Natural Products Research","last_mentioned_on":1468061137,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26313467?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26313467","pubdate":"2015-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"189","subjects":["chemistry","botany"],"title":"\n              Highly oxygenated triterpenoids from the roots of\n              Schisandra chinensis\n              and their anti-inflammatory activities\n            ","type":"article","volume":"18"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8037685,"mean":6.8229478924494,"rank":6957798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8037685,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258924,"mean":11.585306805498,"rank":217548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258924,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213,"mean":1.228679245283,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.48125,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/statuses\/751729010271350784","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9534843],"posted_on":"2016-07-09T10:45:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
