Dendritic cells (DCs) are well-known professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that initiate and regulate antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that kill their target cells directly as well as secrete IFN-\u03b3, a cytokine critical in tumor rejection. Here, we employed newly established protein cage nanoparticles, encapsulin (Encap), as antigenic peptide nanocarriers by genetically incorporating the OT-1 peptide (SIINFEKL) of ovalbumin (OVA) protein to the three different positions of Encap subunit. With them, we evaluated their efficacy in activating DC-mediated antigen-specific T cell cytotoxicity and consequent melanoma tumor rejection in vivo. DCs efficiently engulfed Encap and its variants (OT-1-Encaps), which carry antigenic peptides at different positions, and properly processed them within phagosomes. Delivered OT-1 peptides were effectively presented by DCs to na\u00efve CD8+ T cells successfully resulting in the proliferation of antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. OT-1-Encap-vaccinations in B16-OVA melanoma tumor bearing mice effectively activated OT-1 peptide specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells before or even after tumor generation resulting in significant suppression of tumor growth in prophylactic as well as therapeutic treatments. A large number of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that actively produce both intracellular and secretory IFN-\u03b3 were observed in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) collected from B16-OVA tumor masses originally vaccinated with OT-1-Encap-C upon the tumor challenges. The approaches we describe herein may provide opportunities to develop new epitope-dependent vaccination systems that stimulate and\/or modulate efficient and epitope-specific cytotoxic T cell immune responses in non-pathogenic diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Choi, Bongseo","Moon, Hyojin","Hong, Sung Joon","Shin, Changsik","Do, Yoonkyung","Ryu, Seoungho","Kang, Sebyung","Bongseo Choi"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.5b08084","first_seen_on":"2016-07-09T11:08:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-086X","1936-0851"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1469734184,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27390910?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsnano.5b08084"],"pmid":"27390910","pubdate":"2016-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Effective Delivery of Antigen-Encapsulin Nanoparticle Fusions to Dendritic Cells Leads to Antigen-Specific Cytotoxic T Cell Activation and Tumor Rejection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effective-delivery-antigenencapsulin-nanoparticle-fusions-dendritic-cells-leads-antigenspecific-cyto-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8426654,"mean":7.0881155172677,"rank":2009639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6378873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8426654,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261911,"mean":11.704949265014,"rank":78007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":182959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261911,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5097,"mean":12.167574175824,"rank":2158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5097,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":11.300686567164,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
