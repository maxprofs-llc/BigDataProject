The spectrum of massive states contains anyons. An ambiguity in the ground state energy is resolved by the 3D N=1 Green-Schwarz superstring, which has massless ground states describing a dilaton and dilatino, and first-excited states of spin 1\/4.","ads_id":"2010PhRvL.105s1601M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","arxiv_id":"1008.2334","authors":["Luca Mezincescu","Paul K.
