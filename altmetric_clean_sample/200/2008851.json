Since these areas are valued by the biomedical training field, this may help to bridge the attitudinal and communication gaps between these different practices. The aim of this study was to describe the training offered in these areas and gather the perceptions of curriculum\/program directors in regulated Canadian CAM schools.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b0","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6882-13-374","first_seen_on":"2013-12-29T03:47:41+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1472-6882"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1390437408,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6882\/13\/374\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6882\/13\/374"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6882-13-374.pdf","pmid":"24373181","pubdate":"2013-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"374","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"A survey of Canadian regulated complementary and alternative medicine schools about research, evidence-based health care and interprofessional training, as well as continuing education","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survey-canadian-regulated-complementary-alternative-medicine-schools-about-research-evidencebased-he"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6574878,"mean":6.0977594546637,"rank":1375809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5185979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6574878,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151963,"mean":7.635617812348,"rank":36564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":114981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151963,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1739,"mean":6.139830840046,"rank":473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1739,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":5.2967462686567,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
