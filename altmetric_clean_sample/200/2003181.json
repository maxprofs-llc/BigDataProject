The soma for these neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia that line the spinal column. Understanding the receptors and channels expressed by these sensory afferent neurons could lead to novel therapies for disease. The initial step is to identify the specific subset of sensory neurons of interest. Here we describe a method to identify afferent neurons innervating the muscles by retrograde labeling using a fluorescent dye DiI (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate). Understanding the contribution of ion channels to excitation of muscle afferents could help to better control excessive excitability induced by certain disease states such as peripheral vascular disease or heart failure. We used two approaches to identify the voltage dependent ion channels expressed by these neurons, patch clamp electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry. While electrophysiology plus pharmacological blockers can identify functional ion channel types, we used immunocytochemistry to identify channels for which specific blockers were unavailable and to better understand the ion channel distribution pattern in the cell population. These techniques can be applied to other areas of the nervous system to study specific neuronal groups.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Renuka Ramachandra","Stephanie McGrew","Keith Elmslie"],"doi":"10.3791\/50782","first_seen_on":"2013-12-24T18:35:23+00:00","funders":["niams"],"issns":["1940-087X"],"journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1387910084,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/50782\/identification-specific-sensory-neuron-populations-for-study"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/50782.pdf","pmid":"24430510","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"Identification of Specific Sensory Neuron Populations for Study of Expressed Ion Channels","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-specific-sensory-neuron-populations-study-expressed-ion-channels"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6575269,"mean":6.0981511691996,"rank":5609852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6575269,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150445,"mean":7.5743033686955,"rank":122782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150445,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3755,"mean":3.0389493873202,"rank":2935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3755,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":7.4985079365079,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
