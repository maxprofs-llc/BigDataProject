All three had complete resolution of symptomatology despite the delayed treatment. The late resolution of symptoms is evidence both of residual bubble effect and of distal tissue hypoxia responding to oxygen therapy with the recompression. We recommend that decompression sickness symptoms be treated whenever they are seen, even ten to 14 days postinjury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005724","authors":["R A Myers","P Bray"],"first_seen_on":"2013-12-24T15:03:45+00:00","issns":["0196-0644"],"issue":"3","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1387821600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3977150"],"pmid":"3977150","pubdate":"1985-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Delayed treatment of serious decompression sickness.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/delayed-treatment-serious-decompression-sickness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9302723403875,"rank":614142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3055304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111521,"mean":7.1582382711622,"rank":20738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":90490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111521,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1913,"mean":8.3736976987448,"rank":643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1913,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":7.2370571428571,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"How long can we delay recompression?","url":"http:\/\/ebmgonewild.com\/long-can-delay-recompression\/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+EBMGonewWild+%28EBM+Gone+Wild%29","citation_ids":[2002926],"posted_on":"2013-12-23T18:00:00+00:00","summary":"Decompression sickness is the clinical constellation of symptoms that result from gas bubbles that form after going from a high pressure environment to a lower pressure environment.
