Using routinely collected data, we undertook a risk adjusted cost-effectiveness (RAC-E) analysis of alternative applied models of primary health care for the management of obese adult patients. Models were based on the reported level of involvement of practice nurses (registered or enrolled nurses working in general practice) in the provision of clinical-based activities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000834f","authors":["J Karnon","H Haji Ali Afzali","J Gray","C Holton","D Banham","J Beilby","Karnon J","Afzali HH","Gray J","Holton C","Banham D","Beilby J","J.
