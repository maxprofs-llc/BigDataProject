However, there is limited knowledge of the impact of vibration on the intervertebral disc (IVD). This study was undertaken to examine the effects of acute vibration on anabolic and catabolic pathways in the IVD and to characterize the dependence of these changes on time and frequency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000231f","authors":["McCann MR","Patel P","Beaucage KL","Xiao Y","Bacher C","Siqueira WL","Holdsworth DW","Dixon SJ","S\u00e9guin CA","McCann, Matthew R.","Patel, Priya","Beaucage, Kim L.","Xiao, Yizhi","Bacher, Corey","Siqueira, Walter L.","Holdsworth, David W.","Dixon, S.
