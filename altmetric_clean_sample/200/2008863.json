We recently established the Southern African Prostate Cancer Study (SAPCS), a resource for epidemiological and genetic analysis of prostate cancer risk and outcomes in Black men from South Africa. Biased towards highly aggressive prostate cancer disease, this is the first reported data analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007dc","authors":["Tindall EA","Bornman MR","van Zyl S","Segone AM","Monare LR","Venter PA","Hayes VM"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2490-13-74","first_seen_on":"2013-12-29T04:00:08+00:00","issns":["1471-2490",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Urology","last_mentioned_on":1441382787,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2490\/13\/74\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2490-13-74.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3882498","pmid":"24373635","pubdate":"2013-12-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"74","title":"Addressing the contribution of previously described genetic and epidemiological risk factors associated with increased prostate cancer risk and aggressive disease within men from South Africa","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/addressing-contribution-previously-described-genetic-epidemiological-risk-factors-associated-increas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6223307,"mean":5.8526115203049,"rank":2481032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3681428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6223307,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142574,"mean":7.8067064451197,"rank":55452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":85288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142574,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180,"mean":5.764905027933,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.3875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
