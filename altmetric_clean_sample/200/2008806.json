This pilot project was conducted in collaboration with a regional supermarket chain and endeavored to develop population-based strategies for reducing sodium intake. Key interventions included marketing strategies, taste test demonstrations, and a public media campaign. Project staff worked closely with corporate registered dietitian nutritionists, a nutrition specialist, and an advertising agency in its development and implementation. A social marketing approach was used to educate consumers about the hidden sources of dietary sodium, to raise awareness of the adverse health effects of excess sodium intake, to encourage consumers to read food labels, and to urge them to purchase food items lower in sodium. The lessons learned from this experience may be of assistance to other communities that seek to implement similar sodium-reduction strategies in the grocery store environment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a99","doi":"10.1097\/phh.0b013e3182a0b91a","first_seen_on":"2013-12-29T01:54:28+00:00","issns":["1078-4659"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Public Health Management & Practice","last_mentioned_on":1388282050,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jphmp\/Fulltext\/2014\/01001\/Working_With_Grocers_to_Reduce_Dietary_Sodium__.10.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jphmp\/2014\/01001\/Working_With_Grocers_to_Reduce_Dietary_Sodium__.10.pdf","pmid":"24322816","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S54","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Working With Grocers to Reduce Dietary Sodium: Lessons Learned From the Broome County Sodium Reduction in Communities Pilot Project","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/working-grocers-reduce-dietary-sodium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3064095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121869,"mean":7.6091285653333,"rank":79831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121869,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":785,"mean":2.0045867346939,"rank":498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":785,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.3675,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JPHMPonline\/status\/417111267115954176","license":"public","citation_ids":[2008806],"posted_on":"2013-12-29T01:54:10+00:00","author":{"name":"JPHMP Direct","url":"http:\/\/jphmpdirect.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/803662267942367232\/JXMviNj9_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Public Health Management & Practice publishes articles focusing on evidence-based #publichealth practice and research.
