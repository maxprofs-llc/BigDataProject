Participants (n = 25) from a longitudinal study of rural drug users (N = 192) were approached to participate in semistructured qualitative interviews between April and June 2011. The primary finding is that the majority of participants switched from using the original formulation OxyContin to immediate-release oxycodone. We discuss the implications and limitations of these findings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5373cf058f610004624","authors":["Lesly-Marie Buer","Jennifer R.
