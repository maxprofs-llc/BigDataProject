Evidence indicates that the LESL may be a flow-sensing organelle and that perhaps through flow-induced lectin (L)\u00b7oligosaccharide (O) complex formation (L\u00b7O) participates in this process. LESL integrins and selectins are both lectinic and flow sensitive, but the L properties of flow-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the presence of L in the LESL and hypothesized that if flow-sensitive GPCRs are L, flow and O will determine their response to receptor activation. The LESL protein fraction isolated from guinea pig hearts was passed through an affinity chromatography column made of three sugars, mannose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine, and the lectinic fraction was eluted. Immune dot blot was used to identify L proteins in the LESL fraction. Our results indicate the following. 1) Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (2D-SDS-PAGE) of the LESL lectinic fraction revealed at least 167 Ls. 2) Among these Ls, we identified three selectins and the GPCRs: angiotensin II, bradykinin (B2-R), adenosine A1 and A2, prolactin, endothelin, \u03b11-adrenergic (\u03b11A-R), thromboxane A2, \u03b21-adrenergic, \u03b23-adrenergic, and insulin receptors; the first six GPCRs are known to be flow sensitive. 3) The amplitude of receptor-induced vascular responses by \u03b11A-R and B2-R activation (phenylephrine or bradykinin, respectively) was a function of flow and O (hyaluronidate). Our results support a novel mechanism of GPCR-mediated responses to flow via L\u00b7O interaction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002210","authors":["Sandra Perez-Aguilar","David Torres-Tirado","Guadalupe Martell-Gallegos","Jimena Velarde-Salcedo","Ana Barba de la Rosa","Maureen Knabb","Rafael Rubio"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajpheart.00481.2013","first_seen_on":"2013-12-24T12:49:29+00:00","issns":["1522-1539"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Heart & Circulatory Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1387889319,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24363307?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24363307","pubdate":"2013-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","cardiology"],"title":"G-protein coupled receptors mediate coronary flow and agonist-induced responses via lectin- oligosaccharide interactions.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/g-proteincoupled-receptors-mediate-coronary-flow-agonistinduced-responses-via-lectinoligosaccharide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3064189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120998,"mean":7.5426019653383,"rank":79290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":26879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120998,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1087,"mean":1.9765580110497,"rank":627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1087,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":4.1615384615385,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
