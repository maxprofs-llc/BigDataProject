However, their origin and function in the circulation is still under discussion. In the present study we analyzed changes in the miRNAs in blood plasma of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients in response to radiochemotherapy and compared them to the changes in a cell culture model of primary HNSCC cells undergoing simulated anti-cancer therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000088f","doi":"10.1186\/1748-717x-8-296","first_seen_on":"2013-12-28T22:47:16+00:00","issns":["1748-717X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Radiation Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1388270821,"links":["http:\/\/www.ro-journal.com\/content\/8\/1\/296\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ro-journal.com\/content\/pdf\/1748-717X-8-296.pdf","pmid":"24373621","pubdate":"2013-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"296","subjects":["neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Changes in circulating microRNAs after radiochemotherapy in head and neck cancer patients","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changes-circulating-micrornas-after-radiochemotherapy-head-neck-cancer-patients-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":2017206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":936200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110582,"mean":7.1981497544788,"rank":55727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":30787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110582,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":679,"mean":1.9518761061947,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":679,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":2.3754716981132,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
