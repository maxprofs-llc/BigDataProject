Two promising strategies are tailoring and narrative-based approaches. Tailoring is the personalization of information based on individual characteristics. Narrative-based approaches use stories about similar others to counter perceived barriers and cultivate self-efficacy. To compare these two approaches, a randomized controlled trial was carried out at 8 worksites in Indiana. Adults 50-75 (N\u00a0=\u00a0209) received one of four messages about colorectal cancer screening: stock, narrative, tailored, tailored narrative. The primary outcome was whether participants filed a colonoscopy claim in the 18 months following the intervention. Individuals receiving narrative messages were 4 times more likely to screen than those not receiving narrative messages. Tailoring did not increase screening behavior overall. However, individuals with higher cancer information overload were 8 times more likely to screen if they received tailored messages. The results suggest that narrative-based approaches are more effective than tailoring at increasing colorectal cancer screening in worksite interventions. Tailoring may be valuable as a strategy for reaching individuals with high overload, perhaps as a follow-up effort to a larger communication campaign.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008969","doi":"10.1016\/j.socscimed.2013.12.003","first_seen_on":"2013-12-26T17:50:46+00:00","issns":["02779536"],"journal":"Social Science & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1407320139,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0277953613006771","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24581059","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24581059?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24581059","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"title":"Comparing tailored and narrative worksite interventions at increasing colonoscopy adherence in adults 50-75: A randomized controlled trial.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparing-tailored-narrative-worksite-interventions-increasing-colonoscopy-adherence-adults-5075-ran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7541160,"mean":6.5134191388842,"rank":930398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6590252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7541160,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178005,"mean":6.9871931304917,"rank":23364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":154221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178005,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5331,"mean":9.2354983114447,"rank":1271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":4036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5331,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":13.23864516129,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
