Alterations in the vessel wall common to many cardiovascular disorders have been shown to initiate the activity of the coagulation system, but also to be the result of an abnormal coagulation system. The primary link between the coagulation and the vascular system appears to be tissue factor (TF), which is induced on the surface of vascular cells and initiates the extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, leading to the formation of thrombin. Thrombin can also interact with the vascular wall via specific receptors and can increase vascular TF expression. Such a \"thrombogenic cycle\" may be essentially involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders associated with an abnormal coagulation. Therefore, the identification of the signaling pathways regulating this cycle and each of its relevant connecting links is of fundamental importance for the understanding of these disorders and their putative therapeutic potential. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ROS-generating NADPH oxidases have been shown to play important roles as signaling molecules in the vasculature. In this review, we summarize the data supporting a substantial role of ROS in promoting a thrombogenic cycle in the vascular system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022ba","authors":["Olaf Herkert","Talija Djordjevic","Rachida S BelAiba","Agnes G\u00f6rlach"],"doi":"10.1089\/1523086041361695","first_seen_on":"2013-12-28T02:04:19+00:00","issns":["1523-0864"],"issue":"4","journal":"Antioxidants & Redox Signaling","last_mentioned_on":1388215324,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15242558"],"pmid":"15242558","pubdate":"2004-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Insights into the redox control of blood coagulation: role of vascular NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species in the thrombogenic cycle.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insights-redox-control-blood-coagulation-role-vascular-nadph-oxidasederived-reactive-oxygen-species"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2749135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":719681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110408,"mean":7.2049752642497,"rank":81398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":23834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110408,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":494,"mean":2.4917403651116,"rank":360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":494,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.8259259259259,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
