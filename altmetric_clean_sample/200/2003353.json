The dog was fed a homemade diet deficient in calcium and vitamin D, suggesting that rubber jaw syndrome was a secondary nutritional disorder. Radiographic and tomodensitometric examinations revealed diffuse bone resorption in the skull. The plasma parathormone concentration was high, and serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol concentration was low. Based on these findings, nutritional calcium and vitamin D deficiency associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism was diagnosed. Dietary correction resulted in clinical and biological improvement, with an increase in skull mineralization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8f","authors":["Pauline de Fornel-Thibaud","G\u00e9raldine Blanchard","Laurence Escoffier-Chateau","Sophie Segond","Franck Guetta","Dominique Begon","Fran\u00e7oise Delisle","Dan Rosenberg"],"doi":"10.5326\/0430052","first_seen_on":"2013-12-24T21:30:48+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1547-3317"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association","last_mentioned_on":1387920591,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/17209086\/?i=17&from=\/15690240\/related"],"pmid":"17209086","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Unusual case of osteopenia associated with nutritional calcium and vitamin D deficiency in an adult dog.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unusual-case-osteopenia-associated-nutritional-calcium-vitamin-d-deficiency-adult-dog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3064185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120999,"mean":7.5425615299429,"rank":79290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":26879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120999,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242,"mean":1.6054854771784,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":7,"Other":6,"Student  > Master":5,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":15,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6,"Unspecified":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":8}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1,"GB":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VitaDoc1\/status\/415595197716631552","license":"public","citation_ids":[2003353],"posted_on":"2013-12-24T21:29:51+00:00","author":{"name":"TheVitaDoc","url":"http:\/\/www.TheVitaDoc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3132566100\/1a097ca159398b9e6ca8e0437b7097b0_normal.jpeg","description":"Expert Vitamin, Mineral, Fat\/Oils, Wt Loss, Diet & Health Info. \nNo Products\/Gimmicks\/Fees. \nOptimal Nutrition = Ideal Health http:\/\/www.Facebook.com\/TheVitaDoc","id_on_source":"VitaDoc1","tweeter_id":"170732404","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":25941},"tweet_id":"415595197716631552"}]}}
