Previous studies have reported that both entities may be present in the same individual in less than 5% of the cases. The most frequent form of hereditary colorectal cancer is the Lynch syndrome or Hereditary Non-polyposic Colorectal Cancer, which is associated with germ-line mutation mostly of two genes, MLH1 and MSH2, which account for almost 90 percent of all identified mutations. The hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome is caused by a germ-line mutation in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene; only about 50 families with this syndrome have been reported. We present a case report of a patient who was diagnosed with both syndromes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccc4","authors":["R Casta\u00f1eda-Arg\u00e1iz","Q H Gonz\u00e1lez-Contreras","H Medina-Franco","H A Rodr\u00edguez-Zentner","H Tapia-Cid de Le\u00f3n","O Vergara-Fern\u00e1ndez"],"first_seen_on":"2013-12-25T11:05:13+00:00","issns":["0375-0906"],"issue":"3","journal":"Revista de gastroenterolog\u00eda de M\u00e9xico","last_mentioned_on":1387969806,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19858019?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"19858019","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"[Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer associated with hereditary gastric cancer.
