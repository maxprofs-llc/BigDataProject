These building blocks are suitable for modification at an amino acid as well as at a peptide level. Moreover, these methods have embedded several points for diversification and are capable of producing a library of modified amino acids and peptides. We have employed highly atom-economic processes such as the Diels-Alder reaction, [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition, Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling, and olefin metathesis as key steps to assemble various unnatural amino acid derivatives and peptides. In some instances, we have used rongalite to generate Diels-Alder precursors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Sambasivarao Kotha","Deepti Goyal","Arjun S.
