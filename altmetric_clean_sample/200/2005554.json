Serum concentrations were determined by HPLC-MS\/MS assay and cefquinome concentration vs. time data after IV and IM were best fit to a two-compartment open model. Cefquinome mean values of area under concentration-time curve (AUC) were 5.15\u00a0\u03bcg\u00b7h\/mL for IV dose and 4.59\u00a0\u03bcg\u00b7h\/mL for IM dose. Distribution half-lives and elimination half-lives after IV dose and IM dose were 0.27 and 0.44\u00a0h, 1.53 and 1.94\u00a0h, respectively. Values of total body clearance (ClB ) and volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss ) were 0.49\u00a0L\u00b7kg\/h and 0.81\u00a0L\/kg, respectively. After IM dose, Cmax was 2.53\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL and the bioavailability was 89.13%. For PD profile, the determined MIC and MBC values against K.\u00a0pneumonia were 0.030 and 0.060\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL in MHB and 0.032 and 0.064\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL in serum. The ex vivo time-kill curves also were established in serum. In conjunction with the data on MIC, MBC values and the ex vivo bactericidal activity in serum, the present results allowed prediction that a single cefquinome dosage of 2\u00a0mg\/kg may be effective in dogs against K.\u00a0pneumonia infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f8e","authors":["Zhang, B.","Gu, X.","Li, X.","Gu, M.","Zhang, N.","Shen, X.","Li, Y.","Ding, H."],"doi":"10.1111\/jvp.12100","endpage":"373","first_seen_on":"2013-12-26T15:31:04+00:00","issns":["1365-2885","0140-7783"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1388071845,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvp.12100\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvp.12100\/pdf","pmid":"24372291","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"367","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Pharmacokinetics and ex\u2010vivo pharmacodynamics of cefquinome against Klebsiella pneumonia in healthy dogs","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacokinetics-exvivo-pharmacodynamics-cefquinome-against-klebsiella-pneumonia-healthy-dogs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6692298,"mean":6.1588091720951,"rank":5715424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6692298,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172553,"mean":6.9025578840005,"rank":138573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172553,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241,"mean":1.4664583333333,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.2125,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
