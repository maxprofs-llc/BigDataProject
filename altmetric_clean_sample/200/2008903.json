The mechanism of these interventions is not fully understood. A reduction in resistance to treatment may explain the mechanism by which TPE empowers participants to improve self-management. The Objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of diabetes groups in reducing resistance to treatment and the association between reduced resistance and better management of the disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b4","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6823-13-61","first_seen_on":"2013-12-29T06:24:03+00:00","issns":["1472-6823"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Endocrine Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1390746680,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6823\/13\/61\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6823-13-61.pdf","pmid":"24373686","pubdate":"2013-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"61","title":"Reducing resistance to treatment, through group intervention, improves clinical measurements in patients with type 2 diabetes","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reducing-resistance-treatment-through-group-intervention-improves-clinical-measurements-patients-typ-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6575269,"mean":6.0981511691996,"rank":2442800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4033825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6575269,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151966,"mean":7.6345417958084,"rank":53033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":96037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151966,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190,"mean":4.8225502645503,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":6.0021818181818,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
