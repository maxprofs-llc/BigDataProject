Devices and technology continue to evolve. We report three cases from our institution where the new Gore Septal Occluder was utilized for the closure of a lateral tunnel fenestration, a moderate-sized secundum atrial septal defect and a long tunnel patent foramen ovale. Each case highlights the successful use of this new generation device in challenging circumstances.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e05","authors":["C J Lockhart","N G Johnston","M S Spence"],"doi":"10.1002\/ccd.24736","first_seen_on":"2013-12-29T11:03:44+00:00","issns":["1522-726X"],"issue":"7","journal":"Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (Formerly Catheterization and Cardiovascular Diagnosis)","last_mentioned_on":1388315005,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23418128?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23418128","pubdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Experience using the new GORE Septal Occluder at the margins.","type":"article","volume":"81","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/experience-using-new-gore-septal-occluder-margins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635017,"mean":4.9194226118571,"rank":2899272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635017,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111235,"mean":7.2029077799956,"rank":86811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111235,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":576,"mean":0.98336347826087,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":576,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":0.60116279069767,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
