Through these processes, miR-126 is implicated in cancer biology, but its role there has not been well reviewed. The aim of this review is to examine the molecular mechanisms and clinicopathological significance of miR-126 in human cancers. miR-126 was shown to have roles in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, genital tracts, breast, thyroid, lung and some other cancers. Its expression was suppressed in most of the cancers studied. The molecular mechanisms that are known to cause aberrant expression of miR-126 include alterations in gene sequence, epigenetic modification and alteration of dicer abundance. miR-126 can inhibit progression of some cancers via negative control of proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell survival. In some instances, however, miR-126 supports cancer progression via promotion of blood vessel formation. Downregulation of miR-126 induces cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via targeting specific oncogenes. Also, reduced levels of miR-126 are a significant predictor of poor survival of patients in many cancers. In addition, miR-126 can alter a multitude of cellular mechanisms in cancer pathogenesis via suppressing gene translation of numerous validated targets such as PI3K, KRAS, EGFL7, CRK, ADAM9, HOXA9, IRS-1, SOX-2, SLC7A5 and VEGF. To conclude, miR-126 is commonly down-regulated in cancer, most likely due to its ability to inhibit cancer cell growth, adhesion, migration, and invasion through suppressing a range of important gene targets. Understanding these mechanisms by which miR-126 is involved with cancer pathogenesis will be useful in the development of therapeutic targets for the management of patients with cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000288e","authors":["Faeza Ebrahimi","Vinod Gopalan","Robert Anthony Smith","Alfred King-Yin Lam","Ebrahimi F","Gopalan V","Smith RA","Lam AK"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yexmp.2013.12.004","endpage":"107","first_seen_on":"2013-12-27T02:27:26+00:00","issns":["1096-0945","0014-4800","00144800"],"issue":"1","journal":"Experimental & Molecular Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1388103787,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24368110\/"],"pmid":"24368110","pubdate":"2013-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"98","subjects":["molecularbiology","pathology"],"title":"miR-126 in human cancers: clinical roles and current perspectives.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0014480013001500","volume":"96","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir126-human-cancers-clinical-roles-current-perspectives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229233,"mean":5.9658211095702,"rank":4606828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229233,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143402,"mean":7.719996820106,"rank":95718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":26881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143402,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304,"mean":1.6703300330033,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.62,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
