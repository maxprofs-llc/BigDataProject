A retrospective review of patient charts was completed to determine success or failure in the day hospital program based on weight above or below 85% of ideal body weight. There was not a greater risk of failure in the day hospital program for patients with ideal body weight below 85% compared to those patients with an ideal body weight of \u2265 to 85%. Body weight did not predict day hospital success in adolescents with anorexia nervosa in this study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f61000179e","authors":["Michelle Ngo","Leanna Isserlin","Ngo M","Isserlin L"],"doi":"10.1080\/10640266.2014.857522","endpage":"71","first_seen_on":"2013-12-26T16:43:19+00:00","issns":["1532-530X","1064-0266"],"issue":"1","journal":"Eating Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1388105148,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24365528?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24365528","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"62","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Body weight as a prognostic factor for day hospital success in adolescents with anorexia nervosa.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10640266.2014.857522","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/body-weight-prognostic-factor-day-hospital-success-adolescents-anorexia-nervosa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635017,"mean":4.9194226118571,"rank":2741267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":735747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635017,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111199,"mean":7.1474041619457,"rank":81512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":24437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111199,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":4.6805862068966,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.439375,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
