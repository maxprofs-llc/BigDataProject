Specific gut bacteria seem to serve as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sources and several reports claim a role for increased intestinal permeability in the genesis of metabolic disorders. Therefore, we investigated the serum levels of LPS and zonulin (ZO-1, a marker of gut permeability) along with systemic levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to control subjects. Study subjects were recruited from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study [CURES], Chennai, India. Study group (n\u00a0=\u00a045 each) comprised of a) subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and (b) patients with T2DM. LPS, ZO-1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 levels were measured by ELISA. Serum levels of LPS [p\u00a0<\u00a00.05], LPS activity [p\u00a0<\u00a00.001], ZO-1 [p\u00a0<\u00a00.001], TNF\u03b1 [p\u00a0<\u00a00.001], and IL-6 [p\u00a0<\u00a00.001] were significantly increased in patients with T2DM compared to control subjects. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that LPS activity was significantly and positively correlated with ZO-1, fasting plasma glucose, 2\u00a0h post glucose, HbA1c, serum triglycerides, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and negatively correlated with HDL cholesterol. Regression analysis showed that increased LPS levels were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 13.43, 95\u00a0% CI 1.998-18.9; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003]. In Asian Indians who are considered highly insulin resistant, the circulatory LPS levels, LPS activity, and ZO-1 were significantly increased in patients with type 2 diabetes and showed positive correlation with inflammatory markers and poor glycemic\/lipid control.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081d8","authors":["B.
