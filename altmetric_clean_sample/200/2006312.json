We compared impression formation of 17 subjects with high-functioning autism (HFA) and 17 age-, gender- and IQ-matched controls. Information about the profession of a job applicant served as stereotype activating information. The target person's nonverbal behavior was presented as a computer animation showing two virtual characters in interaction. Contrary to our hypothesis, HFA participants were as sensitive to nonverbal cues as controls. Moreover, HFA showed a tendency to evaluate persons more positively. This might indicate a routine HFA apply in impression formation in order to compensate for their deficit in intuitive understanding of nonverbal communication cues.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb4","authors":["Caroline Schwartz","Thomas Dratsch","Kai Vogeley","Gary Bente"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10803-013-2021-6","first_seen_on":"2013-12-27T02:21:59+00:00","issns":["1573-3432","0162-3257"],"journal":"Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1412205709,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10803-013-2021-6","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s10803-013-2021-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10803-013-2021-6.pdf","pmid":"24362848","pubdate":"2013-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Child and School Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Brief Report: Impression Formation in High-Functioning Autism: Role of Nonverbal Behavior and Stereotype Activating Information","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brief-report-impression-formation-highfunctioning-autism-role-nonverbal-behavior-stereotype-activati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7091398,"mean":6.294731125049,"rank":3328948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3577741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7091398,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175395,"mean":6.9544929473074,"rank":73502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":95982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175395,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2155,"mean":8.7640148560817,"rank":1628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2155,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":11.050875,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
