Major anthocyanins in BBA, BKA and BCA were malvidin-3-glucoside (16%), cyanidin-3-glucoside (98%) and delphinidin-3-rutinoside (44%), respectively. BKA showed higher total antioxidant capacity than BBA and BCA. RAW 264.7 macrophages were incubated with 0-20 \u03bcg\/ml of BBA, BKA and BCA, and subsequently activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to measure proinflammatory cytokine production. Interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were significantly decreased by all berry anthocyanins at 10 \u03bcg\/ml or higher. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) mRNA levels and secretion were also significantly decreased in LPS-treated macrophages. The levels of the repression were comparable for all berry anthocyanins. LPS-induced nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65 translocation to the nucleus was markedly attenuated by all of the berry anthocyanins. In bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 wild-type (Nrf2(+\/+)) mice, BBA, BKA and BCA significantly decreased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels with a concomitant decrease in IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels upon LPS stimulation. However, in the BMM from Nrf2(-\/-) mice, the anthocyanin fractions were able to significantly decrease IL-1\u03b2 mRNA despite the fact that ROS levels were not significantly affected. In conclusion, BBA, BKA and BCA exert their anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages, at least in part, by inhibiting nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB independent of the NRF2-mediated pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8f","authors":["Lee, Sang Gil","Kim, Bohkyung","Yang, Yue","Pham, Tho X.","Park, Young-Ki","Manatou, Jose","Koo, Sung I.","Chun, Ock K.","Lee, Ji-Young","Lee SG","Kim B","Yang Y","Pham TX","Park YK","Manatou J","Koo SI","Chun OK","Lee JY"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jnutbio.2013.12.001","first_seen_on":"2014-04-10T09:42:34+00:00","issns":["0955-2863"],"journal":"Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1421735669,"links":["http:\/\/www.jnutbio.com\/article\/S0955-2863(13)00261-1\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24565673"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jnutbio.com\/article\/S0955-2863(13)00261-1\/pdf","pmid":"24565673","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Berry anthocyanins suppress the expression and secretion of proinflammatory mediators in macrophages by inhibiting nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB independent of NRF2-mediated mechanism.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/berry-anthocyanins-suppress-expression-secretion-proinflammatory-mediators-macrophages-inhibiting-nu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019263,"mean":6.7829620361534,"rank":3635614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4304023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019263,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177446,"mean":7.3875696243909,"rank":67397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":107788,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177446,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":905,"mean":7.0202411504425,"rank":401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":905,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":6.496375,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
