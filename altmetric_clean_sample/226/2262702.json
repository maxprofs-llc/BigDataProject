By this combined method, mechanically stable and flexible free-standing nanopore membranes with a thickness down to 15-30 nm were produced. The plasmon resonances of the ultrathin plasmonic nanopores fabricated in AlN\/Au\/AlN trilayer and single layer Au membranes were tuned to lie in the vis-NIR wavelength range by properly designing their dimensions. The optical responses to the refractive index changes were tested and applied to adlayer sensing. The trilayer nanopore membrane showed a unique property to support water only on one side of the membrane, which was confirmed by the resonance shift and comparison with numerical simulation. Pore size reduction down to 10 nm can be achieved through additional material deposition. The filtering function of such pore-size-reduced conical shaped nanofunnels has also been demonstrated. The presented nanopore fabrication method offers new platforms for ultrathin nanopore sensing or filtering devices with controlled pore-size and optical properties. The film transfer technique employed in this work would enable the transformation of any substrate-based nanostructures to free-standing membrane based devices without complicated multiple etching processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Juliane Junesch","Takumi Sannomiya"],"doi":"10.1021\/am405443y","first_seen_on":"2014-04-08T09:15:18+00:00","issns":["1944-8244","1944-8252"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1396948490,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/am405443y"],"pmid":"24701958","pubdate":"2014-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
