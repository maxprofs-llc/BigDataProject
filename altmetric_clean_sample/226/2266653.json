Because no meta-analysis has investigated the relation of physical activity to gastroesophageal cancer, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis according to the PRISMA guidelines based on 24 studies with a total of 15,745 cases. When we compared high versus low physical activity levels and summarized associations according to anatomic site and tumor histology, risk reductions were evident for esophageal adenocarcinoma [relative risk (RR) = 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.66-0.94], gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (RR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.69-0.99) and gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma (RR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.62-0.84). The risk reduction for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.41-2.16) became statistically significant (RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.46-0.96) after excluding an influential study. The test for heterogeneity by gastroesophageal cancer subtype was statistically non-significant (p-difference = 0.71). The RR of total gastroesophageal cancer for high versus low physical activity was 0.82 (95% CI = 0.74-0.90). A dose-response analysis of frequency of physical activity and total gastroesophageal cancer risk revealed that the greatest risk reduction was achieved among those engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity five times per week (RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.58-0.79). Our results provide support for an inverse relation of physical activity, in particular exercise frequency, to gastroesophageal cancer risk.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000734b","authors":["Gundula Behrens","Carmen Jochem","Marlen Keimling","Cristian Ricci","Daniela Schmid","Michael Fred Leitzmann","Behrens G","Jochem C","Keimling M","Ricci C","Schmid D","Leitzmann MF"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10654-014-9895-2","first_seen_on":"2014-04-09T07:16:11+00:00","issns":["1573-7284","0393-2990"],"issue":"3","journal":"European Journal of Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1463602215,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24705782"],"pmid":"24705782","pubdate":"2014-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Kluwer Academic Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"The association between physical activity and gastroesophageal cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-physical-activity-gastroesophageal-cancer-systematic-review-metaanalysis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":33.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":33.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715105,"mean":6.6184650148513,"rank":236104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7478775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715105,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175793,"mean":7.2999138527354,"rank":7114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":168673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175793,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":697,"mean":7.8326379310345,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":697,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":6.834380952381,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
