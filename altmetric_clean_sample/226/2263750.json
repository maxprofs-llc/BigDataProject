Using techniques that were effective with other viruses, they prepared vaccines designed to generate antibody or T-cell responses, but they were ineffective in clinical trials. In this article, we consider the role of complement in host defense against enveloped viruses, the role it might play in the antibody response and why complement has not controlled HIV-1 infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007070","authors":["Frank MM","Hester C","Jiang H","Michael M.
