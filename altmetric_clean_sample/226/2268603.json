(R. Ameloot)"],"citation":{"abstract":"A photobase generator was used to induce metal-organic framework (MOF) nucleation upon UV irradiation. This method was further developed into a simple, one-step method for depositing patterned MOF films. Furthermore, the ability of our method to coat a single substrate with MOF films having different chemical compositions is illustrated. The method is an important step towards integrating MOF deposition with existing lithographic techniques and the incorporation of these materials into sensors and other electronic devices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Keitz, Benjamin K.","Yu, Chung Jui","Long, Jeffrey R.","Ameloot, Rob"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201400580","endpage":"5565","first_seen_on":"2014-04-09T21:50:45+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"22","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
