Bedside percutaneous tracheostomy has become an increasingly popular option to standard open tracheostomy. Several contraindications for percutaneous tracheostomy, including an enlarged thyroid isthmus, have been described. However, as experience with this technique has increased, most of the described contraindications appear to be relative rather than absolute, provided the procedure is performed by an experienced practitioner. Herein we present a case of an unavoidable direct puncture of the thyroid isthmus during a percutaneous tracheostomy. The procedure was performed smoothly, and no complications occurred.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"53222dc92a83ee27268b4597","authors":["Duann, Chi\u2010Wei","Hsieh, Min\u2010Shiau","Chen, Pin\u2010Tarng","Chou, Hsiao\u2010Ping","Huang, Chien\u2010Sheng"],"doi":"10.1002\/rcr2.48","endpage":"60","first_seen_on":"2014-04-08T09:09:50+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["2051-3380",""],"issue":"2","journal":"Respirology Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1396965794,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcr2.48\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcr2.48\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4184506","pmid":"25473567","pubdate":"2014-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"57","title":"Successful percutaneous tracheostomy via puncture through the thyroid isthmus","type":"article","volume":"2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6303760,"mean":5.9764780024114,"rank":4658198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6303760,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141891,"mean":7.8989738670803,"rank":94705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":25573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141891,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":0.73303571428571,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.55833333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RespirologyAPSR\/status\/453442603028340736","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2262657],"posted_on":"2014-04-08T08:01:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Respirology","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1111\/(ISSN)1440-1843","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/521823148656701440\/90870c35_normal.jpeg","description":"Official Journal of the Asian Pacific Society of Respirology","id_on_source":"RespirologyAPSR","tweeter_id":"867483486","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1382},"tweet_id":"453442603028340736"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RespirologyAPSR\/status\/453337148977348608","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2262657],"posted_on":"2014-04-08T01:02:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Respirology","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1111\/(ISSN)1440-1843","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/521823148656701440\/90870c35_normal.jpeg","description":"Official Journal of the Asian Pacific Society of Respirology","id_on_source":"RespirologyAPSR","tweeter_id":"867483486","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1382},"tweet_id":"453337148977348608"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RespirologyAPSR\/status\/453533531239903232","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2262657],"posted_on":"2014-04-08T14:03:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Respirology","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1111\/(ISSN)1440-1843","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/521823148656701440\/90870c35_normal.jpeg","description":"Official Journal of the Asian Pacific Society of Respirology","id_on_source":"RespirologyAPSR","tweeter_id":"867483486","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1382},"tweet_id":"453533531239903232"}]}}
