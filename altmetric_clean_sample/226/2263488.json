PBDEs have been shown to affect human neuronal, endocrine and reproductive systems, but their effect on the immune system is not well understood. In this study, experimental adult mice were intragastrically administered 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) at doses of 8, 80 or 800\u00a0mg\/kg of body weight (bw) at 2-day intervals. Our results showed that continuous exposure to BDE-209 resulted in high levels of BDE-209 in the plasma that approached the levels found in people who work in professions with high risks of PDBE exposure. Reduced leukocytes, decreased cytokine (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1) production and lower CD8 T-cell proliferation were observed in the mice exposed to BDE-209. Additionally, mice with long-term BDE-209 exposure had lower numbers of antigen-specific CD8 T cells after immunization with recombinant Listeria monocytogenes expressing ovalbumin (rLm-OVA) and the OVA-specific CD8 T cells had reduced functionality. Taken together, our study demonstrates that continuous BDE-209 exposure causes adverse effects on the number and functionality of immune cells in adult mice.Cellular & Molecular Immunology advance online publication, 7 April 2014; doi:10.1038\/cmi.2014.16.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e24","authors":["Weihong Zeng","Ying Wang","Zhicui Liu","Asma Khanniche","Qingliang Hu","Yan Feng","Weiyi Ye","Jianglong Yang","Shujun Wang","Lin Zhou","Hao Shen","Yan Wang"],"doi":"10.1038\/cmi.2014.16","first_seen_on":"2014-04-08T11:26:34+00:00","issns":["2042-0226"],"journal":"Cellular & Molecular Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1429265348,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24705197?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24705197","pubdate":"2014-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Long-term exposure to decabrominated diphenyl ether impairs CD8 T-cell function in adult mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-exposure-decabrominated-diphenyl-ether-impairs-cd8-tcell-function-adult-mice-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5005300,"mean":5.928903969976,"rank":2657476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1675703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5005300,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122176,"mean":8.1352690157562,"rank":61170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":44794,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122176,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":339,"mean":5.5550828402367,"rank":226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":339,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.4833333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ZA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/status\/453477619938258944","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2263488],"posted_on":"2014-04-08T10:21:04+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":62},"tweet_id":"453477619938258944"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/status\/589007679248437248","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2263488],"posted_on":"2015-04-17T10:09:08+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":62},"tweet_id":"589007679248437248"}]}}
