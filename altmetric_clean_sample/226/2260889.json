Very few prospective studies are available in a country like India, which tried to analyze the prediction of sepsis using serum procalcitonin (PCT) in such a large scale among trauma patients. This study explores the role of the biomarker PCT in early diagnosis of sepsis and prediction of outcomes in severe trauma cases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004035","authors":["Rajkumari N","Mathur P","Sharma S","Gupta B","Bhoi S","Misra MC"],"doi":"10.4103\/0974-2727.119852","first_seen_on":"2014-04-07T11:23:05+00:00","issns":["0974-2727"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Laboratory Physicians","last_mentioned_on":1396869722,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24701102"],"pmid":"24701102","pubdate":"2014-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Procalcitonin as a predictor of sepsis and outcome in severe trauma patients: a prospective study.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/procalcitonin-predictor-sepsis-outcome-severe-trauma-patients-prospective-study-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3067747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":945247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107102,"mean":7.854493496793,"rank":73204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":22924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107102,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":0.66515151515152,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":6,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1},"mendeley":{"AR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Procalcitonine\/status\/453130576686764032","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2260889],"posted_on":"2014-04-07T11:22:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Thermo Scientific FR","url":"http:\/\/www.thermoscientific.com\/brahms","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1689497883\/PCT4SepsisFNL_normal.jpg","description":"Actualit\u00e9s de la Procalcitonine\/PCT en France. \r\nCE marked but specific product claims may differ from country to country based on regulations and approvals.","id_on_source":"Procalcitonine","tweeter_id":"372760748","geo":{"lt":46,"ln":2,"country":"FR"},"followers":250},"tweet_id":"453130576686764032"}]}}
