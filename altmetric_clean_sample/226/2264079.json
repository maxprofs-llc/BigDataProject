The overwhelming number of new catalysts and conditions recently published for the Biginelli synthesis, including in some manuscripts entitled \"catalyst-free\" and\/or \"solvent-free\" have incentivized controversies and hot debates regarding the importance of developing new catalysts and reaction conditions to perform this very important multicomponent reaction. These so-called \"catalyst-free\" reports have generated much confusion in the field, requiring urgent elucidations. In this manuscript, we exemplify, demystify, and discuss the crucial role of catalysis, solvent effects, mechanisms, kinetics, facts, presumptions, and myths associated with the Biginelli reaction aiming to avoid current and future confusion and to stimulate new approaches.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Haline G.
