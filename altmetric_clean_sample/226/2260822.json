Three distinct classes of E3 ligases have been identified that stimulate transfer of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins through either a direct or an indirect mechanism. Only recently have the catalytic mechanisms of E3 ligases begun to be elucidated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Christopher E Berndsen","Cynthia Wolberger"],"doi":"10.1038\/nsmb.2780","endpage":"307","first_seen_on":"2014-04-07T10:55:31+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1545-9993","1545-9985"],"journal":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1397227484,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nsmb.2780","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nsmb\/journal\/v21\/n4\/full\/nsmb.2780.html"],"pmid":"24699078","pubdate":"2014-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ubiquitin ligases","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Ubiquitylation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Ubiquitins","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"301","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"New insights into ubiquitin E3 ligase mechanism","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-insights-ubiquitin-e3-ligase-mechanism-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1986963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107102,"mean":7.8648913642265,"rank":43848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":60507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107102,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1632,"mean":5.8684537093807,"rank":916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1632,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":10.982956521739,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":73,"Student  > Doctoral Student":19,"Student  > Ph.
