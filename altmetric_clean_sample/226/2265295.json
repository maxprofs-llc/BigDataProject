The complexes [Pt(Nttpy)Cl]X2 (Nttpy = 4'-(p-nicotinamide-N-methylphenyl)-2,2':6',2\u2033-terpyridine, X = PF6 (1), SbF6 (2), Cl (3), ClO4 (4), OTf (5), BF4 (6)) exhibit different colors under ambient light in the solid state, going from red to orange to yellow. All of these complexes are brightly luminescent at both room temperature and 77 K. Upon gentle grinding, the yellow complexes (4-6) turn orange and exhibit bright red luminescence. The red luminescence can be changed back to yellow by the addition of a few drops of acetonitrile to the sample. Crystallographic studies of the yellow and red forms of complex 5 suggest that the mechanochromic response is likely the result of a change in intermolecular Pt\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Pt distances upon grinding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Ali Han"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic402624u","first_seen_on":"2014-04-08T19:57:28+00:00","issns":["0020-1669"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1394567910,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic402624u"],"pmid":"24617867","pubdate":"2014-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Reversible Mechanochromic Luminescence at Room Temperature in Cationic Platinum(II) Terpyridyl Complexes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reversible-mechanochromic-luminescence-room-temperature-cationic-platinumii-terpyridyl-complexes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3533614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":135105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106984,"mean":7.8712677528207,"rank":83867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106984,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.5652857619206,"rank":5244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":307,"mean":1.7868235294118,"rank":284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":307,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
