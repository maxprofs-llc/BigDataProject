The isolates were characterized by sequence analysis, and 46 Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and 47 Lactococcus garvieae were tested for susceptibility to 17 antibiotics. No resistant strains were found for \u03b2-lactam antibiotics widely used in clinical practice (penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin), and all minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were far from the resistance breakpoints. Eight strains had MIC intermediate to cefazolin. The random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR fingerprint patterns showed a slightly higher heterogeneity for Lc. lactis ssp. lactis isolates than for Lc. garvieae isolates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4a","authors":["Plumed-Ferrer, C","Barberio, A","Franklin-Guild, R","Werner, B","McDonough, P","Bennett, J","Gloria, G","Rota, N","Welcome, F","Nydam, D V","Moroni, P"],"doi":"10.3168\/jds.2015-9579","endpage":"6225","first_seen_on":"2016-06-09T19:34:23+00:00","issns":["1525-3198","00220302"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","last_mentioned_on":1465501156,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26142865?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26142865","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"6216","title":"Antimicrobial susceptibilities and random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR fingerprint characterization of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and Lactococcus garvieae isolated from bovine intramammary infections","type":"article","volume":"98","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antimicrobial-susceptibilities-random-amplified-polymorphic-dnapcr-fingerprint-characterization-lact"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7876706,"mean":6.669712343671,"rank":6821066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7876706,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268680,"mean":11.392849169455,"rank":223938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268680,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636,"mean":2.6754712517194,"rank":2875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191,"mean":3.3575263157895,"rank":156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
