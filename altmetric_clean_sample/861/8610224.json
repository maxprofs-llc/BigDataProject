We sought to determine whether exosomes are induced during lung allograft rejection and to define the antigenic compositions of human leukocyte antigen (HLA), lung associated self-antigens (SAgs), and microRNAs (miRNAs). Exosomes were isolated from sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 30 lung transplant recipients (LTxR) who were stable or had acute rejection (AR) or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Exosomes were defined by flow cytometry for CD63 and Western blotting for Annexin V. SAgs, Collagen-V (Col-V), and K\u03b11 Tubulin were examined by electron microscopy; miRNAs were profiled by Affymetrix miRNA array. Donor HLA and SAgs were detected on exosomes from LTxRs with AR and BOS, but not from stable LTxRs. Exosomes expressing Col-V were isolated from LTxR sera 3 months before AR and 6 months before BOS diagnosis, suggesting that exosomes with SAgs may be a noninvasive rejection biomarker. Exosomes isolated from LTxRs with AR or BOS also contained immunoregulatory miRNAs. We conclude that exosomes expressing donor HLA, SAgs, and immunoregulatory miRNAs are present in the circulation and local site after human lung transplantation, playing an important role in the immune-pathogenesis of acute allograft rejection and BOS.
