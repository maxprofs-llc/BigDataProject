They are used in motors, magnetic fluids, drug delivery systems, etc. Herein we report a mesoscopic ferrite bar magnet based on rod-shaped \u03b5-Fe2O3 with a large coercive field (>25\u2009kOe). The \u03b5-Fe2O3-based bar magnet is a single crystal with a single magnetic domain along the longitudinal direction. A wide frequency range spectroscopic study shows that the crystallographic a-axis of \u03b5-Fe2O3, which corresponds to the longitudinal direction of the bar magnet, plays an important role in linear and non-linear magneto-optical transitions, phonon modes, and the magnon (Kittel mode). Due to its multiferroic property, a magnetic-responsive non-linear optical sheet is manufactured as an application using an \u03b5-Fe2O3-based bar magnet, resin, and polyethylene terephthalate. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of the large coercive field property, we demonstrate that a mesoscopic \u03b5-Fe2O3 bar magnet can be used as a magnetic force microscopy probe.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Shin-ichi Ohkoshi","Asuka Namai","Takehiro Yamaoka","Marie Yoshikiyo","Kenta Imoto","Tomomichi Nasu","Shizuka Anan","Yoshikazu Umeta","Kosuke Nakagawa","Hiroko Tokoro","Takehiro Yama oka"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep27212","first_seen_on":"2016-06-09T16:37:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1467759514,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep27212","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep27212"],"pmcid":"PMC4895237","pmid":"27273575","pubdate":"2016-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Magnetic materials","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Optical materials","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Optical spectroscopy","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Materials for devices","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Nonlinear optics","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"27212","subjects":["science"],"title":"Mesoscopic bar magnet based on \u03b5-Fe2O3 hard ferrite","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mesoscopic-bar-magnet-based-%CE%B5fe2o3-hard-ferrite"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":412858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7578886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269855,"mean":11.404544027511,"rank":22393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":247416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269855,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32391,"mean":14.908953504168,"rank":3758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":28627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32391,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3154,"mean":15.394331747542,"rank":351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":2802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3154,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
