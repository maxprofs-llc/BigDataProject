However, few studies have explored in a more holistic manner the lived experiences of street children in South Africa. The main purpose of this study was to explore qualitatively the lived experiences of street children living on the street of Durban, in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Adolescents (six males and four females) between the ages of 14 and 18 years (average age=16) were purposively selected and in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted. An interpretative phenomenological analysis of the transcribed data revealed that incidence of violence and drug and alcohol use were common experiences of street life. Yet despite these challenges survival was made possible through personal and emotional strength, cultural values, religious beliefs, supportive peer relationships, and participation in sports activities. These protective, resilience resources should be strengthened in health promotion interventions with a focus on mental health, the prevention of violence, substance use, and daily physical activities that seems to provide meaning and hope.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003ea4","authors":["Frances Hills","Anna Meyer-Weitz","Kwaku Oppong Asante"],"doi":"10.3402\/qhw.v11.30302","first_seen_on":"2016-06-09T14:34:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-2631"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health & Well-Being","last_mentioned_on":1495614704,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijqhw.net\/index.php\/qhw\/article\/view\/30302","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4904070\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijqhw.net\/index.php\/qhw\/article\/download\/30302\/47091","pmcid":"PMC4904070","pmid":"28169797","pubdate":"2016-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"title":"The lived experiences of street children in Durban, South Africa: Violence, substance use, and resilience","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lived-experiences-street-children-durban-south-africa-violence-substance-resilience"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.25,"score_history":{"1y":3.2,"6m":3.2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":1334160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6920917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271695,"mean":11.555824979572,"rank":60857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":210620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271695,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":397,"mean":2.4113080808081,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":397,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.4985294117647,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":12}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
