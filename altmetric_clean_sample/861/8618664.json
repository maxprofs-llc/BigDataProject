Removal of the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-shell at the appropriate time through tumor-microenvironment triggers could be a feasible solution to this problem. Here, paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded mixed micelles (PTX-mM) self-assembled from stearate-modified hyaluronic acid (SHA), mPEG-b-poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (mPEG-b-PAE), and ethylene acetyl-b-poly(\u03b2-amino ester)(EA-b-PAE) were developed. In the preparation of PTX-mM, SHA micelles were coated with EA-b-PAE followed by co-loading of PTX and mPEG-b-PAE. PTX-mM were capable of extracellular pH-triggered PEG-detachment, and poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PAE)-mediated endosomal escape. When the pH was changed from pH 7.4 to pH 6.8, the particle size of PTX-mM significantly decreased from 97.5 \u00b1 4.4 nm to 71.5 \u00b1 2.3 nm. It also resulted in rapid and complete release of mPEG-b-PAE from PTX-mM as monitored using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technology. PTX-mM capable of PEG detachment provided significant enhancement of PTX accumulation in SKOV-3cells compared to PEG non-detachable PTX-mM. Interestingly, intracellular transport studies using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that EA-b-PAE could promote the escape of micelles from endo-lysosomes. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of PTX-mM against SKOV-3 cells was 5.7 \u03bcg\/mL, and PTX-mM containing 20 \u03bcg\/mL of PTX induced apoptosis in 53.0% of the cell population. PTX-mM exhibited a highly prolonged elimination half-life (t1\/2, 2.83 \u00b1 0.37 h) and improved area under the curve (AUC, 7724.82 \u00b1 1190.75 ng\/mL\/h) than the PTX-loaded SHA micelles (PTX-M). Furthermore, PTX-mM showed the highest tumor inhibition rate (64.9%) and the longest survival time (53 days) against the SKOV-3 ovarian cancer xenograft models among all formulations. Taken together, the results suggested that PTX-mM have potential as an efficient anticancer formulation in treatment of ovarian cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c9","authors":["Zhao, Haijun","Li, Qian","Hong, Zehui"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00164","first_seen_on":"2016-06-09T21:34:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1543-8392","1543-8384"],"journal":"Molecular Pharmaceutics","last_mentioned_on":1465508013,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27266442?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27266442","pubdate":"2016-06-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Paclitaxel-loaded mixed micelles enhance ovarian cancer therapy through extracellular pH-triggered PEG detachment and endosomal escape","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paclitaxelloaded-mixed-micelles-enhance-ovarian-cancer-therapy-through-extracellular-phtriggered-peg"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7876706,"mean":6.669712343671,"rank":6821064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7876706,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268679,"mean":11.392823647637,"rank":223938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268679,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1123,"mean":5.1599643493761,"rank":976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1123,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":16.149741935484,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
