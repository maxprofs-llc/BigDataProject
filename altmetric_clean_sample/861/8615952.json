Because of their vast knowledge of health and healing, and their proximity to patients' bedsides, nurses are often well positioned to advocate for healthcare reform and legislation to improve end-of-life care. This article provides an overview of the social, economic, and political factors that are shaping end-of-life care in the United States. First, historical perspectives on end-of-life care are presented to enhance understanding of why some clinicians and patients seem to resist change to current practices. Second, end of care issues related to advanced technology utilization, societal expectations of care, clinical practices, financial incentives, palliative care services, and policy reforms are discussed. Finally, future recommendations are provided to encourage nurses and other healthcare providers to improve care for individuals facing end-of-life care decisions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003359","authors":["Janet Sopcheck"],"doi":"10.1177\/1527154416642664","first_seen_on":"2016-06-09T19:11:00+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1552-7468"],"journal":"Policy, Politics & Nursing Practice","last_mentioned_on":1465577032,"links":["http:\/\/ppn.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/05\/04\/1527154416642664.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ppn.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/05\/04\/1527154416642664.full.pdf","pmid":"27151834","pubdate":"2016-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","publichealth"],"title":"Social, Economic, and Political Issues Affecting End-of-Life Care","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/social-economic-political-issues-affecting-endoflife-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":4129487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2196818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268688,"mean":11.394320350445,"rank":145619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268688,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":3.8530107526882,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.05,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"PG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrMroz\/statuses\/740984477179121669","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8615952],"posted_on":"2016-06-09T19:10:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Larry Mroz","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Lawrence_Larry_Mroz","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/539112786467364865\/QCqlxZRL_normal.jpeg","description":"Social Mediaist @BCC4PC; @HeardUBC; Researcher School of Nursing, UBC; #MensHealth #AdvanceCarePlanning #ProstateCancer Google Scholar:  https:\/\/t.co\/WicG7UoDx6","id_on_source":"DrMroz","tweeter_id":"391702198","geo":{"lt":49.24966,"ln":-123.11934,"country":"CA"},"followers":1965},"tweet_id":"740984477179121669"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BCC4PC\/statuses\/741296520717275136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8615952],"posted_on":"2016-06-10T15:50:37+00:00","author":{"name":"BCC Palliative Care","url":"http:\/\/bc-cpc.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/905539797455781888\/5Pj3tGtQ_normal.jpg","description":"BC Centre for Palliative Care: Education, evidence-based practice & policy development; research, better care, community.","id_on_source":"BCC4PC","tweeter_id":"2525771683","geo":{"lt":-6,"ln":147,"country":"PG"},"followers":3432},"tweet_id":"741296520717275136"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/_iPANEL_\/statuses\/741309921333903360","license":"gnip","rt":["BCC4PC"],"citation_ids":[8615952],"posted_on":"2016-06-10T16:43:52+00:00","author":{"name":"iPANEL","url":"http:\/\/www.ipanel.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2726543761\/4d80d5b2adaa104dd579aa5b7566abcb_normal.jpeg","description":"Initiative for a Palliative Approach in Nursing: Evidence & Leadership.
