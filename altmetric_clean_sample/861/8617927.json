Herein, we demonstrate an optical 'turn-on' biosensor for the detection of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), fabricated by means of a peptide-induced assembly of fluorescent graphene oxide (GO). Functionalization of GO with a peptide substrate for MMP-2 bearing a thiol group leads to its self-assembly via disulfide bonding, accompanied by self-quenching of GO's strong fluorescence. This peptide-induced GO assembly is then disassembled by proteolytic cleavage in the presence of MMP-2, thereby restoring the level of self-quenched GO fluorescence. With this approach, we are able to detect MMP-2 and to investigate the kinetic parameters of MMP-2 activity. The GO-peptide assembly is successfully applied to the selective and sensitive detection of MMP-2 secreted by living cells, human hepatocytes HepG2, at a concentration of 2 ng mL(-1).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823d","authors":["Yang, Jin-Kyoung","Kwak, Seon-Yeong","Jeon, Su-Ji","Lee, Eunjin","Ju, Jong-Min","Kim, Hye-In","Lee, Yoon-Sik","Kim, Jong-Ho"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6nr02815b","first_seen_on":"2016-06-09T20:51:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2040-3372","2040-3364"],"issue":"24","journal":"Nanoscale","last_mentioned_on":1465511433,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27271225?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27271225","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Proteolytic disassembly of peptide-mediated graphene oxide assemblies for turn-on fluorescence sensing of proteases","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteolytic-disassembly-peptidemediated-graphene-oxide-assemblies-turnon-fluorescence-sensing-protea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7876706,"mean":6.669712343671,"rank":5693137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1902851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7876706,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268680,"mean":11.392783849872,"rank":172351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268680,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2110,"mean":4.5702048364154,"rank":1169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2110,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":9.15746875,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
