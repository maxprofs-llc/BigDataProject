Currently described AMGs encompass a wide variety of metabolic functions, including amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, energy production, and iron-sulfur cluster assembly and modification, and their community-wide gene content and abundance vary as a function of environmental conditions. Here, we describe different AMGs classes, their hypothesized role in redirecting host carbon metabolism, and their ecological importance. Focusing on metagenomic ocean surveys, we propose a new model where a suite of phage-encoded genes activate host pathways that respond rapidly to environmental cues, presumably resulting in rapid changes to host metabolic flux for phage production.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a5","authors":["Bonnie L Hurwitz","Jana M U\u2019Ren","Hurwitz, Bonnie L","U'Ren, Jana M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mib.2016.04.002","endpage":"168","first_seen_on":"2016-04-18T18:40:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["13695274","1879-0364"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1500940800,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1369527416300376","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27088500?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.mib.2016.04.002"],"pmid":"27088500","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"161","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Viral metabolic reprogramming in marine ecosystems","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/viral-metabolic-reprogramming-marine-ecosystems"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.83,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.83},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266541,"mean":6.9778542507441,"rank":784218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7482233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266541,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272983,"mean":11.500603058077,"rank":37175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":235771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272983,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":856,"mean":5.4670783625731,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":856,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":12.647944444444,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
