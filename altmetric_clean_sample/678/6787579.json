RCSB PDB has developed the program DCC to allow worldwide PDB (wwPDB; http:\/\/wwpdb.org) biocurators, using a single command-line program, to invoke a number of third-party software packages to compare the model file with the experimental data. DCC functionality includes structure factor validation, electron-density map generation and slicing, local electron-density analysis, and residual B factor analysis. DCC outputs a summary containing various crystallographic statistics in PDBx\/mmCIF format for use in automatic data processing and archiving pipelines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8d","authors":["Yang, H.","Yang, H.","Peisach, E.","Westbrook, J.D.","Young, J.","Berman, H.M.","Burley, S.K."],"doi":"10.1107\/s1600576716004428","first_seen_on":"2016-04-19T00:00:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-5767","0021-8898"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Applied Crystallography (Wiley-Blackwell)","last_mentioned_on":1461024002,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S1600576716004428"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/j\/issues\/2016\/03\/00\/ap5001\/ap5001.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4886994","pmid":"27275151","pubdate":"2016-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"\n              DCC\n              : a Swiss army knife for structure factor analysis and validation\n            ","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dcc-swiss-army-knife-structure-factor-analysis-validation-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":5726374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1013018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267916,"mean":11.282525935464,"rank":187482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267916,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":977,"mean":1.5791700819672,"rank":329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":977,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":0.96363636363636,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
