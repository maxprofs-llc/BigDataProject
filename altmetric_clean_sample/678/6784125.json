Cyclobutenes are formed as the exclusive products in MeOH in the presence of H2 O and Et3 N, whereas the use of AcOH leads to alkenylboron compounds. Both reactions showed a broad substrate scope and good tolerance for various functional groups, including carboxylic acid ester, free hydroxy, imide, and alkyl groups. Furthermore, transformations of the borylated products were conducted to show their potential applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Qiu, Youai","Yang, Bin","Zhu, Can","B\u00e4ckvall, Jan\u2010E."],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201601613","endpage":"6524","first_seen_on":"2016-04-18T19:15:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"22","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
