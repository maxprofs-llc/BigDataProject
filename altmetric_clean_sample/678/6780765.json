Despite the relevance of drought stress, changes in physiology and resistance mechanisms are not completely understood for certain crops, including hop (Humulus lupulus L.). In this research the drought response of hop was studied using a conventional physiological approach (gas exchange techniques, fluorescence, relative water content measurements) and proteomic analysis (2D-DIGE). Plants of two cultivars (Aurora and Savinjski golding) were exposed to progressive drought in a pot experiment and analysed at different stress stages (mild, moderate and severe). Measurements of relative water content revealed a hydrostable water balance of hop. Photosynthesis was decreased due to stomatal and non-stomatal limitation to the same extent in both cultivars. Of 28 identified differentially abundant proteins, the majority were down regulated and included in photosynthetic (41%) and sugar metabolism (33%). Fifteen % of identified proteins were classified into the nitrogen metabolism, 4% were related to a ROS related pathway and 7% to other functions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333c","authors":["Kolenc, Zala","Vodnik, Dominik","Mandelc, Stanislav","Javornik, Branka","Kastelec, Damijana","\u010cerenak, Andreja"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.plaphy.2016.03.026","endpage":"78","first_seen_on":"2016-04-18T16:27:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2690","09819428"],"journal":"Plant Physiology & Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1460984599,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27085598?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27085598","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Soil Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"67","subjects":["botany","biochemistry"],"title":"Hop (Humulus lupulus L.) response mechanisms in drought stress: Proteomic analysis with physiology","type":"article","volume":"105","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hop-humulus-lupulus-l-response-mechanisms-drought-stress-proteomic-analysis-physiology-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":6552477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267505,"mean":11.32985824511,"rank":224466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267505,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":623,"mean":1.0014083601286,"rank":363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":623,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.94565217391304,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
