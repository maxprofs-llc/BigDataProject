The cationic lipid di-oleoyl trimethylammonium propane, DOTAP, and the oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, sodium poly(acrylic acid) and sodium poly(styrene sulfonate), form multilamellar complexes in water. Due to the different molecular stiffness of the two polyelectrolytes, they form different nanostructured complexes. Also, because of different ionization behavior of the two polyelectrolytes, pH affects differently the complexation of the polyelectrolytes with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), another cationic surfactant. We used cryogenic temperature transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to compare the nanostructures formed. Our results show that although the basic nanostructures of the complexes are always lamellar (multilamellar or unilamellar), the morphology of the complexes is affected by the polyelectrolyte rigidity and the solution pH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Maor Ram-On"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpcb.6b01138","first_seen_on":"2016-04-18T18:46:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5207","1520-6106"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1460998422,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpcb.6b01138"],"pmid":"27049758","pubdate":"2016-04-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Effect of Polyelectrolyte Stiffness and Solution pH on the Nanostructure of Complexes Formed by Cationic Amphiphiles and Negatively Charged Polyelectrolytes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-polyelectrolyte-stiffness-solution-ph-nanostructure-complexes-formed-cationic-amphiphiles-neg"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":6552483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267504,"mean":11.329859478211,"rank":224468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267504,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3641,"mean":1.7598307692308,"rank":2317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3641,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182,"mean":3.4484861878453,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
