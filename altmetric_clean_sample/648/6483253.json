Additionally, at a more local scale the spreading of hypoxic conditions is promoted by eutrophication and warming. In the semi-enclosed brackish Baltic Sea, occasional upwelling in late summer and autumn may expose even shallow-water communities including the macroalga Fucus vesiculosus to particularly acidified, nutrient-rich and oxygen-poor water bodies. During summer 2014 (July-September) sibling groups of early life-stage F. vesiculosus were exposed to OAW in the presence and absence of enhanced nutrient levels and, subsequently to a single upwelling event in a near-natural scenario which included all environmental fluctuations in the Kiel Fjord, southwestern Baltic Sea, Germany (54\u00b027 \u00b4N, 10\u00b011 \u00b4W). We strove to elucidate the single and combined impacts of these potential stressors, and how stress sensitivity varies among genetically different sibling groups. Enhanced by a circumstantial natural heat wave, warming and acidification increased mortalities and reduced growth in F. vesiculosus germlings. This impact, however, was mitigated by enhanced nutrient conditions. Survival under OAW conditions strongly varied among sibling groups hinting at a substantial adaptive potential of the natural Fucus populations in the Western Baltic. A three-day experimental upwelling caused severe mortality of Fucus germlings, which was substantially more severe in those sibling groups which previously had been exposed to OAW. Our results show that global (OAW), regional (nutrient enrichment) and local pressures (upwelling), both alone and co-occurring may have synergistic and antagonistic effects on survival and\/or growth of Fucus germlings. This result emphasizes the need to consider combined stress effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Al-Janabi, Balsam","Kruse, Inken","Graiff, Angelika","Winde, Vera","Lenz, Mark","Wahl, Martin","Balsam Al-Janabi","Inken Kruse","Angelika Graiff","Vera Winde","Mark Lenz","Martin Wahl"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0152948","first_seen_on":"2016-04-05T15:37:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1460450100,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27043710?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0152948","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0152948"],"pmid":"27043710","pubdate":"2016-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0152948","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Buffering and Amplifying Interactions among OAW (Ocean Acidification & Warming) and Nutrient Enrichment on Early Life-Stage Fucus vesiculosus L.
