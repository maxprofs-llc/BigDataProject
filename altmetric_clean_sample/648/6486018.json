The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of indocyanine green (ICG) imaging in identifying and assessing perfusion of PGs during TT.\nICG was administered in patients undergoing TT and fluorescence of PGs was assessed. A grading scale was developed for assessing degree of ICG uptake. Patients were evaluated for hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism on post-operative day (POD) #1.\nTwenty-seven patients underwent TT with ICG imaging for multinodular goiter (n\u2009=\u200913), thyroid cancer (n\u2009=\u200910), and Graves' disease (n\u2009=\u20094). Eight-five PGs were identified visually, 71 (84%) of which showed ICG fluorescence. False negative rate was 6%. Post-operatively, three patients (11%) had a serum calcium value <8\u2009mg\/dl. ICG uptake after TT correlated with post-operative PTH levels: mean POD#1 PTH of those patients with at least two PGs exhibiting <30% fluorescence was 9\u2009pg\/ml; whereas those with fewer than two demonstrating <30% fluorescence had a POD#1 PTH of 19.5\u2009pg\/ml (P\u2009=\u20090.05).\nICG imaging of PGs during TT is feasible. ICG might be a useful adjunct in identifying those patients at risk for post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. J. Surg.
