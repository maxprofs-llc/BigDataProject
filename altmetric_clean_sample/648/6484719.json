With the introduction of biologic therapies during the last decade and with new treatments constantly emerging, there is a great need to validate biomarkers that have been reported to be associated with treatment response, and to introduce new biomarkers of possible clinical value.\nIn the current study, we aimed to investigate the association of psoriasis-related polymorphisms that have previously been reported to effect the anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-\u03b1) therapies (etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab) and anti-interleukin-12\/23 (anti-IL-12\/23) biologic therapy (ustekinumab) in a Greek cohort of psoriasis patients.\nRs10484554 in the HLA-C gene showed an association with a good response to anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents but not to ustekinumab, while rs151823 and rs26653 in the ERAP1 gene showed associations with a good response to anti-IL-12\/23 therapy.\nThis study is the first in the field of pharmacogenetics in Greek psoriasis patients. Further, larger studies are required to validate our findings and replicate them in various populations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037bb","authors":["Sofia Masouri","Irene Stefanaki","Giorgos Ntritsos","Katerina P.
