The Remote Sensing and Signaling Hypothesis (Nigam S. What do drug transporters really do? Nat Rev Drug Discov 2015; 14: 29-44) suggests that multispecific solute carrier (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transporters in different tissues are part of an inter-organ communication system that maintains levels of urate and other metabolites after organ injury.\nData from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC; n = 3598) were used to study associations between serum uric acid and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the following uric acid transporters: ABCG2 (BRCP), SLC22A6 (OAT1), SLC22A8 (OAT3), SLC22A10 (OAT5), SLC22A11 (OAT4), SLC22A12 (URAT1), SLC22A13 (OAT10), SLC17A1-A3 (NPTs), SLC2A9 (GLUT9), ABCC2 (MRP2) and ABCC4 (MRP4). Regression models, controlling for principal components age, gender and renal function, were run separately for those of European (EA) and African ancestry (AA), and P-values corrected for multiple comparisons. A twin cohort with participants of EA and normal renal function was used for comparison.\nAmong those of EA in CRIC, statistically significant signals were observed for SNPs in ABCG2 (rs4148157; beta-coefficient = 0.68; P = 4.78E-13) and SNPs in SLC2A9 (rs13125646; beta-coefficient = -0.30; P = 1.06E-5). Among those of AA, the strongest (but not statistically significant) signals were observed for SNPs in SLC2A9, followed by SNPs in ABCG2. In the twin study (normal renal function), only SNPs in SLC2A9 were significant (rs4481233; beta-coefficient=-0.45; P = 7.0E-6). In CRIC, weaker associations were also found for SLC17A3 (NPT4) and gender-specific associations found for SLC22A8 (OAT3), SLC22A11 (OAT4), and ABCC4 (MRP4).\nIn patients of EA with CKD (CRIC cohort), we found striking associations between uric acid and SNPs on ABCG2, a key transporter of uric acid by intestine. Compared with ABCG2, SLC2A9 played a much less significant role in this subset of patients with CKD. SNPs in other SLC (e.g. SLC22A8 or OAT3) and ABC (e.g. ABCC4 or MRP4) genes appear to make a weak gender-dependent contribution to uric acid homeostasis in CKD. As renal urate transport is affected in the setting of declining kidney function, extra-renal ABCG2 appears to play a compensatory role-a notion consistent with animal studies and the Remote Sensing and Signaling Hypothesis. Overall, the data indicate how different urate transporters become more or less important depending on renal function, ethnicity and gender. Therapies focused on enhancing ABCG2 urate handling may be helpful in the setting of CKD and hyperuricemia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7ed3cf058f61000b622","authors":["Vibha Bhatnagar","Erin L.
