The symptoms may be broadly separated into those associated with the disease process and those that represent adverse effects of treatment. Symptoms attributed to the disease arise from pathologic changes within multiple brain regions and are not restricted to dysfunction in the dopaminergic system. Mood symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and apathy are common and may precede the development of motor symptoms by years, while other neuropsychiatric symptoms such as cognitive impairment, dementia, and psychosis are more common in later stages of the disease. Neuropsychiatric symptoms attributed to treatment include impulse control disorders, pathologic use of dopaminergic medications, and psychosis. This manuscript will review the current understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's Disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007063","authors":["Jeffrey W.
