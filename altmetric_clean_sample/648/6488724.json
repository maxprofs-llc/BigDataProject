PWD inflicts significant damages in Eurasian pine forests. Symbiotic microorganisms have a large influence in insect survival. The aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community associated to PWD vectors in Europe and East Asia using a culture-independent approach. Twenty-three Monochamus galloprovincialis were collected in Portugal (two different locations); twelve Monochamus alternatus were collected in Japan. DNA was extracted from the insects' tracheas for 16S rDNA analysis through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and barcoded pyrosequencing. Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonadales, Vibrionales and Oceanospirilales were present in all samples. Enterobacteriaceae was represented by 52.2% of the total number of reads. Twenty-three OTUs were present in all locations. Significant differences existed between the microbiomes of the two insect species while for M. galloprovincialis there were no significant differences between samples from different Portuguese locations. This study presents a detailed description of the bacterial community colonizing the Monochamus insects' tracheas. Several of the identified bacterial groups were described previously in association with pine trees and B. xylophilus, and their previously described functions suggest that they may play a relevant role in PWD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Marta Alves","Anabela Pereira","Patr\u00edcia Matos","Joana Henriques","Cl\u00e1udia Vicente","Takuya Aikawa","Koichi Hasegawa","Francisco Nascimento","Manuel Mota","Ant\u00f3nio Correia","Isabel Henriques","Alves, Marta","Pereira, Anabela","Matos, Patr\u00edcia","Henriques, Joana","Vicente, Cl\u00e1udia","Aikawa, Takuya","Hasegawa, Koichi","Nascimento, Francisco","Mota, Manuel","Correia, Ant\u00f3nio","Henriques, Isabel"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep23908","first_seen_on":"2016-04-05T23:20:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1490878748,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep23908?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+srep\/rss\/current+(Scientific+Reports)","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27045340?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep23908","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27045340?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/srep23908"],"pmid":"27045340","pubdate":"2016-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiome","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Plant sciences","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"23908","subjects":["science"],"title":"Bacterial community associated to the pine wilt disease insect vectors Monochamus galloprovincialis and Monochamus alternatus","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep23908","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bacterial-community-associated-pine-wilt-disease-insect-vectors-monochamus-galloprovincialis-monocha"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.08,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":977400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7457088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278885,"mean":11.442149804219,"rank":47284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":231426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278885,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37708,"mean":14.743490280319,"rank":7768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":29919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37708,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2832,"mean":16.5493832568,"rank":663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":2166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2832,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
