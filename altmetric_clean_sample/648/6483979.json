With chelating P,N-ligands cationic six- or five-membered chelate complexes were isolated in the form of salts with weakly coordinating counter anions that were brought in from the diazonium salt. With monodentate P ligands or N-heterocyclic carbene ligands and diazonium chlorides neutral arylgold(iii) dichloro complexes were obtained. The coordination geometry was determined by X-ray crystal structure analyses of representative compounds, a cis arrangement of the aryl and the phosphane ligand at the square planar gold(iii) center is observed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Long Huang","Frank - Rominger","Matthias Rudolph","Stephen Hashmi","Frank Rominger","A.
