In this work we explore the J774A.1 mouse macrophage cell line response and microRNA (miRNA) expression during infection with the most relevant mycobacterial strains for human (M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, and M. bovis BCG). No significant differences in bacillary loads were observed between activate and naive macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. Nitrite production inhibition and infection control were in concordance with the virulence of strain. The expression of let-7e, miR-21, miR-155, miR-210, and miR-223 was opposite for both species, and the miR-146b* and miR-1224 expression seem to be part of the general response to infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62d3cf058f610008186","authors":["Elizabeth, Mendoza-Coronel","de la Cruz Olga Nohem\u00ed, Hern\u00e1ndez","Mauricio, Casta\u00f1\u00f3n-Arreola"],"doi":"10.1111\/1348-0421.12380","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-04-06T01:14:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1348-0421"],"journal":"Microbiology and Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1459905245,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27041510?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27041510","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["microbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"\n              Infection of J774A.1 with different\n              Mycobacterium\n              species induces differential immune and miRNA-related responses\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/infection-j774a1-different-mycobacterium-species-induces-differential-immune-mirnarelated-responses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7506617,"mean":6.4985319251666,"rank":6502238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7506617,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271020,"mean":11.224045155505,"rank":229053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271020,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":329,"mean":2.9783414634146,"rank":275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":329,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":7.146,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
