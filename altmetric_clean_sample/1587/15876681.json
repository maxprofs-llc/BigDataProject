Eighteen elite rugby league players were recruited. A time-motion model was used to estimate the energy expenditure and metabolic demands of rugby league match-play utilizing Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. This approach utilizes players' GPS velocity-time curves to examine running velocity. Players were categorized into positional groups (outside backs, adjustables, wide-running and hit-up forwards) and then further categorized into full-match or interchange players. Compared to their full-match counterparts, interchange wide-running forwards expended greater energy (43.1\u00b16.1 vs 28.6\u00b17.5 kJ\u00b7kg, p\u2264 0.001, ES=-2.38) and produced a higher anaerobic index (p=0.016, ES=0.56) and mean power (7.4%, p=0.003, ES=0.66) per match. Full-match adjustables expended 94.8% more energy (p\u2264 0.001, ES=-2.3) and performed more moderate accelerations (10.1%, p=0.014, ES=-0.57) and decelerations (7.6%, p=0.017, ES=-0.8), than their interchange counterparts. Outside backs did not interchange and hit-up forwards rarely (n=2) played an entire match. Differing metabolic demands were identified for interchange and full-match players across positional groups, suggesting position specific conditioning drills are required to model the energetic demands of match-play.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Cummins, Cloe","Gray, Adrian","Shorter, Kathleen","Halaki, Mark","Orr, Rhonda"],"doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0000000000001801","first_seen_on":"2017-01-27T18:57:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1064-8011","1533-4287"],"journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1485601957,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Energetic_demands_of_interchange_and_full_match.96166.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/9000\/00000\/Energetic_demands_of_interchange_and_full_match.96166.pdf","pmid":"28135224","pubdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Energetic demands of interchange and full-match rugby league players.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Energetic_demands_of_interchange_and_full_match.96166.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/energetic-demands-interchange-fullmatch-rugby-league-players"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":4.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":1734910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6392405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261909,"mean":12.778187126777,"rank":78351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":182858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261909,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3822,"mean":16.280645904214,"rank":2223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3822,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":9.0095575221239,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":4,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mike_mcguigan\/statuses\/825055102108983296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15876681],"posted_on":"2017-01-27T18:57:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Mike McGuigan","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/VqpmcT0wq7","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439174555681042432\/Z-uoqFNV_normal.jpeg","description":"Professor, Sports Performance Research Institute NZ @SPRINZ_AUT @AUTuni","id_on_source":"mike_mcguigan","tweeter_id":"245066121","followers":5153},"tweet_id":"825055102108983296"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Nick_Dobbin\/statuses\/825061372417409024","license":"gnip","rt":["mike_mcguigan"],"citation_ids":[15876681],"posted_on":"2017-01-27T19:22:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Nick Dobbin","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/788384940635357184\/p3h-R7hr_normal.jpg","description":"PhD Student in Exercise Physiology | MRes in Physiology | BSc (Hons) Sport and Exercise Science and Biology | Lead Sport Scientist for England Touch Association","id_on_source":"Nick_Dobbin","tweeter_id":"1556442733","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"},"followers":208},"tweet_id":"825061372417409024"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CloeCummins\/statuses\/825071467620507648","license":"gnip","rt":["mike_mcguigan"],"citation_ids":[15876681],"posted_on":"2017-01-27T20:02:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Cloe Cummins","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489976681747062786\/Xj5hzRT9_normal.jpeg","description":"Lecturer in Exercise and Sports Science -
