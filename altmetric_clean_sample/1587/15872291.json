While the main trigger of RAR activation is the binding of RA, phosphorylation of the receptors has also emerged as an important regulatory signal. Phosphorylation of the RAR\u03b3 N-terminal domain (NTD) is known to play a functional role in neuronal differentiation. In this work, we investigated the phosphorylation of RAR\u03b3 ligand binding domain (LBD), and present evidence that the phosphorylation status of the LBD affects the phosphorylation of the NTD region. We solved the X-ray structure of a phospho-mimetic mutant of the LBD (RAR\u03b3 S371E), which we used in molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the consequences of the S371E mutation on the RAR\u03b3 structural dynamics. Combined with simulations of the wild-type LBD, we show that the conformational equilibria of LBD salt bridges (notably R387-D340) are affected by the S371E mutation, which likely affects the recruitment of the kinase complex that phosphorylates the NTD. The molecular dynamics simulations also showed that a conservative mutation in this salt bridge (R387K) affects the dynamics of the LBD without inducing large conformational changes. Finally, cellular assays showed that the phosphorylation of the NTD of RAR\u03b3 is differentially regulated by retinoic acid in RAR\u03b3WT and in the S371N, S371E and R387K mutants. This multidisciplinary work highlights an allosteric coupling between phosphorylations of the LBD and the NTD of RAR\u03b3 and supports the importance of structural dynamics involving electrostatic interactions in the regulation of RARs activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yassmine Chebaro","Serena Sirigu","Ismail Amal","R\u00e9gis Lutzing","Roland H.
