Financial regulators are increasingly expected to rationalize proposed rules using available econometric techniques, and the courts have vacated several key rules emanating from Dodd-Frank on the grounds of alleged deficiencies in this evidentiary effort. The turn toward such econometric tools is seen as a significant constraint on and challenge to regulators as they endeavor to engage with such essential policy questions as the impact of financial speculation on food security. Yet, outside of the specialized practitioner community, very little is known about these techniques. This article examines one such econometric test, Granger causality, and its role in a pivotal Dodd-Frank rulemaking. Through an examination of the test for Granger causality and its attempts to distill the causal connections between financial speculation and commodities prices, the article argues that econometrics is a blunt but useful tool, limited in its ability to provide decisive insights into commodities markets and yet yielding useful returns for those who are able to wield it.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001fab","authors":["James W Williams","Nikolai M Cook"],"doi":"10.1177\/0306312716658980","first_seen_on":"2016-08-20T04:12:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1460-3659","0306-3127"],"issue":"5","journal":"Social Studies of Science (Sage Publications, Ltd.)","last_mentioned_on":1475940835,"links":["http:\/\/sss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/07\/21\/0306312716658980.abstract?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/sss.sagepub.com\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/46\/5\/701?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/sss.sagepub.com\/content\/46\/5\/701"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/sss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/07\/21\/0306312716658980.full.pdf","pmid":"28948880","pubdate":"2016-08-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["socialsciences","historyofmedicine"],"title":"Econometrics as evidence?
