However, a molecular understanding of GSL-rich membranes in terms of their clustered organization, stability, and dynamics is still elusive. To gain molecular insight into the organization and dynamics of GSL-rich membranes, we performed all-atom molecular-dynamics simulations of bicomponent ganglioside GM1 in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) phospholipid bilayers with varying concentrations of GM1 (10%, 20%, and 30%). Overall, the simulations show very good agreement with available experimental data, including x-ray electron density profiles along the membrane normal, NMR carbohydrate proton-proton distances, and x-ray crystal structures. This validates the quality of our model systems for investigating GM1 clustering through an ordered-lipid-cluster analysis. The increase in GM1 concentration induces tighter lipid packing, driven mainly by inter-GM1 carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions, leading to a greater preference for the positive curvature of GM1-containing membranes and larger cluster sizes of ordered-lipid clusters (with a composite of GM1 and POPC). These clusters tend to segregate and form a large percolated cluster at a 30% GM1 concentration at 293\u00a0K. At a higher temperature of 330\u00a0K, however, the segregation is not maintained.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["Patel, Dhilon S","Park, Soohyung","Wu, Emilia L","Yeom, Min Sun","Widmalm, G\u00f6ran","Klauda, Jeffery B","Im, Wonpil","Dhilon\u00a0S.
