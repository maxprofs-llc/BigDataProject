The military is grounded in the principles and practice of conducting violent operations, and the psychology of violence fundamentally anchors its professionalism. The occurrence of unwanted violence and tragic incidence of suicides, homicides, and abuse expose the challenges to containing the behavior outside of the combat and training theaters.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c69","authors":["Stephen N.
