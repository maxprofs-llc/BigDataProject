The recent characterization of genes encoding molecular components of the VNO sensory response suggests that VNO neurons express a unique set of molecules to recognize and translate pheromone signals into neuronal electrical activity. Identification of these genes, which include putative pheromone receptor genes, has offered a new opportunity to uncover basic principles of pheromone sensory processing and important aspects of vomeronasal development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a6","authors":["Dulac, C"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0959-4388(00)00121-5","endpage":"518","first_seen_on":"2016-11-09T08:48:24+00:00","issns":["0959-4388","09594388"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Opinion in Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1478657820,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0959438800001215"],"pmid":"10981622","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"511","subjects":["biology","neurology"],"title":"Sensory coding of pheromone signals in mammals","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sensory-coding-pheromone-signals-mammals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7667486,"mean":6.5863981409766,"rank":1392496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6257586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7667486,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232191,"mean":12.97452690469,"rank":61406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":168726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232191,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":993,"mean":4.6056471774194,"rank":233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":993,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":5.8337837837838,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
