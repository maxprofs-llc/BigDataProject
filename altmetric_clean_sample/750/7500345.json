The purpose of this study was to investigate prevalence of anemia among US Air Force (USAF) basic trainees, to compare physical performance and discharge rates between anemic and non-anemic trainees, and to determine the risks and relative risks of being discharged for anemic versus non-anemic women and men.\nAll USAF basic trainees were screened for anemia between July 2013 and January 2014, during an 8-week basic training course at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, TX. Age, sex, screening hemoglobin, anthropometric measurements, initial\/final physical fitness assessment scores, and discharge data were collected from trainees. Those identified as anemic (hemoglobin <13.5\u00a0g\/dL for males and <12.0\u00a0g\/dL for females) received additional labwork, nutritional counseling, and oral iron-replacement, if indicated. Mean percent improvement was calculated for all performance parameters from beginning to end of training. Anemic trainees were compared to non-anemic trainees by t test with Welch modification. Results were stratified by sex and anemia severity with post-hoc Bonferroni correction.\nPrevalence of anemia was 12.6\u00a0% (N\u2009=\u200918,827). Respective prevalence of borderline, moderate, and severe anemia was 12.6, 10.9, and 1.9\u00a0% for females and 4.8, 3.8, and 0.3\u00a0% for males. Mean 1.5-mile run-time, push-up and sit-up counts improved from beginning to end of training for both anemic and non-anemic trainees (p\u2009<\u20090.001 both). Non-anemic trainees had slightly greater run-time improvements than borderline and moderate anemics (female: 17.7 vs. 15.2, and 15.1\u00a0% improvement, p\u2009<\u20090.05 both; male: 14.9 vs. 13.2, and 13.5\u00a0% improvement, p\u2009<\u20090.05 both). One-way ANOVA demonstrated statistically significant differences between initial and final fitness data for all measures and both genders (p\u2009<\u20090.001) with the exception of final sit-up counts for male trainees (p\u2009=\u20090.082). Discharge rate for anemic trainees was 9.0\u00a0% (20\u00a0% for severely anemic trainees) as compared to 5.7\u00a0% for non-anemics.\nAnemia was prevalent among USAF basic trainees. Identification and treatment of anemia may optimize physical performance and decrease the rate of medical discharge.","altmetric_jid":"54e78aa82a83ee4e3d8b4579","authors":["Kathryn E.
