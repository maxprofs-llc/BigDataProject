From Genetics to Clinical Practice. - NCBI"],"citation":{"abstract":"Elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is an important cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Over the years, clinical outcome studies with LDL-C lowering agents have revealed that reducing LCL-C levels is effective in reducing rates of major ASCVD events. Although secondary factors play a role in clinical expression, severe lipid disorders often have a strong genetic component. Genetic revelations have provided novel targets for improving LDL-C management in high-risk individuals. Most recently, researchers have explored how the inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) alters LDL metabolism and lowers LDL-C levels to achieve lipid goals and potentially reduce ASCVD risk in patients with severe lipid disorders, including familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). This CMHC Spotlight article summarizes the clinical evidence demonstrating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors in lowering LDL-C levels. Reductions in LDL-C levels by PCSK9 inhibitors alone in patients who are statin intolerant or combined with maximally tolerated statins in patients with severe lipid disorders demonstrate the potential for reduced morbidity and mortality associated with ASCVD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c40","authors":["Sabatine, Marc S","Underberg, James A","Koren, Michael","Baum, Seth J"],"doi":"10.1080\/00325481.2016.1208895","endpage":"39","first_seen_on":"2016-07-22T21:17:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1941-9260","0032-5481"],"issue":"sup1","journal":"Postgraduate Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1480514333,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27422124?dopt=Citation","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27422124"],"pmid":"27422124","pubdate":"2016-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"31","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Focus on PCSK9 Inhibitors: From Genetics to Clinical Practice","type":"article","volume":"128","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/focus-pcsk9-inhibitors-genetics-clinical-practice-highlights-cme-symposium-held-cardiometabolic-heal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7826281,"mean":6.6353071855279,"rank":3323279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4391448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7826281,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254856,"mean":11.794158709854,"rank":102819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":147285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254856,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":606,"mean":4.1543801652893,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":606,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":3.3046875,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"TG":1},"mendeley":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drpablocorral\/statuses\/756599032449994752","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9960639],"posted_on":"2016-07-22T21:17:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Pablo Corral MD","url":"http:\/\/www.icm-mdp.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489159168230965248\/wnyBRixn_normal.jpeg","description":"Internal Medicine Doctor.
