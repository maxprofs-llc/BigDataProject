The production of IgG autoantibodies is critically dependent on cellular immune mechanisms particularly relating to T cells. We review the recent literature of the cell-mediated immunology of AITP focusing on platelet phenotype, genetics, T-cell reactivities, and cytokine profiles in patients with AITP. Understanding the interaction between these cell-mediated mechanisms is vital for developing antigen specific immunotherapies to treat this autoimmune disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005d25","authors":["Coopamah, Malini D","Garvey, M Bernadette","Freedman, John","Semple, John W"],"doi":"10.1053\/tmrv.2003.50004","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T15:23:58+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0887-7963"],"issue":"1","journal":"Transfusion Medicine Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1171499442,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1053\/tmrv.2003.50004","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12522773"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.tmreviews.com\/article\/S0887796303800068\/pdf","pmid":"12522773","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Cellular immune mechanisms in autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura: An update.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cellular-immune-mechanisms-autoimmune-thrombocytopenic-purpura-update"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":816568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94093,"mean":8.1186462185948,"rank":24501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94093,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":2.9891153846154,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
