Impacts ejected basaltic rocks that probably were part of locally formed lava flows from at least 10 meters depth. Some rocks have been textured and\/or partially buried by windblown sediments less than 2 millimeters in diameter that concentrate within shallow, partially filled, circular impact depressions referred to as hollows. The terrain traversed during the 90-sol (martian solar day) nominal mission shows no evidence for an ancient lake in Gusev crater.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2004Sci...305..807G","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["J.
