Because Hct determines the viscosity of blood, it may affect the spreading of blood onto the filter paper. Hence, accurate quantitative data can only be obtained if the size of the paper filter extracted contains a fixed blood volume. We describe for the first time a microfluidic-based sampling procedure to enable accurate blood volume collection on commercially available DBS cards. The system allows the collection of a controlled volume of blood (e.g., 5 or 10 \u03bcL) within several seconds. Reproducibility of the sampling volume was examined in vivo on capillary blood by quantifying caffeine and paraxanthine on 5 different extracted DBS spots at two different time points and in vitro with a test compound, Mavoglurant, on 10 different spots at two Hct levels. Entire spots were extracted. In addition, the accuracy and precision (n = 3) data for the Mavoglurant quantitation in blood with Hct levels between 26% and 62% were evaluated. The interspot precision data were below 9.0%, which was equivalent to that of a manually spotted volume with a pipet. No Hct effect was observed in the quantitative results obtained for Hct levels from 26% to 62%. These data indicate that our microfluidic-based sampling procedure is accurate and precise and that the analysis of Mavoglurant is not affected by the Hct values. This provides a simple procedure for DBS sampling with a fixed volume of capillary blood, which could eliminate the recurrent Hct issue linked to DBS sample analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Luc Alexis Leuthold"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac503931g","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T15:22:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0003-2700"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1425495820,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac503931g","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac503931g?hootPostID=648bd41a3be8ff116a8921f7857afeda&"],"pmid":"25607538","pubdate":"2015-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"A new microfluidic-based sampling procedure for overcoming the hematocrit problem associated with dried blood spot analysis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-microfluidicbased-sampling-procedure-overcoming-hematocrit-problem-associated-dried-blood-spot-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4833580,"mean":5.7669729527574,"rank":1037815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3786385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4833580,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170764,"mean":8.6570311952826,"rank":43537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":126729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170764,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5284,"mean":2.8240734431194,"rank":517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5284,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":2.4478713826367,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
