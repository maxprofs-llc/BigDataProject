HIV spreads by vertical transmission and by iatrogenic transmission (transfer of blood or blood-containing products), by infected needles among i.v. drug users and, more rarely, among health care workers, but mainly by sexual contact. In Western countries the virus is mainly spread by passive anal intercourse among homosexuals and seldom by heterosexual intercourse. In African countries, however, the virus is mainly spread by heterosexual intercourse, probably because of other, concurring sexually transmitted diseases. Some preventive measures are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000597d","authors":["M van der Graaf","R J Diepersloot"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T15:06:18+00:00","issns":["0300-8126"],"issue":"5","journal":"Infection","last_mentioned_on":1291404466,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3539811"],"pmid":"3539811","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV\/HTLV-III\/LAV): a review.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transmission-human-immunodeficiency-virus-hivhtlviiilav-review-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":816719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94062,"mean":8.1095279446318,"rank":24486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94062,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266,"mean":2.038558490566,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.1809230769231,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Misconceptions about HIV\/AIDS","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=400358646#altmetric_citation_21","license":"public","citation_ids":[3235310,3235312],"posted_on":"2010-12-03T19:27:46+00:00","summary":"The spread of HIV\/AIDS has affected millions of people worldwide; AIDS is considered a pandemic.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=368736","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rjwilmsi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rjwilmsi"}}]}}
