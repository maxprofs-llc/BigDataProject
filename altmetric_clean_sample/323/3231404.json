We showed by HPV DNA determination in cervico-vaginal rinses a significant increase in multiple (>1) HPV infection in HIV-1 seropositive women compared with HIV-1 seronegative women (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.3-11.9). We also demonstrated a significant increase in multiple HPV infections in HIV-1 seronegative women using nonoxynol-9 compared with HIV-1 seronegative women using placebo (OR 3.5 95% CI 1.0-11.8). We conclude that the use of nonoxynol-9 did not prevent genital HPV infection and could increase the virus' ability to infect or persist.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003708","authors":["Marais D","Carrara H","Kay P","Ramjee G","Allan B","Williamson AL"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.virusres.2006.04.009","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T13:03:13+00:00","issns":["0168-1702"],"issue":"2","journal":"Virus Research","last_mentioned_on":1397766913,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.virusres.2006.04.009","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16860426"],"pmid":"16860426","pubdate":"2006-07-25T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"The impact of the use of COL-1492, a nonoxynol-9 vaginal gel, on the presence of cervical human papillomavirus in female sex workers.","type":"article","volume":"121","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-col1492-nonoxynol9-vaginal-gel-presence-cervical-human-papillomavirus-female-sex-workers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3668839,"mean":4.948113674688,"rank":829047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2315805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3668839,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99105,"mean":8.5392219688408,"rank":27216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":70771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99105,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":477,"mean":1.9470378151261,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":477,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.23125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
