Neurotoxicity occurred in 38 cases and was the predominant clinical feature. Respiratory paralysis developed in 19 patients, and was often rapid in onset--in 3 cases apnea occurred within 30 min of the bite. There were 2 deaths, both in patients who were moribund upon arrival at the hospital. Three patients developed necrosis, and 14 individuals with systemic symptoms had no local swelling. Both cardiotoxicity and reliable nonspecific signs of envenoming were absent. Bites by the Philippine cobra produce a distinctive clinical picture characterized by severe neurotoxicity of rapid onset and minimal local tissue damage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006990","authors":["G Watt","L Padre","L Tuazon","R D Theakston","L Laughlin","Watt, G","Padre, L","Tuazon, L","Theakston, R D","Laughlin, L"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T15:44:08+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0002-9637"],"issue":"3","journal":"The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1502450230,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3177741","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3177741"],"pmid":"3177741","pubdate":"1988-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Bites by the Philippine cobra (Naja naja philippinensis): prominent neurotoxicity with minimal local signs.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bites-philippine-cobra-naja-naja-philippinensis-prominent-neurotoxicity-minimal-local-signs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":2140629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5073865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241644,"mean":8.3044970472971,"rank":69586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":166243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241644,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4479,"mean":5.2041933899062,"rank":920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4479,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":6.9430133333333,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Philippine cobra","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=463574197#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3236770],"posted_on":"2011-12-01T22:44:17+00:00","summary":"The Philippine cobra (Naja philippinensis) also called northern Philippine cobra, is a stocky, highly venomous species of spitting cobra native to the northern regions of the Philippines.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=4112824","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Sebastian80","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Sebastian80"}},{"title":"Naja","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=585167544#altmetric_citation_9","license":"public","citation_ids":[3236770],"posted_on":"2013-12-08T19:39:36+00:00","summary":"Naja is a genus of venomous elapid snakes known as cobras.
