Phil Trans B","Fascinating article on the link b\/w behavior + music Even animals compose: What it means to be a musical species"],"citation":{"abstract":"In the introduction to this theme issue, Honing et al. suggest that the origins of musicality-the capacity that makes it possible for us to perceive, appreciate and produce music-can be pursued productively by searching for components of musicality in other species. Recent studies have highlighted that the behavioural relevance of stimuli to animals and the relation of experimental procedures to their natural behaviour can have a large impact on the type of results that can be obtained for a given species. Through reviewing laboratory findings on animal auditory perception and behaviour, as well as relevant findings on natural behaviour, we provide evidence that both traditional laboratory studies and studies relating to natural behaviour are needed to answer the problem of musicality. Traditional laboratory studies use synthetic stimuli that provide more control than more naturalistic studies, and are in many ways suitable to test the perceptual abilities of animals. However, naturalistic studies are essential to inform us as to what might constitute relevant stimuli and parameters to test with laboratory studies, or why we may or may not expect certain stimulus manipulations to be relevant. These two approaches are both vital in the comparative study of musicality.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032f2","authors":["Marisa Hoeschele","Hugo Merchant","Yukiko Kikuchi","Yuko Hattori","Carel ten Cate"],"doi":"10.1098\/rstb.2014.0094","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T16:29:11+00:00","funders":["niehs","wellcome","bbsrc"],"issns":["1471-2970","0962-8436"],"issue":"1664","journal":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1478799149,"links":["http:\/\/rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/370\/1664\/20140094.abstract?etoc=","http:\/\/rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/370\/1664\/20140094","http:\/\/rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/370\/1664\/20140094.abstract?etoc","http:\/\/m.rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/370\/1664\/20140094","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1098\/rstb.2014.0094"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/royptb\/370\/1664\/20140094.full.pdf","pmid":"25646517","pubdate":"2015-03-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Searching for the origins of musicality across species.","type":"article","volume":"370","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/searching-origins-musicality-across-species"},"altmetric_score":{"score":58.13,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":58.13},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8357686,"mean":7.0472856476328,"rank":160181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8197580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8357686,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241661,"mean":8.3048066953572,"rank":6290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":235371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241661,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3412,"mean":11.999356200528,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":3283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3412,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":23.627630769231,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":11,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
