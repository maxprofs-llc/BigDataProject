Clinical analysis of transient, painless, asymmetrical visual loss occurring in bright light in a 54-year-old man.\nCarotid ultrasound showed bilateral carotid disease. Carotid angiography demonstrated occlusion of the left internal carotid artery and severe stenosis of the right internal carotid artery and both external carotid arteries. Visual symptoms and an abnormal photostress test completely remitted after a right carotid endarterectomy.\nLight-induced amaurosis is an unfamiliar manifestation of ocular ischemic syndrome occurring with severe, often bilateral, carotid artery disease. Its recognition is important because the complaint is associated with severe carotid occlusive disease and recognition is necessary for timely surgical intervention because of the major risk for stroke.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002205","authors":["Kitti Kaiboriboon","Paisith Piriyawat","John B Selhorst"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0002-9394(00)00874-6","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T13:42:29+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0002-9394"],"issue":"5","journal":"American Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1261905217,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0002939400008746","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0002-9394(00)00874-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002939400008746\/pdf","pmid":"11336956","pubdate":"2001-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Light-induced amaurosis fugax","type":"article","volume":"131","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lightinduced-amaurosis-fugax"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626939,"mean":4.9512885298875,"rank":817811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626939,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93638,"mean":8.0545493554899,"rank":24323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93638,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1049,"mean":1.8883740458015,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1049,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":0.83157894736842,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
