However, the correct identification of covalently linked (cross-linked or XL) peptides analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry is still an open challenge. Here we present SIM-XL, a software tool that can analyze data generated through commonly used cross-linkers (e.g., BS3\/DSS, etc.). Our software introduces a new paradigm for search-space reduction, which ultimately accounts for its increase in speed and sensitivity. Moreover, our search engine is the first to capitalize on reporter ions for selecting tandem mass spectra derived from cross-linked peptides. It also makes available a 2D interaction map and a spectrum-annotation tool unmatched by any of its kind. We show SIM-XL to be more sensitive and faster than a competing tool when analyzing a dataset obtained from the human HSP90. The software is freely available for academic use at http:\/\/patternlabforproteomics.org\/sim-xl. A video demonstrating the tool is available at http:\/\/patternlabforproteomics.org\/sim-xl\/video. SIM-XL is the first tool to support XL data in the mzIdentML format; all data are thus available from the ProteomeXchange consortium (identifier PXD001677).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ee4","authors":["Diogo B Lima","Tatiani B de Lima","Tiago S Balbuena","Ana Gisele C Neves-Ferreira","Valmir C Barbosa","F\u00e1bio C Gozzo","Paulo C Carvalho"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jprot.2015.01.013","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T15:15:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-7737","18743919"],"journal":"Journal of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1446637213,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25638023?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25638023","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1874391915000226"],"pmid":"25638023","pubdate":"2015-01-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"SIM-XL: A powerful and user-friendly tool for peptide cross-linking analysis ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simxl-powerful-userfriendly-tool-peptide-crosslinking-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.33,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6532138,"mean":6.0512187797026,"rank":582370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":5949544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6532138,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206634,"mean":8.4969213533174,"rank":26331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":180296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206634,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1483,"mean":1.9078488529015,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1483,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.1816896551724,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
