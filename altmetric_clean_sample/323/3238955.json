The differential diagnosis with basal cell carcinoma is often difficult to make and the optimal treatment has not yet been established.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000d002","authors":["Laffay L","Depaepe L","d'Hombres A","Balme B","Thomas L","De Bari B"],"doi":"10.1700\/1088.11948","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T16:46:14+00:00","issns":["0300-8916"],"issue":"2","journal":"Tumori","last_mentioned_on":1407061853,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1700\/1088.11948","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22678003"],"pmid":"22678003","pubdate":"2012-06-09T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Histological features and treatment approach of trichoblastic carcinomas: from a case report to a review of the literature.","type":"article","volume":"98","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histological-features-treatment-approach-trichoblastic-carcinomas-case-report-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4614200,"mean":5.4146155701656,"rank":1072007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2971830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4614200,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153897,"mean":8.8905692025784,"rank":44989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":106958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153897,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":1.2613099415205,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.84230769230769,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Basal-cell carcinoma","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=619656894#altmetric_citation_26","license":"public","citation_ids":[3238955],"posted_on":"2014-08-03T10:30:53+00:00","summary":"Basal-cell carcinoma or basal cell cancer (BCC), a skin cancer, is one of the most common cancers in the United States.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=696132","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Perencake","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Perencake"}}]}}
