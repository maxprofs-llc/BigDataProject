Structural studies reveal significant differences in their Hsp90 binding characteristics, and macbecin-induced tumor cell growth inhibition is accompanied by characteristic degradation of Hsp90 client proteins. Macbecin significantly reduced tumor growth rates (minimum T\/C: 32%) in a DU145 murine xenograft. Macbecin thus represents an attractive lead for further optimization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Christine J.
