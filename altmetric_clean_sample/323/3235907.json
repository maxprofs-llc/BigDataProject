Recent observations suggest that the spindle midzone is required for this process. In this study, we investigated the possibility that targeted secretion in the vicinity of the spindle midzone is required for the execution of the terminal phase of cytokinesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002660","authors":["Skop, A R","Bergmann, D","Mohler, W A","White, J G"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0960-9822(01)00231-7","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T15:21:49+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0960-9822"],"issue":"10","journal":"Current Biology","last_mentioned_on":1356744422,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0960-9822(01)00231-7","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0960-9822(01)00231-7","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11378383"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0960982201002317\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC3733387","pmid":"11378383","pubdate":"2017-07-04T12:02:10+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Completion of cytokinesis in C. elegans requires a brefeldin A-sensitive membrane accumulation at the cleavage furrow apex.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/completion-cytokinesis-c-elegans-requires-brefeldin-asensitive-membrane-accumulation-cleavage-furrow"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9308753696201,"rank":815958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2282713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92853,"mean":7.3406350820132,"rank":23728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92853,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4854,"mean":15.73032680816,"rank":1914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":2092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4854,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":42.092285714286,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
