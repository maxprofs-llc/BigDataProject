Oncospheral stage-specific 45W proteins are good candidates for the development of anticysticercosis vaccines. In this study, a recombinant 45W-4B protein was highly produced and used for vaccination. Two animal trials resulted in a significant reduction in parasite burden induced by the definite protein against Asiatic T. solium, up to 97.0% and 98.4%, respectively. These provide informative results for the development of effective 45W-4B vaccines against cysticercosis caused by both Chinese and Mexican T. solium isolates and even by other isolates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ef8","authors":["Xuenong Luo","Yadong Zheng","Junling Hou","Shaohua Zhang","Xuepeng Cai"],"doi":"10.1128\/cvi.00367-08","first_seen_on":"2015-02-02T16:27:21+00:00","issns":["1556-679X"],"journal":"Clinical and Vaccine Immunology (formerly CDLI)","last_mentioned_on":1405247098,"links":["http:\/\/cvi.asm.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19091992","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/CVI.00367-08","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19091992","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2643551"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cvi.asm.org\/content\/16\/2\/230.full.pdf","pmid":"19091992","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Protection against Asiatic Taenia solium Induced by a Recombinant 45W-4B Protein","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protection-against-asiatic-taenia-solium-induced-recombinant-45w4b-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4014876,"mean":5.0322541547478,"rank":921451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2537190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4014876,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124780,"mean":9.011306442694,"rank":37641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124780,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":410,"mean":2.9213740831296,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":410,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.103125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
