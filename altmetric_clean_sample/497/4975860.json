We performed a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial to compare EUS-BD vs PTBD for malignant distal biliary obstruction after failed ERCP.\nPatients with unresectable malignant distal biliary obstructions and failed primary ERCP, due to inaccessible papilla, were assigned to groups that underwent EUS-BD with an all in 1 device for direct deployment of a partially covered metal stent (without further fistula tract dilation, n=34) or PTBD (n=32). The procedures were performed at 4 tertiary academic referral centers in South Korea from October 2014 through March 2015; patients were followed through June 2015. The primary endpoint was technical success, calculated using a non-inferiority model. Secondary endpoints were functional success, procedure-related adverse events, rate of unscheduled re-intervention, and quality of life (QOL).\nRates of primary technical success were 94.1% (32\/34) in the EUS-BD group and 96.9% (31\/32) in the PTBD group (1-sided 97.5% confidence interval [CI] lower limit, -12.7%; P=.008 for a non-inferiority margin of 15%). Rate of functional success were 87.5% (28\/32) in the EUS-BD and 87.1% (27\/31) in the PTBD group (P=1.00). The proportions of procedure-related adverse events were 8.8% in the EUS-BD group vs 31.2% in the PTBD group (P=.022); the mean frequency of unscheduled re-intervention was 0.34 in the EUS-BD group vs 0.93 in the PTBD (P=.02) were higher in the PTBD group. The QOL was similar between groups.\nEUS-BD and PTBD had similar levels of efficacy in patients with unresectable malignant distal biliary obstruction and inaccessible papilla, based on rates of technical and functional success and QOL. However, EUS-BD produced fewer procedure-related adverse events and unscheduled re-interventions.
