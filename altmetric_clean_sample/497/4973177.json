Rats were divided into four groups: the control group, injected with physiological saline; the CCl\u2084 group; the CCl\u2084 plus resveratrol group; and the resveratrol group. After treatment, immunostaining was performed to detect Notch1, Notch3, Notch4, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and TUNEL assays were performed to evaluate apoptosis. Sirius red staining was used to detect fibrosis. Samples were also biochemically evaluated for glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation. GSH, GPx, and catalase activities were significantly decreased (p\u27e80.001) in the CCl\u2084 group. Distinct collagen accumulation was detected around the central vein and portal areas, and numbers of Notch1-, Notch3-, and Notch4-positive cells were significantly increased (p\u27e80.001) in fibrotic areas in the CCl\u2084 group. Increased expression of Notch proteins in fibrotic areas may support the role of Notch in mediating signaling associated with liver fibrosis through activation of hepatic stellate and progenitor cells. In contrast, resveratrol prevented liver fibrosis by decreasing lipid peroxidation and may be effective for inhibiting Notch signaling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007639","authors":["Tanriverdi, Gamze","Kaya-Dagistanli, Fatma","Ayla, Sule","Demirci, Sibel","Eser, Mediha","Unal, Z Seda","Cengiz, Mujgan","Oktar, Huseyin"],"doi":"10.14670\/hh-11-720","first_seen_on":"2016-01-09T11:02:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1699-5848"],"journal":"Histology and Histopathology","last_mentioned_on":1492087954,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26742567?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26742567?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26742567","pubdate":"2016-01-09T22:01:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["histology","pathology"],"title":"Resveratrol can prevent CCl\u2084-induced liver injury by inhibiting Notch signaling pathway.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resveratrol-prevent-ccl4induced-liver-injury-inhibiting-notch-signaling-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":4268067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2237690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317437,"mean":9.4046614246649,"rank":166145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":116506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317437,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":341,"mean":1.9974647058824,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":341,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.1823529411765,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
