In contrast to those derived from humans, macrophages derived from most mouse strains restrict L. pneumophila replication. The restriction of L. pneumophila replication has been shown to require bacterial flagellin, a component of the type IV secretion system as well as the cytosolic NOD-like receptor (NLR) Nlrc4\/ Ipaf. These events lead to caspase-1 activation which, in turn, activates caspase-7. Following caspase-7 activation, the phagosome-containing L. pneumophila fuses with the lysosome, resulting in the restriction of L. pneumophila growth. The LegS2 effector is injected by the type IV secretion system and functions as a sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase. It is homologous to the eukaryotic sphingosine lyase (SPL), an enzyme required in the terminal steps of sphingolipid metabolism. Herein, we show that mice Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) and human Monocyte-Derived Macrophages (hMDMs) are more permissive to L. pneumophila legS2 mutants than wild-type (WT) strains. This permissiveness to L. pneumophila legS2 is neither attributed to abolished caspase-1, caspase-7 or caspase-3 activation, nor due to the impairment of phagosome-lysosome fusion. Instead, an infection with the legS2 mutant resulted in the reduction of some inflammatory cytokines and their corresponding mRNA; this effect is mediated by the inhibition of the nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB). Moreover, BMDMs infected with L. pneumophila legS2 mutant showed elongated mitochondria that resembles mitochondrial fusion. Therefore, the absence of LegS2 effector is associated with reduced NF-\u03baB activation and atypical morphology of mitochondria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Abu Khweek, Arwa","Kanneganti, Apurva","C Guttridge D, Denis","Amer, Amal O"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0146410","first_seen_on":"2016-01-08T13:55:15+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nhlbi"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1467301387,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26741365?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0146410"],"pmcid":"PMC4704736","pmid":"26741365","pubdate":"2016-01-08T22:00:22+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Lyase (LegS2) Contributes to the Restriction of Legionella pneumophila in Murine Macrophages","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sphingosine1phosphate-lyase-legs2-contributes-restriction-legionella-pneumophila-murine-macrophages"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":6042623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1073158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316026,"mean":9.2883001787831,"rank":218898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":51413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316026,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111985,"mean":10.341981943849,"rank":81499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":17624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111985,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4961,"mean":11.546955241935,"rank":3752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4961,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
