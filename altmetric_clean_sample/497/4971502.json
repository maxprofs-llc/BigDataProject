Mapping national or international investments relating to norovirus research is limited.\nWe analyzed the focus and type of norovirus research funding awarded to institutions in the United States and United Kingdom during 1997-2013. Data were obtained from key public and philanthropic funders across both countries, and norovirus-related research was identified from study titles and abstracts. Included studies were further categorized by the type of scientific investigation, and awards related to vaccine, diagnostic, and therapeutic research were identified. Norovirus publication trends are also described using data from Scopus.\nIn total, US and United Kingdom funding investment for norovirus research was \u00a397.6 million across 349 awards; 326 awards (amount, \u00a384.9 million) were received by US institutions, and 23 awards (\u00a312.6 million) were received by United Kingdom institutions. Combined, \u00a381.2 million of the funding (83.2%) was for preclinical research, and \u00a316.4 million (16.8%) was for translational science. Investments increased from \u00a31.7 million in 1997 to \u00a311.8 million in 2013. Publication trends showed a consistent temporal increase from 48 in 1997 to 182 in 2013.\nDespite increases over time, trends in US and United Kingdom funding for norovirus research clearly demonstrate insufficient translational research and limited investment in diagnostics, therapeutics, or vaccine research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Michael G.
