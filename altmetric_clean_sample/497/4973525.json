We used Bayesian methods to adjust for exposure misclassification.\nA hospital-based case-control study was used to identify breast cancer risk factors among Iranian women. Three models were jointly considered; an outcome, an exposure and a measurement model. All models were fitted using Bayesian methods, run to achieve convergence.\nBayesian analysis in the model without misclassification showed that the odds ratios for the relationship between breast cancer and a family history in different prior distributions were 2.98 (95% CRI: 2.41, 3.71), 2.57 (95% CRI: 1.95, 3.41) and 2.53 (95% CRI: 1.93, 3.31). In the misclassified model, adjusted odds ratios for misclassification in the different situations were 2.64 (95% CRI: 2.02, 3.47), 2.64 (95% CRI: 2.02, 3.46), 1.60 (95% CRI: 1.07, 2.38), 1.61 (95% CRI: 1.07, 2.40), 1.57 (95% CRI: 1.05, 2.35), 1.58 (95% CRI: 1.06, 2.34) and 1.57 (95% CRI: 1.06, 2.33).\nIt was concluded that self-reported family history may be misclassified in different scenarios. Due to the lack of validation studies in Iran, more attention to this matter in future research is suggested, especially while obtaining results in accordance with sensitivity and specificity values.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b68","authors":["Moradzadeh, Rahmatollah","Mansournia, Mohammad Ali","Baghfalaki, Taban","Ghiasvand, Reza","Noori-Daloii, Mohammad Reza","Holakouie-Naieni, Kourosh"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-09T11:25:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1513-7368"],"issue":"18","journal":"Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1452338734,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26745064?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26745064","pubdate":"2016-01-09T22:00:24+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Misclassification Adjustment of Family History of Breast Cancer in a Case-Control Study: a Bayesian Approach.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/misclassification-adjustment-family-history-breast-cancer-casecontrol-study-bayesian-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6922153,"mean":6.2167633701173,"rank":5933582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6922153,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303257,"mean":9.1057619568943,"rank":247208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303257,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1298,"mean":2.1299444872783,"rank":712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1298,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":1.4046153846154,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/685784475372916736","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4973525],"posted_on":"2016-01-09T11:25:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"685784475372916736"}]}}
