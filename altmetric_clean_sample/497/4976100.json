This study compares the Provox 2 and Provox Vega voice prostheses on the parameter of device life.\nThis was a retrospective observational study of 21 patients with 181 device replacements at an academic tertiary care medical center. Disparity in device life and factors that may influence device life were analyzed.\nThe mean device life for Provox 2, at 115.6 days (SE = 5.8), was longer than for Provox Vega, at 65.1 days (SE = 7.5) (P < .001).\nDevice longevity was greater for Provox 2 over Provox Vega. These results will facilitate the design of prospective studies to assess reasons for variations in device life between patients and device types.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002282","authors":["Thylur, David S","Villegas, Brenda Capobres","Fisher, Laurel M","Sinha, Uttam K","Kokot, Niels"],"doi":"10.1177\/0003489415624701","first_seen_on":"2016-01-10T14:36:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0003-4894"],"journal":"Annals of Otology, Rhinology & Laryngology","last_mentioned_on":1452436563,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26747630?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26747630","pubdate":"2016-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Device Life of Two Generations of Provox Voice Prostheses.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/device-life-two-generations-provox-voice-prostheses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6927529,"mean":6.2207408899661,"rank":3402290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2018775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6927529,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303230,"mean":9.123211909151,"rank":156428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":113774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303230,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":549,"mean":3.5546094890511,"rank":275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":549,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.2125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
