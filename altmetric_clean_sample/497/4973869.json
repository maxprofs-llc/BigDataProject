And there is limited information in the turbot database regarding genes related to the reproductive system. Here, we conducted high-throughput transcriptome profiling of turbot gonad tissues to better understand their reproductive functions and to supply essential gene sequence information for marker-assisted selection programs in the turbot industry. In this study, two gonad libraries representing sex differences in Scophthalmus maximus yielded 453\u2009818 high-quality reads that were assembled into 24\u2009611 contigs and 33\u2009713 singletons by using 454 pyrosequencing, 13\u2009936 contigs and singletons (CS) of which were annotated using BLASTx. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analyses revealed that various biological functions and processes were associated with many of the annotated CS. Expression analyses showed that 510 genes were differentially expressed in males versus females; 80% of these genes were annotated. In addition, 6484 and 6036 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in male and female libraries, respectively. This transcriptome resource will serve as the foundation for cDNA or SNP microarray construction, gene expression characterization, and sex-specific linkage mapping in turbot.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c44","authors":["Hu, Yulong","Huang, Meng","Wang, Weiji","Guan, Jiantao","Kong, Jie"],"doi":"10.1139\/gen-2014-0190","first_seen_on":"2016-01-09T13:00:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1480-3321","0831-2796"],"issue":"1","journal":"Genome","last_mentioned_on":1465991707,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26745327","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26745327?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26745327","pubdate":"2016-01-09T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Characterization of gonadal transcriptomes from the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus).","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-gonadal-transcriptomes-turbot-iscophthalmus-maximusi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7902020,"mean":6.6891515940364,"rank":5992699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1060128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7902020,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315308,"mean":9.3008272826164,"rank":218683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":51025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315308,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":504,"mean":2.7698091451292,"rank":295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":504,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.28125,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
