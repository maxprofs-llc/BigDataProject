Existing reviews of physical activity (PA) interventions designed to increase PA behaviour exclusively in children (ages 5 to 11 years) focus primarily on the efficacy (e.g., internal validity) of the interventions without addressing the applicability of the results in terms of generalizability and translatability (e.g., external validity).\n. This review used the RE-AIM (Reach, Efficacy\/Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework to measure the degree to which randomised and non-randomised PA interventions in children report on internal and external validity factors.\n. A systematic search for controlled interventions conducted within the past 12 years identified 78 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Based on the RE-AIM criteria, most of the studies focused on elements of internal validity (e.g., sample size, intervention location and efficacy\/effectiveness) with minimal reporting of external validity indicators (e.g., representativeness of participants, start-up costs, protocol fidelity and sustainability).\n. Results of this RE-AIM review emphasize the need for future PA interventions in children to report on real-world challenges and limitations, and to highlight considerations for translating evidence-based results into health promotion practice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003383","authors":["McGoey, Tara","Root, Zach","Bruner, Mark W","Law, Barbi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ypmed.2015.11.004","first_seen_on":"2016-01-09T12:12:47+00:00","issns":["1096-0260"],"journal":"Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1452341550,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26582207"],"pmid":"26582207","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Evaluation of Physical Activity Interventions in Children via the Reach, Efficacy\/Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework: A Systematic Review of Randomised and Non-Randomised Trials.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-physical-activity-interventions-children-via-reach-efficacyeffectiveness-adoption-impleme"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6922153,"mean":6.2167633701173,"rank":5162937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":988638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6922153,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303259,"mean":9.1057177320959,"rank":207421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303259,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1797,"mean":11.385981069042,"rank":1544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1797,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":24.625206896552,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
