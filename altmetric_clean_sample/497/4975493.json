Afterwards the GPs commented on the tapes. Fourteen consultations, in which it was obvious that the GP felt uncertain and did not grasp the situation, were especially studied. One important contributing factor was that the GP often did not fully understand the patient's reason for the consultation. A general outcome was that the GP usually did not allow himself to use his feelings of uncertainty as useful information about the situation.","altmetric_jid":"55c35c2e2a83ee85598b4567","authors":["Arborelius, E","Bremberg, S","Timpka, T"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-10T09:44:01+00:00","issns":["0263-2136"],"issue":"1","journal":"Family Practise","last_mentioned_on":1452419025,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2044868"],"pmid":"2044868","pubdate":"1991-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"What is going on when the general practitioner doesn't grasp the situation?","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/going-general-practitioner-doesnt-grasp-situation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7937410,"mean":6.7113967250465,"rank":6870340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7937410,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315628,"mean":9.3243080091371,"rank":264621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315628,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1007,"mean":6.2467335984095,"rank":977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1007,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":10.62,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
