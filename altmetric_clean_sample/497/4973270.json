Among the most commonly taken medications are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Because these drugs have become almost ubiquitous, there is a risk underestimating potential effects, which may be harmful for the patient undergoing anesthesia and surgery. These effects can range from mild to severe and can be exacerbated by drug interactions with many commonly administered medications. This review of NSAID pharmacology a d interactions is intended to serve as an update and refresher for nurse anesthetists to increase their awareness of the potential untoward effects of postoperative bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, asthma, hepatic and renal toxicity and cardiovascular events.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000376e","authors":["Bozimowski, Gregory"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-09T11:07:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0094-6354"],"issue":"6","journal":"AANA Journal","last_mentioned_on":1452337624,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26742337?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26742337","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","anesthesiology"],"title":"A Review of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs.","type":"article","volume":"83","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6922153,"mean":6.2167633701173,"rank":5933557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6922153,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303257,"mean":9.1057471179464,"rank":247192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303257,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178,"mean":1.0969265536723,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.33333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":4,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":10},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":7,"Nursing and Health Professions":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2,"Chemical Engineering":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/685779819934531584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4973270],"posted_on":"2016-01-09T11:07:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
