The present study evaluated albiglutide as monotherapy.\nIn this placebo-controlled study, 309 patients (aged \u226518\u00a0years) with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by diet and exercise and who were not using a glucose-lowering agent (HbA1c 7.0-10.0% [53.00-85.79\u00a0mmol\/mol], body mass index 20-45\u00a0kg\/m(2), and fasting C-peptide \u22650.26\u00a0nmol\/l) were randomised (1:1:1 on a fixed randomisation schedule using an interactive voice response system) to receive once-weekly albiglutide 30\u00a0mg (n\u2009=\u2009102) or 50\u00a0mg (n\u2009=\u2009102) or matching placebo (n\u2009=\u2009105). The study treatments were blinded to both patients and study personnel. All study data were collected at individual patient clinic visits. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 52. The primary analysis was applied to the intent-to-treat population. Additional efficacy and safety endpoints were assessed.\nAt week 52, both albiglutide 30\u00a0mg and 50\u00a0mg were superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c. The least-squares means treatment difference from placebo was -0.84% (95% CI -1.11%, -0.58%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) with albiglutide 30\u00a0mg and -1.04% (-1.31%, -0.77%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) with albiglutide 50\u00a0mg. Injection-site reactions were reported more frequently with albiglutide (30\u00a0mg: 17.8%; 50\u00a0mg: 22.2%) than with placebo (9.9%). Other commonly reported adverse events included nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and hypoglycaemia; the incidences of these were generally similar across treatment groups.\nAlbiglutide is safe and effective as monotherapy and significantly lowered HbA1c levels over 52\u00a0weeks, did not cause weight gain, and had good gastrointestinal tolerability and a low rate of hypoglycaemia compared with placebo.
