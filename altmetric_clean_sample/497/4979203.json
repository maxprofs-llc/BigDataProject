An essential step for doing so is to extract informative features with high class separability. We propose a set of features derived from frequency analysis of the motion data. Then, we evaluate the practicality of our features on one of the richest data sets collected to study this disease. In this data set, the motion data are extracted from both electromagnetic sensors as well as video camera. The proposed features are used for classifying both data sets. Using these features, we manage to achieve promising classification performance. Classification accuracy of 91% for the sensor data and 88% for the video-derived data show not only the advantage of employing these features for predicting cerebral palsy, but also that replacing electromagnetic sensors with a video camera is feasible.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9253cf058f61000dc6b","authors":["Rahmati, Hodjat","Martens, Harald","Aamo, Ole Morten","Stavdahl, Oyvind","Stoen, Ragnhild","Adde, Lars"],"doi":"10.1109\/embc.2015.7319560","first_seen_on":"2016-01-11T14:38:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-170X"],"journal":"Conference proceedings Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","last_mentioned_on":1452523078,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26737460"],"pmid":"26737460","pubdate":"2016-01-11T22:05:03+00:00","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Frequency-based features for early cerebral palsy prediction.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frequencybased-features-early-cerebral-palsy-prediction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6938388,"mean":6.2242844220111,"rank":5177601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":989465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6938388,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303305,"mean":9.1362867420144,"rank":207695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":55734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303305,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1254,"mean":1.3832992817239,"rank":561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1254,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211,"mean":1.3814476190476,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
