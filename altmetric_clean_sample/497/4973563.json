In the present study, we hypothesized that the miR-124 can repress the expression of RhoA upon the neurogenesis of adipose derived MSCs (ADMSCs).\nMiRNA expression dynamics during neurogenic transdifferentiation of ADMSCs were measured. The expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), Tuj-1 (Neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as well as electrophysiological properties, were detected after neurogenic transdifferentiation. The targeting of miR-124 over RhoA was verified by dual luciferase assay, qRT-PCR and western blot. The functions of miR-124 and the RhoA\/ROCK signaling pathway were studied using gain and loss of function experiments in vitro.\nMiR-124 is significantly upregulated during neurogenic transdifferentiation of ADMSCs. Knockdown of endogenous miR-124 hampered neurogenic transdifferentiation and the acquired electrophysiological properties. MiR-124 could directly target RHOA mRNA and repress its expression, through which it increased the proportion of transdifferentiated (transdiff.) cells with positive NSE, Tuj-1 and GFAP. RhoA\/ROCK1, but not ROCK2 is a downstream signaling pathway of miR-124 in the process of transdifferentiation.\nMiR-124 is an important miRNA modulating neurogenic transdifferentiation of ADMSCs at least partly via the miR-124\/RhoA\/ROCK1 signaling pathway. These findings provided some fundamental information for future use of ADMSCs as an agent for regenerative medicine and cell therapy for neurological diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Wang, Ye","Wang, Desheng","Guo, Dawen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0146646","first_seen_on":"2016-01-09T11:30:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1467889534,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26745800?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0146646","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26745800?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4706435","pmid":"26745800","pubdate":"2016-01-09T22:00:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"MiR-124 Promote Neurogenic Transdifferentiation of Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Partly through RhoA\/ROCK1, but Not ROCK2 Signaling Pathway","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir124-promote-neurogenic-transdifferentiation-adipose-derived-mesenchymal-stromal-cells-partly-thro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019263,"mean":6.7829620361534,"rank":832232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7181534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019263,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317029,"mean":9.3488674754279,"rank":43062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":273445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317029,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111805,"mean":10.468731565955,"rank":17764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":93876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111805,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4908,"mean":11.772159364174,"rank":788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":4105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4908,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
