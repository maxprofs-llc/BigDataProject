Eggs per gram, intestinal number of worms and fecundity, and also Gastric Emptying Time, Cecum Arrival Time, Small Intestinal Transit Time and stool weight were determined. Assessments occurred at 0 (control), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 days post infection (dpi) with three infective loads (400, 2,000, and 10,000L). Gastric emptying was faster (p=0.0001) and the intestinal transit was significantly slower (p=0.001) during the infection time course. Also, linear mixed-effects models showed significantly changes in small intestinal transit after three parasite load over time. Cecum arrival was not influenced by infection time course or parasite load. As indirect effect, stool weight decreased accompanied a strong oviposition peak at 9 dpi in 400L and 2,000L. In several motor function instances, neuromuscular dysfunction persists after mucosal inflammation has decreased. Our approach could be very helpful to evaluate gastrointestinal motor abnormalities in vivo after parasite infection. Despite parasitological data progressively decreased after 15 dpi, small intestinal transit worse over time and according to burden.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002168","authors":["Anjos-Ramos, L","La, Gama","Vlt, Mati","La, Cor\u00e1","Rt, Fujiwara","Mf, Americo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.actatropica.2015.12.010","first_seen_on":"2016-01-09T00:31:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-6254"],"journal":"Acta Tropica","last_mentioned_on":1452299478,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26739657?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26739657","pubdate":"2016-01-09T22:02:41+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Evaluation of gastrointestinal transit after infection with different loads of Strongyloides venezuelensis in rats.","type":"article","volume":"156","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-gastrointestinal-transit-after-infection-different-loads-strongyloides-venezuelensis-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6922153,"mean":6.2167633701173,"rank":5162920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":988708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6922153,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303257,"mean":9.105740193104,"rank":207408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303257,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":915,"mean":2.570704595186,"rank":657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":915,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":1.7634615384615,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
