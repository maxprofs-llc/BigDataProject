Endovascular therapy is less invasive and used increasingly because of patient factors that disfavor open surgery despite limited quality data to support its safety and efficacy. This evidence summary reviews literature from 1990 to 2014, comparing contemporary surgical and endovascular revascularization. Systematic review was performed with emphasis on acuity of presentation, study design, revascularization techniques, limb salvage and mortality rates, and complications. There were 2999 articles identified and 563 abstracts reviewed; 68 articles were reviewed fully and 26 critically appraised. Limb salvage, amputation-free survival, overall survival and mortality, and treatment complications were elucidated, including Medicare outcomes data. Risk factors for amputation and mortality were identified. Surgical or endovascular revascularization for ALI is achievable with acceptable limb salvage and amputation rates, which are not markedly different between the two modalities in the short term. Endovascular therapy and surgery are complementary rather than competing strategies for ALI. Further good-quality clinical trial data are needed to define longer term outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f17","authors":["Wang, John C","Kim, Ann H","Kashyap, Vikram S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvs.2015.09.055","first_seen_on":"2016-01-10T23:48:51+00:00","issns":["1097-6809","0741-5214"],"journal":"Journal of Vascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1452478041,"links":["http:\/\/www.jvascsurg.org\/article\/S0741-5214(15)02014-5\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jvascsurg.org\/article\/S0741521415020145\/pdf","pmid":"26603542","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Open surgical or endovascular revascularization for acute limb ischemia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/open-surgical-endovascular-revascularization-acute-limb-ischemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6938388,"mean":6.2242844220111,"rank":2657530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4268334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6938388,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303313,"mean":9.1261728780923,"rank":108928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":193677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303313,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1511,"mean":3.8265311258278,"rank":456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1511,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":4.3115384615385,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
