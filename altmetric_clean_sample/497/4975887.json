Cloning of its gene, development and characterization of animal models with engineered gene mutations or spontaneous mouse mutations have revealed an unexpected complexity of the gene encoding BP230. The latter, now called dystonin (DST), is composed of at least 100 exons and gives rise to three major isoforms, an epithelial, a neuronal and a muscular isoform, named BPAG1e (corresponding to the original BP230), BPAG1a and BPAG1b, respectively. The various BPAG1 isoforms play a key role in fundamental processes such as cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, and cell migration. Genetic defects of BPAG1 isoforms are the culprits of epidermolysis bullosa and complex, devastating neurological diseases. In this review, we summarize recent advances of our knowledge about the various BPAG1 isoforms, their role in various biological processes and in human diseases.
