Using an optimal cut-off value for tumor-to-normal liver uptake ratio (TLR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared. Further, PFS and OS were compared according to treatment modalities (TACE versus CCRT) using the same TLR cut-off value.\nOn multivariate analysis, age and TLR were independent prognostic factors for PFS (P <0.050). For OS, Child-Pugh classification and TLR were independent prognostic factors (P <0.050). When the TLR was >2.0, patients treated with CCRT showed significantly better PFS and OS than those treated with TACE after adjusting for tumor size and number (P =0.014, for all). In contrast, there was no significant difference in PFS and OS between patients treated with TACE or CCRT when the TLR was \u22642.0.\n(18)F-FDG uptake was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in HCC patients treated with TACE or CCRT. Especially, in HCCs with high (18)F-FDG uptake, patients treated with CCRT showed better survival than those treated with TACE. (18)F-FDG PET\/CT may help determine the treatment modality for intermediate-to-advanced stage HCCs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["Lee, Jeong Won","Oh, Jin Kyoung","Chung, Yong An","Na, Sae Jung","Hyun, Seung Hyup","Hong, Il Ki","Eo, Jae Seon","Song, Bong-Il","Kim, Tae-Sung","Kim, Do Young","Kim, Seung Up","Moon, Dae Hyuk","Lee, Jong Doo","Yun, Mijin"],"doi":"10.2967\/jnumed.115.167338","first_seen_on":"2016-01-10T03:25:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-5667"],"journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1452502180,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26742711?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26742711?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"26742711","pubdate":"2016-01-10T22:03:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Prognostic significance of 18F-FDG uptake in hepatocellular carcinoma treated with transarterial chemoembolization or concurrent chemoradiotherapy; A multicenter retrospective cohort study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-significance-18ffdg-uptake-hepatocellular-carcinoma-treated-transarterial-chemoembolizati-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6938388,"mean":6.2242844220111,"rank":2988105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3793473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6938388,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303313,"mean":9.1261746914067,"rank":129460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":163910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303313,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1926,"mean":3.7429215584416,"rank":669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1926,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":4.8296296296296,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":6,"Other":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Psychology":1,"Mathematics":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/statuses\/686025934118363136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4975264],"posted_on":"2016-01-10T03:25:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24774},"tweet_id":"686025934118363136"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/acafarmur\/statuses\/686099590077136897","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4975264],"posted_on":"2016-01-10T08:17:44+00:00","author":{"name":"ACAFARMUR","url":"http:\/\/www.academiadefarmaciaregiondemurcia.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/417020675857981440\/dV0DUx1E_normal.jpeg","description":"Academia de Farmacia Sta.
