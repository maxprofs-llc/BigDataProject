Postprandial metabolic studies were performed at the end of each treatment period. D3-leucine tracer was administered as subjects consumed a high-fat liquid meal. ApoB-48 kinetics were determined using stable isotope tracer kinetics with fractional catabolic rates (FCR) and secretion rates (SR) derived using a non-steady state compartmental model. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) and incremental AUC for plasma triglyceride and apoB-48 were also calculated over the 10-hour period after ingestion of the fat meal.\nIn statin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, apoB-48 concentration was lower with ERN (8.24\u2009\u00b1\u20091.98 vs 5.48\u2009\u00b1\u20091.14\u2009mg\/L, p\u2009=\u20090.03) compared with statin alone. Postprandial triglyceride and apoB-48 AUC were also significantly lower on ERN treatment (-15% and -26%, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.05) without any change to triglyceride and apoB-48 incremental AUC. ApoB-48 SR in the basal state (3.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.34 vs 2.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31\u2009mg\/kg\/day; p\u2009=\u20090.04) and number of apoB-48 containing particles secreted in response to the fat load (1.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19 vs 0.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\u2009mg\/kg; p\u2009=\u20090.02) were lower on ERN. ApoB-48 FCR was not altered with ERN (8.78\u2009\u00b1\u20091.04 vs 9.17\u2009\u00b1\u20091.26 pools\/day; p\u2009=\u20090.79).\nERN reduces apoB-48 concentration by lowering fasting and postprandial apoB-48 SR. This effect may be beneficial for lowering atherogenic postprandial lipoproteins and may provide cardiovascular disease risk benefit in patients with type 2 diabetes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026fc","authors":["Pang, J.","Chan, D.
