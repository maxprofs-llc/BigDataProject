To date, the potential microRNAs regulating the growth and progression of osteosarcoma are not fully identified yet. Previous reports have shown differentially expressed miR-125b in osteosarcoma. However, the role of miR-125b in human osteosarcoma has not been totally illuminated. In this study, we have shown that miR-125b was downregulated in human osteosarcoma tissues compared to the adjacent tissues and effects as a tumor suppressor in vitro. We found that stable overexpression of miR-125b in osteosarcoma cell lines U2OS and MG-63 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our data also verified that Bcl-2 is the target of miR-125b. Meanwhile, we showed that Bcl-2 was inversely correlated with miR-125b in osteosarcoma tissues. More importantly, we proved that miR-125b increased the chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma cell lines to cisplatin by targeting Bcl-2. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that miR-125b is a tumor suppressor and support its potential application for the treatment of osteosarcoma in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008af4","authors":["Wang, Fei","Yu, Dapeng","Liu, Zhen","Wang, Ruijie","Xu, Yan","Cui, Haiyin","Zhao, Tingbao"],"doi":"10.1177\/1533034615618849","first_seen_on":"2016-01-09T17:13:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-0338"],"journal":"Technology in Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1452359585,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26744308?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26744308","pubdate":"2016-01-09T22:00:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MiR-125b Functions as a Tumor Suppressor and Enhances Chemosensitivity to Cisplatin in Osteosarcoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir125b-functions-tumor-suppressor-enhances-chemosensitivity-cisplatin-osteosarcoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6922153,"mean":6.2167633701173,"rank":5162932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":988610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6922153,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303259,"mean":9.1057615891417,"rank":207427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303259,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":2.1014959349593,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.64285714285714,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
