Atomically-resolved photon maps revealed a significant reduction in luminescence intensity at surface electronic states localized near Ga atoms. Theoretical analysis based on first principles calculations and a rate equation approach was performed to describe the perspective of electron energy dissipation at the surface. Our study reveals that non-radiative recombination through the surface states (SS) is a dominant process for the electron energy dissipation at the surface, which is suggestive of the fast scattering of injected electrons into the SS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["Hiroshi Imada","Kuniyuki Miwa","Jaehoon Jung","Tomoko K Shimizu","Naoki Yamamoto","Yousoo Kim"],"doi":"10.1088\/0957-4484\/26\/36\/365402","first_seen_on":"2016-01-09T00:23:22+00:00","issns":["1361-6528","0957-4484"],"issue":"36","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1452263880,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/0957-4484\/26\/36\/365402"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/0957-4484\/26\/36\/365402\/pdf","pmid":"26294222","pubdate":"2015-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"365402","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Atomic-scale luminescence measurement and theoretical analysis unveiling electron energy dissipation at a p-type GaAs(110) surface","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atomicscale-luminescence-measurement-theoretical-analysis-unveiling-electron-energy-dissipation-ptyp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.848,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.848},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6920439,"mean":6.2148136513881,"rank":994386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5925675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6920439,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303203,"mean":9.1033975501479,"rank":56818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":246355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303203,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1423,"mean":6.0538424753868,"rank":281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1423,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":8.2348307692308,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
