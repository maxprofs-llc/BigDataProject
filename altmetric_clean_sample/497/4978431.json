The purpose of the study was to compare the results of external fixation and flexible intramedullary nailing in pediatric femur fractures.\nTwo groups of patients were treated by external fixator (EF) and flexible intramedullary nailing (FIN) over two different but successive time periods and results compared. The first group (EF) consisted of 45 patients, and the second group had 50 patients.\nThe age in EF group ranged from 6 to 14\u00a0years (average 9.93\u00a0years), and the age in FIN group ranged from 6 to 11\u00a0years (average 7.66\u00a0years). In the EF group, fixator was removed at an average of 12.23\u00a0weeks. In the FIN group, radiographic union was evident at an average time of 10.06\u00a0weeks. Pin-site infection was common in EF group. One patient had a re-fracture in EF group, and one patient had to be re-operated in FIN group after he developed anterior angulation of more than 30\u00b0.\nWe believe that it is the discretion of the surgeon to operate on the femur fracture using either of the treatment modalities. Further randomized studies need to be conducted between these two treatment modalities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002847","authors":["Mubashir Maqbool Wani","Mubashir Rashid","Riyaz Ahmad Dar","Arshad Bashir","Asif Sultan","Iqbal Wani","Shakir Rashid","Mark O\u2019Sullivan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00590-015-1737-8","first_seen_on":"2016-01-11T10:37:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-1068","1633-8065"],"issue":"2","journal":"European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery & Traumatology","last_mentioned_on":1452508611,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00590-015-1737-8"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00590-015-1737-8.pdf","pmid":"26754113","pubdate":"2016-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Paris","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Use of external fixator versus flexible intramedullary nailing in closed pediatric femur fractures: comparing results using data from two cohort studies","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/external-fixator-versus-flexible-intramedullary-nailing-closed-pediatric-femur-fractures-comparing-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6938388,"mean":6.2242844220111,"rank":5949083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6938388,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303305,"mean":9.1362608603907,"rank":247566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303305,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":457,"mean":1.0310833333333,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":457,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.38333333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
