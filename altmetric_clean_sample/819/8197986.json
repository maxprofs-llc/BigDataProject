The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of DLB in individuals aged 60 years and older and to analyze the associated risk factors and clinical features of DLB.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional, two-phase, door-to-door, population-based study that included 5542 participants aged at least 60 years who resided in Ji County. In phase I of the study, we used the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and the Activities of Daily Living scale to screen for dementia. Any person who was suspected of having dementia underwent a clinical examination, blood tests, and a neuroimaging examination to confirm the diagnosis of dementia. In phase II of the study, we further screened eligible participants for DLB using consensus guidelines for the clinical and pathologic diagnosis of DLB.\nThe overall prevalence of DLB in the total population of 5542 study participants was 1.05%; the prevalence of DLB was 10.10% in the population with dementia. Compared to individuals without cognitive impairment, patients with DLB were less engaged in social activities. Having fewer than 5 years of formal education might be a risk factor for DLB. The three core symptoms of DLB - fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and Parkinsonism - were observed in 60.34%, 68.97%, and 63.79% of patients with DLB, respectively.\nOur study provides the first information of the prevalence of DLB in a rural area of China.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003296","authors":["Wei Yue","Xiao-Dan Wang","Zhihong Shi","Yajing Wang","Shuai Liu","Shuling Liu","Ying Zhang","Yajing Zhang","Hui Lu","Wenhua Su","Yong Ji","Yue, Wei","Wang, Xiao-Dan","Shi, Zhihong","Wang, Yajing","Liu, Shuai","Liu, Shuling","Zhang, Ying","Zhang, Yajing","Lu, Hui","Su, Wenhua","Ji, Yong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.parkreldis.2016.05.022","first_seen_on":"2016-05-25T06:41:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13538020","1873-5126"],"journal":"Parkinsonism & Related Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1465578880,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1353802016301833&_version=1&md5=1a43c1128d0f65951331ce9d5e16a642","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27264344"],"pmid":"27264344","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The prevalence of dementia with Lewy bodies in a rural area of China","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-dementia-lewy-bodies-rural-area-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":841603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7026986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269549,"mean":11.440851506967,"rank":42907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":225786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269549,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1068,"mean":3.2736007497657,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1068,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":2.9896226415094,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
