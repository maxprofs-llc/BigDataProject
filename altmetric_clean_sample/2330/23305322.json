However, measurement of folates is technically complicated and time-consuming. In this study, we developed a dipstick immunoassay using a folate-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), allowing rapid and low-cost detection of folates. The indicator range of the dipstick for 5-formylterahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-THF) and their polyglutamyl forms was 100-200\u00a0ng\u00a0mL(-1); moreover, no cross-reactivity was observed with tetrahydrofolate (THF) or 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH=THF) at 500\u00a0ng\u00a0mL(-1), or with the folate precursors pterin-6-COOH, p-aminobenzoate (pABA), and L-glutamate, or with the folate analogues methotrexate and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-CHO-THF) at up to 1000\u00a0ng\u00a0mL(-1). The dipstick immunoassay was tested in maize seeds; the results classified the seeds into those with low, moderate, and high levels of folates, and were in agreement with those of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Thus, we conclude that the dipstick assay will provide a versatile tool to facilitate large-scale screening of maize rich in folates. Graphical Abstract The dipstick based immunoassay for analyzing folate level in maize.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224a","authors":["Qiuju Liang","Chen Yi","Ling Jiang","Guiyu Tan","Chunyi Zhang","Baomin Wang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00216-017-0504-6","first_seen_on":"2017-07-31T02:22:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1618-2642","1618-2650"],"journal":"Analytical & Bioanalytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1505747531,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00216-017-0504-6","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/epdf\/10.1007\/s00216-017-0504-6?shared_access_token=eL0q1BaXdVQnxn8Nq4E_n_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY5YG3InLGzlNjErcRZ9hfGFAmT-gDRpw4ONq6EbeIViJaWZIzY_2KOhJ6_EfHVEg_Ph67Ozm0uPGz0U0Of3Qd9WDjwzABaJw8xVwC68ehfyzY0u7PIhvM_g8tqabpVwPL4%3D"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00216-017-0504-6.pdf","pmid":"28707064","pubdate":"2017-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Characterization and Evaluation of Materials","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Laboratory Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Monitoring\/Environmental Analysis","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Development of a lateral flow dipstick immunoassay for evaluation of folate levels in maize","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430718,"mean":7.0909734033215,"rank":6396674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1146179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430718,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222199,"mean":12.772028173071,"rank":158529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":39543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222199,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2733,"mean":2.0123982430454,"rank":1373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2733,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":1.06184,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kermitmurray\/statuses\/891846390204071936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23305322],"posted_on":"2017-07-31T02:22:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Kermit Murray","url":"http:\/\/mass-spec.lsu.edu\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/455532058178117632\/I_TcNlsZ_normal.jpeg","description":"Professor of Chemistry at Louisiana State University","id_on_source":"kermitmurray","tweeter_id":"36363027","geo":{"lt":30.45075,"ln":-91.15455,"country":"US"},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"891846390204071936"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnalBioanalChem\/statuses\/909797206512820225","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23305322],"posted_on":"2017-09-18T15:12:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Anal Bioanal Chem","url":"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/abc","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/771693930471624704\/pI4l2RUO_normal.jpg","description":"Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry\n- Your society journal for rapid publication and global visibility of analytical research!","id_on_source":"AnalBioanalChem","tweeter_id":"2281899308","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":595},"tweet_id":"909797206512820225"}]}}
