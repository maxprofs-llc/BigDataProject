To investigate effects of uncertainty of some major factors including temperature, tube length, axial distance between tubes, diameter of tubes and the inward radial deviation (IRD) of atoms in stators on the frequency's stability, theoretical analysis integrating with numerical experiments are carried out. From the results obtained via molecular dynamics simulation, some key points are illustrated for future fabrication of the thermal driven rotary nanomotor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Kun Cai","Jingzhou Yu","Jiao Shi","Qing-Hua Qin"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep46159","first_seen_on":"2017-04-11T07:12:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1491927532,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep46159","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep46159"],"pmid":"28393898","pubdate":"2017-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mechanical engineering","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Carbon nanotubes and fullerenes","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Robust rotation of rotor in a thermally driven nanomotor","type":"article","volume":"7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":6120988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1080610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236574,"mean":12.885399627176,"rank":167937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236574,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32638,"mean":14.976435885651,"rank":23920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":4976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32638,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3342,"mean":18.749183478001,"rank":2372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3342,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UpdateonScience\/statuses\/851823093517492224","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18719377],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T15:43:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Science news","url":"http:\/\/amzn.to\/1pv3dJo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/694990882106273792\/TLd3guV6_normal.jpg","description":"Interesting advances in science each day","id_on_source":"UpdateonScience","tweeter_id":"4855840213","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1753},"tweet_id":"851823093517492224"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AndrewRomanyk\/statuses\/851831927816548352","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18719377],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T16:18:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrew Romanyk","url":"http:\/\/MenuFriend.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/602975597476864002\/kgHsSMsL_normal.jpg","description":"#Husband, #father, #entrepreneur, #aquarist and Co-founder of @MenuFriend.
