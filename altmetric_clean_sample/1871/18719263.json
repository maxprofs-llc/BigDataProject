The digested seaweed then fermented in a pH-controlled batch culture system inoculated with human faeces to mimic the distal colon. Bacterial enumeration were monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridisation, and the fermentation end products, the short chain fatty acids (SCFA), were analysed using HPLC. Both RSS and RSL showed significant increase of Bifidobacterium sp.; from log10 7.96 at 0\u2009h to log10 8.72 at 24\u2009h, and from log10 7.96 at 0\u2009h to log10 8.60 at 24\u2009h, respectively, and shows no significant difference when compared to the Bifidobacterium sp. count at 24\u2009h of inulin fermentation. Both seaweeds also showed significant increase in total SCFA production, particularly acetate and propionate. Overall, this data suggested that K. alvarezii might have the potential as a prebiotic ingredient.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e3f","authors":["Dayang Marshitah Bajury","Muhamad Hanif Rawi","Iqbal Hakim Sazali","Aminah Abdullah","Shahrul Razid Sarbini","Bajury, Dayang Marshitah","Rawi, Muhamad Hanif","Sazali, Iqbal Hakim","Abdullah, Aminah","Sarbini, Shahrul Razid"],"doi":"10.1080\/09637486.2017.1309522","first_seen_on":"2017-04-11T07:05:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0963-7486","1465-3478"],"journal":"International Journal of Food Sciences & Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1492182574,"links":["https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09637486.2017.1309522","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28393631?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28393631","pubdate":"2017-04-11T10:15:49+00:00","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Prebiotic evaluation of red seaweed (Kappaphycus alvarezii) using in vitro colon model","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prebiotic-evaluation-red-seaweed-kappaphycus-alvarezii-using-vitro-colon-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":3473764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4483954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237413,"mean":12.910585749667,"rank":98718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":134861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237413,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":648,"mean":8.5810973724884,"rank":308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":648,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":19.038,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Microbiome_Art\/statuses\/851692549312057344","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18719263],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T07:05:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Articles","url":"https:\/\/maximeborry.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/778305348469919744\/Kq4NuIyd_normal.jpg","description":"A bot retrieving and twitting all the latest Microbiome articles from PubMed.\nMade by @notmaxib","id_on_source":"Microbiome_Art","tweeter_id":"778208387754582018","geo":{"lt":48.84598,"ln":2.20289,"country":"FR"},"followers":401},"tweet_id":"851692549312057344"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/camglyco\/statuses\/851740402524844032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18719263],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T10:15:11+00:00","author":{"name":"CamGlycoscience","url":"http:\/\/camglyco.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/819687021732040706\/xl7Kg5aF_normal.jpg","description":"Tweeting the latest science about #sugars, #carbohydrates, #CAZymes, etc.","id_on_source":"camglyco","tweeter_id":"819673058885664768","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":263},"tweet_id":"851740402524844032"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Symbiosispapers\/statuses\/851744163972300800","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18719263],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T10:30:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Symbiosis papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471619200876687360\/8YeaykyW_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed of new symbiosis- and microbiome-related papers in PubMed.
