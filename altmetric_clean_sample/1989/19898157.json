Small molecule inhibitors of SIRT2 are thought as potential interfering agents for relevant diseases. Discovery of SIRT2 inhibitor has attracted much attention recently. In this investigation, we first adopted a consensus docking\/scoring strategy to screen for novel SIRT2 inhibitors. Structural optimization and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis were then carried out on highly potent compounds with new scaffolds, which led to the discovery of 2-((5-benzyl-5H-[1,2,4]triazino[5,6-b]indol-3-yl)thio)-N-(naphthalen-1-yl)acetamide (SR86). This compound showed good activity against SIRT2 with an IC50 value of 1.3\u03bcM. SR86 did not exhibit activity against SIRT1 and SIRT3, implying a good selectivity for SIRT2. In in vitro cellular assays, SR86 displayed very good anti-viability activity against breast cancer cell line MCF-7. In western blot assays, SR86 showed considerable activity in blocking the deacetylation of \u03b1-tubulin, which is a typical substrate of SIRT2. Collectively, because of the new scaffold structure and good selectivity of SR86, it could serve as a promising lead compound, hence deserving further studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5723cf058f610004c74","authors":["Shenzhen Huang","Chunli Song","Xiang Wang","Guo Zhang","Yanlin Wang","Xiaojuan Jiang","Qizheng Sun","Luyi Huang","Rong Xiang","Yiguo Hu","Linli Li","Shengyong Yang"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jcim.6b00714","first_seen_on":"2017-05-06T09:00:26+00:00","issns":["1549-9596","1549-960X"],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Information & Modeling","last_mentioned_on":1494218305,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jcim.6b00714"],"pmid":"28301150","pubdate":"2017-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Computation Theory And Mathematics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Social Sciences","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["chemistry","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Discovery of New SIRT2 Inhibitors by Utilizing a Consensus Docking\/Scoring Strategy and Structure\u2013Activity Relationship Analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/discovery-new-sirt2-inhibitors-utilizing-consensus-dockingscoring-strategy-structureactivity-relatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":2.1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":3486954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4650074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237276,"mean":12.526203434833,"rank":95044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":140159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237276,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1400,"mean":3.9537055039314,"rank":668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1400,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.0003225806452,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
