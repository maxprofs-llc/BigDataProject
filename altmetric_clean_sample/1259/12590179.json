By nature, nZVI is a highly reactive substance; thus, the possibility of nZVI being toxic is commonly suspected. Accordingly, the cytotoxicity of nZVI and the toxicity of nZVI-related products have been detected by laboratory tests and documented in the literature. However, there are numerous other published studies on its useful nature, which are usually skipped in reviews that deal only with the phenomenon of toxicity. Therefore, the objective of this article is to review both recent publications reporting the toxic effects of nZVI on microbiota and studies documenting the positive effects of nZVI on various environmental remediation processes. Although cytotoxicity is an issue of general importance and relevance, nZVI can reduce the overall toxicity of a contaminated site, which ultimately results in the creation of better living conditions for the autochthonous microflora. Moreover, nZVI changes the properties of the site in a manner such that it can also be used as a tool in a tailor-made approach to support a specific microbial community for the decontamination of a particular polluted site.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022dc","authors":["Jaroslav Semer\u00e1d","Tom\u00e1\u0161 Cajthaml"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00253-016-7901-1","first_seen_on":"2016-10-13T07:02:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0614"],"journal":"Applied Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1476342127,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00253-016-7901-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00253-016-7901-1.pdf","pmid":"27730336","pubdate":"2016-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Ecotoxicity and environmental safety related to nano-scale zerovalent iron remediation applications","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ecotoxicity-environmental-safety-related-nanoscale-zerovalent-iron-remediation-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7534762,"mean":6.5107844469081,"rank":6527172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7534762,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238872,"mean":12.452895738704,"rank":196441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238872,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1999,"mean":2.0228158158158,"rank":1484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.7244642857143,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Microbiome_Art\/statuses\/786462001375641600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12590179],"posted_on":"2016-10-13T07:02:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Articles","url":"https:\/\/maximeborry.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/778305348469919744\/Kq4NuIyd_normal.jpg","description":"A bot retrieving and twitting all the latest Microbiome articles from PubMed.\nMade by @notmaxib","id_on_source":"Microbiome_Art","tweeter_id":"778208387754582018","geo":{"lt":48.84598,"ln":2.20289,"country":"FR"},"followers":402},"tweet_id":"786462001375641600"}]}}
