The routine detection of genetic factors involved in EC has not been extensively performed in Chinese clinical practice, however. In this review we summarise EC-related genetic factors, including Lynch syndrome-associated mutations and non-Lynch syndrome-associated genetic predispositions found in Chinese women, and their potential clinical applications. In addition, we propose a clinical testing strategy for patients with EC and their family members. The objective of this review is to advance basic research regarding the genetic factors involved in EC and to improve its clinical implementation in China.\nReview summarises Chinese research progression of EC-related genetic factors and proposes innovative screening strategy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000244e","authors":["Zhou, JY","Zhang, L","Wei, LH","Wang, JL"],"doi":"10.1111\/1471-0528.14007","endpage":"96","first_seen_on":"2016-10-13T16:04:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-0528"],"issue":"S3","journal":"British Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","last_mentioned_on":1476594503,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1471-0528.14007\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1471-0528.14007\/pdf","pmid":"27627606","pubdate":"2016-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"90","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Endometrial carcinoma-related genetic factors: application to research and clinical practice in China","type":"article","volume":"123","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endometrial-carcinomarelated-genetic-factors-application-research-clinical-practice-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":3682769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3677404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239335,"mean":12.44347704881,"rank":120792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":109721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239335,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3027,"mean":7.5879894249835,"rank":2427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3027,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":8.7917623762376,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
