Positron emission tomography\/computed tomography (PET\/CT) was used to evaluate inflammation and therapeutic effects.\nWe randomly divided 20 male New Zealand white rabbits into a\u00a0pioglitazone-treated group (n\u00a0= 10) and a\u00a0control group (n\u00a0= 10). Atherosclerosis was induced via a\u00a0high-cholesterol diet and endothelial denudation. The animals were maintained on a\u00a0hyperlipidemic diet for 16\u00a0weeks after surgery, and the treatment group received pioglitazone daily. Serum samples were obtained at 8 and 18 weeks postoperatively to assess high-sensitivity C\u2011reactive protein (hs-CRP) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) concentrations. Sixteen rabbits underwent a\u00a0mid-stage PET\/CT scan at week\u00a08, and 11 rabbits underwent an end-stage PET\/CT scan at week\u00a018. PET\/CT parameters, including the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), were measured and documented.\nThere were significantly lower hs-CRP and MMP-9 levels in the pioglitazone group at week\u00a018 (p\u00a0< 0.01). At the end of the 8th\u00a0week, no significant between-group differences in SUVmean and SUVmax were observed. From week\u00a08 to week\u00a018, the SUVmean and SUVmax decreased in the pioglitazone group but the SUVmean increased in the control group, with significant between-group differences at the end of the 18th week (p\u00a0< 0.01). Histopathological examination of aortas in the control and pioglitazone groups revealed significantly smaller plaque area, macrophage density, and tissue calcification area in the latter group.\nPioglitazone affects early vascular microcalcification, and pioglitazone-induced changes can be assessed using (18)F-FDG-PET\/CT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007623","authors":["J.
