The nanoparticles exhibited functions of both fast magnetic response and local surface plasmon resonance. The Fe(3)O(4)@Au nanoparticles were used as probes for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) using p-thiocresol (p-TC) as reporter molecule. With the ability of analyte capture and concentration magnetically, the Fe(3)O(4)@Au nanoparticles showed significant SERS properties with excellent reproducibility. Under non-optimized conditions, detection limit as low as 4.55 pM of analyte can be reached using Fe(3)O(4)@Au nanoparticle assemblies, which excel remarkably the cases with traditional Au nanoprobes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002249","authors":["Qu H","Lai Y","Niu D","Sun S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aca.2012.12.016","first_seen_on":"2013-03-19T19:41:59+00:00","issns":["0003-2670","00032670"],"journal":"Analytica Chimica Acta","last_mentioned_on":1363795702,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003267012018004"],"pmid":"23340284","pubdate":"2013-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering from magneto-metal nanoparticle assemblies ","type":"article","volume":"763","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surfaceenhanced-raman-scattering-magnetometal-nanoparticle-assemblies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2309923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1581545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89792,"mean":6.5694448664121,"rank":44288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":32767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89792,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1063,"mean":1.459670433145,"rank":314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1063,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":2.0731481481481,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
