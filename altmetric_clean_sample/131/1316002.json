RNase 7 is a major AMP involved in cutaneous defense with a high expression in keratinocytes and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. The cytokine IL-17A has been recently identified as a potent inducer of several AMP in keratinocytes. Since the role of IL-17A to induce RNase 7 expression is unknown we analyzed IL-17A alone and in combination with other cytokines to induce RNase 7 expression in keratinocytes. Whereas IL-17A alone only weakly induced RNase 7 expression, the synergistic combination of IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3 (IL-17A\/IFN-\u03b3) was identified as a potent inducer of RNase 7 expression. This combination was more effective in inducing RNase 7 than the combination of IL-17A\/TNF-\u03b1, a combination previously identified as a strong inducer of psoriasis-related immune response genes including several AMP. IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A both have been reported to activate the transcription factor STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Therefore we investigated the influence of STAT3 on the IL-17A\/IFN-\u03b3 -mediated RNase 7 induction. The use of a STAT3 inhibitor as well as siRNA-mediated downregulation of STAT3 resulted in a diminished IL-17A\/IFN-\u03b3 -mediated RNase 7 induction in keratinocytes indicating that STAT3 is involved in this process. Similarly as seen with RNase 7, treatment of keratinocytes with IL-17A\/IFN-\u03b3 revealed also a synergistic induction of gene expression of the AMP human beta-defensin (hBD)-2 and -3 as well as the S100 protein psoriasin (S100A7) indicating that the combination of IL-17A\/IFN-\u03b3 is a potent inducer of various AMP classes in general. This was also reflected by an increase of the Staphylococcus aureus-killing activity of IL-17A\/IFN-\u03b3 -treated keratinocytes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Maren Simanski","Franziska Rademacher","Lena Schr\u00f6der","Hanna Maria Schumacher","Regine Gl\u00e4ser","J\u00fcrgen Harder"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0059531","first_seen_on":"2013-03-22T14:07:54+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1363960961,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0059531?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FPLoSONE+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+New+Articles%29"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0059531.pdf","pmid":"23555696","pubdate":"2013-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e59531","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3 Synergistically Induce RNase 7 Expression via STAT3 in Primary Keratinocytes","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/il17a-ifn-synergistically-induce-rnase-7-expression-via-stat3-primary-keratinocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622323,"mean":4.9312868762118,"rank":2904853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":72375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622323,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85553,"mean":6.3413130727511,"rank":65856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85553,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64050,"mean":8.3145677528143,"rank":50371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64050,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4468,"mean":7.481768524737,"rank":3264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4468,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
