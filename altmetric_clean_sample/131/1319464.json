The authors propose that Le Fort II distraction and simultaneous zygomatic repositioning as a combined procedure can move the central midface and lateral orbits in independent vectors in order to improve the facial deformity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this segmental movement results in more normal facial proportions than Le Fort III distraction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f61000854c","doi":"10.1097\/prs.0b013e318290fa8a","first_seen_on":"2013-03-25T12:04:51+00:00","issns":["0032-1052"],"issue":"","journal":"Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1375385340,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/plasreconsurg\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Normalizing_Facial_Ratios_in_Apert_Syndrome.99610.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/plasreconsurg\/9000\/00000\/Normalizing_Facial_Ratios_in_Apert_Syndrome.99610.pdf","pmid":"23508053","pubdate":"2013-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Normalizing Facial Ratios in Apert Syndrome Patients with Lefort II Midface Distraction and Simultaneous Zygomatic Repositioning","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/normalizing-facial-ratios-apert-syndrome-patients-le-fort-ii-midface-distraction-simultaneous-zygoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":227726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":3400814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85511,"mean":6.3495636299849,"rank":7448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":77989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85511,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2983,"mean":3.1674936284373,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":2893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2983,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":3.3624117647059,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
