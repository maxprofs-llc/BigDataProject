Interest in the use of PCC in diabetology has heightened recently. There is a special need of the usage of PCC in Muslim communities. Six out of the ten countries with the highest prevalence of diabetes are Muslim majority countries. There are several religious and sociocultural issues specific to South Asian Muslim societies that merit the need of individualization of care for people with diabetes. Several such issues are presented in this article, along with recommendations for tackling them.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Asfandyar K Niazi","Sanjay Kalra"],"doi":"10.1186\/2251-6581-11-30","first_seen_on":"2013-03-23T03:00:13+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1364007508,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3598159\/"],"pmid":"23497693","pubdate":"2013-03-23T20:12:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Diabetes","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Metabolic Diseases","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"30","title":"Patient centred care in diabetology: an Islamic perspective from South Asia","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patient-centred-care-diabetology-islamic-perspective-south-asia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":2526798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1585763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91526,"mean":6.789774903032,"rank":45123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":34553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91526,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":2552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.9114893617021,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/beenasarwar\/statuses\/315296459362816000","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1316959],"posted_on":"2013-03-23T02:58:28+00:00","author":{"name":"beena sarwar","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/beenasarwar","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/849721109620686851\/XRs0zpTR_normal.jpg","description":"Writer, editor, filmmaker, @Nieman, journalist @Princeton @BrownUniversity; democracy, humanrights, media, gender, peace, culture; India Pakistan @amankiasha_1","id_on_source":"beenasarwar","tweeter_id":"22518134","geo":{"lt":42.3751,"ln":-71.10561,"country":"US"},"followers":169608},"tweet_id":"315296459362816000"}]}}
