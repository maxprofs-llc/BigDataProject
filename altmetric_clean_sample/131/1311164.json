One of the most important but often neglected complications is osteoporosis and increased risk of fracture during and after cancer treatment. Acquisition of optimal peak bone mass and strength during childhood and adolescence is critical to preventing osteoporosis later in life. However, most childhood cancer patients have multiple risk factors for bone mineral loss. Cancer itself, malnutrition, decreased physical activity during treatment, chemotherapeutic agents such as steroids, and radiotherapy cause bone mineral deficit. Furthermore, complications such as growth hormone deficiency and musculoskeletal deformity have negative effects on bone metabolism. Low bone mineral density is associated with fractures, skeletal deformity, pain, and substantial financial burden not only for childhood cancer survivors but also for public health care systems. Thus, it is important to monitor bone health in these patients and minimize their risk of developing osteoporosis and fragility fractures later in life.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc60","authors":["Kang, Min Jae","Lim, Jung Sub"],"doi":"10.3345\/kjp.2013.56.2.60","first_seen_on":"2013-03-20T03:28:12+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1738-1061"],"issue":"2","journal":"Korean Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1363750008,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23482662?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3589592","pmid":"23482662","pubdate":"2013-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Bone mineral density deficits in childhood cancer survivors: Pathophysiology, prevalence, screening, and management.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bone-mineral-density-deficits-childhood-cancer-survivors-pathophysiology-prevalence-screening-manage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3078428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":958271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89671,"mean":6.5754103713617,"rank":60290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89671,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":1.0109649122807,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.66666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
