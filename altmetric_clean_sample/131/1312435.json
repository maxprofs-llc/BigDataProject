Mammalian SLC13 members mediate the electrogenic Na(+)-coupled anion cotransport at the plasma membrane of epithelial cells (mainly kidney, small intestine, placenta and liver) or cells of the central nervous system. While the two SLC13 cotransporters NaS1 (SLC13A1) and NaS2 (SLC13A4) transport anions such sulfate, selenate and thiosulfate, the three other SLC13 members, NaDC1 (SLC13A2), NaCT (SLC13A5) and NaDC3 (SLC13A3), transport di- and tri-carboxylate Krebs cycle intermediates such as succinate, citrate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate. All these transporters play a variety of physiological and pathophysiological roles in the different organs. Thus, the purpose of this review is to summarize the roles of SLC13 members in human physiology and pathophysiology and what the therapeutic perspectives are. We have also described the most recent advances on the structure, expression, function and regulation of SLC13 transporters.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003110","doi":"10.1016\/j.mam.2012.12.001","first_seen_on":"2013-03-20T15:59:48+00:00","issns":["1872-9452"],"issue":"2-3","journal":"Molecular Aspects of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1363795087,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23506872"],"pmid":"23506872","pubdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"SLC13 family of Na(+)-coupled di- and tri-carboxylate\/sulfate transporters.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/slc13-family-nacoupled-di-tricarboxylatesulfate-transporters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3548956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89670,"mean":6.5756191995005,"rank":70375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89670,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":3.511838150289,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.6958333333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
