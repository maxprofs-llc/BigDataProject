Deletions or mutations of the CYP21 gene induce the impairment of glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid synthesis. 17-Hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) is the hormonal marker in patients, but not in the heterozygous subjects. Excess 17-OHP is hydroxylated into 21-deoxycortisol (21-DF), and therefore 21-DF can be used as a specific marker for diagnosis of heterozygous individuals. We report an analytical method for analysis of 21-DF in blood samples using electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), showing that ESI is very sensitive for the analysis of this marker molecule. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) approach was used to increase the specificity and the sensitivity of the method.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086ec","authors":["Cristoni S","Cuccato D","Sciannamblo M","Bernardi LR","Biunno I","Gerthoux P","Russo G","Weber G","Mora S"],"doi":"10.1002\/rcm.1284","endpage":"82","first_seen_on":"2013-03-22T12:26:45+00:00","issns":["0951-4198","1097-0231"],"issue":"1","journal":"Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","last_mentioned_on":1481846506,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14689562","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14689562"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.1284\/pdf","pmid":"14689562","pubdate":"2003-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"77","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Analysis of 21-deoxycortisol, a marker of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, in blood by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and electrospray ionization using multiple reaction monitoring.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-21deoxycortisol-marker-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-blood-atmospheric-pressure-chemical-i-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7896890,"mean":6.6848881279648,"rank":1799198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6061727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7896890,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117370,"mean":6.5458549020611,"rank":27483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":89111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117370,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1710,"mean":1.5257963721475,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1710,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.44230769230769,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SimoneCristoni\/statuses\/315076687282978816","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1315812],"posted_on":"2013-03-22T12:25:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Simone Cristoni","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/kpo7yVLJVu","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_4_normal.png","id_on_source":"SimoneCristoni","tweeter_id":"421308920","geo":{"lt":42.23597,"ln":-8.44321,"country":"ES"},"followers":48},"tweet_id":"315076687282978816"}],"wikipedia":[{"title":"21-Deoxycortisol","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=755052480#altmetric_citation_08117098-2cd9-4be3-aa04-142619e30389","license":"public","citation_ids":[1315812,1315812],"posted_on":"2016-12-16T00:01:46+00:00","summary":"21-Deoxycortisol, also known as 11\u03b2,17\u03b1-dihydroxyprogesterone or as 11\u03b2,17\u03b1-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a naturally occurring, endogenous steroid related to cortisol (11\u03b2,17\u03b1,21-trihydroxyprogesterone) which is formed via 11\u03b2-hydroxylase from 17\u03b1-h","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=52598581","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Medgirl131","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Medgirl131"}}]}}
