The mechanisms regulating cholangiocyte proliferation are still undefined. Pancreatic Duodenal Homeobox protein 1 (PDX-1) is expressed by reactive cholangiocytes. In the adult pancreas, PDX-1 regulates the proliferative response to injury of ductal cells. Its effects can be counteracted by Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes-1). We aimed at studying whether PDX-1\/Hes-1 interactions regulate cholangiocyte proliferation in response to injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ddb","authors":["Marzioni M","Saccomanno S","Agostinelli L","Rychlicki C","Minicis SD","Pierantonelli I","Trauner M","Fickert P","M\u00fcller T","Shanmukhappa K","Trozzi L","Candelaresi C","Baroni GS","Benedetti A","Marco Marzioni","Stefania Saccomanno","Laura Agostinelli","Chiara Rychlicki","Samuele De Minicis","Irene Pierantonelli","Michael Trauner","Peter Fickert","Tobias M\u00fcller","Kumar Shanmukhappa","Luciano Trozzi","Cinzia Candelaresi","Gianluca Svegliati Baroni","Antonio Benedetti"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jhep.2012.11.033","endpage":"756","first_seen_on":"2013-03-22T20:27:20+00:00","issns":["0168-8278","01688278"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1504106056,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23207146","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jhep.2012.11.033","http:\/\/www.journal-of-hepatology.eu\/article\/S0168-8278(12)00903-8\/fulltext"],"pmid":"23207146","pubdate":"2012-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"750","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"PDX-1\/Hes-1 interactions determine cholangiocyte proliferative response to injury in rodents: Possible implications for sclerosing cholangitis","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pdx1hes1-interactions-determine-cholangiocyte-proliferative-response-injury-rodents-possible-implica"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":4268864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3963997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119880,"mean":6.7917613093203,"rank":54373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":61760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119880,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2365,"mean":9.0104906937394,"rank":1735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2365,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":8.96615,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
