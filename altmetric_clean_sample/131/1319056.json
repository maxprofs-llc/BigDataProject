However, research on school-based sex education is limited in many developing countries, including Nepal. This study thus had two main objectives: (1) to assess students' evaluation of school-based sex education, and (2) to examine the associations between students' evaluations of school-based sex education and their (a) attitudes toward abstinence and (b) intentions for safer sex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2458-13-244","first_seen_on":"2013-03-25T03:57:13+00:00","issns":["1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1365765363,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/13\/244\/abstract"],"pmid":"23509909","pubdate":"2013-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biostatistics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vaccine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"244","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Better learning in schools to improve attitudes toward abstinence and intentions for safer sex among adolescents in Urban Nepal","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/better-learning-schools-improve-attitudes-toward-abstinence-intentions-safer-sex-among-adolescents-u"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2281363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":2197399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89313,"mean":6.6131438328557,"rank":43460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":45091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89313,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5092,"mean":5.8067059516794,"rank":3509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5092,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298,"mean":4.7164646464646,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
