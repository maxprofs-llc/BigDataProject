Open surgery for fracture stabilization is often inappropriate in this population due to a poor risk-benefit profile, particularly if life expectancy is short. Percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are appealing adjunctive procedures in patients with malignancy for alleviation of intractable pain. However, these patients have higher risk of serious complications, notably cement extravasation. Described in this report is a case of a painful osteolytic vertebral metastasis that was successfully treated by a novel percutaneous vertebral augmentation system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef482a83ee09648b4766","authors":["Jon Block","Anselmetti","Tutton","Facchini","Miller"],"doi":"10.2147\/imcrj.s29569","first_seen_on":"2013-03-20T03:59:12+00:00","issns":["1179-142X"],"journal":"International Medical Case Reports Journal","last_mentioned_on":1363611600,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/percutaneous-vertebral-augmentation-for-painful-osteolytic-vertebral-m-peer-reviewed-article-IMCRJ"],"pmid":"23754917","pubdate":"2012-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"13","title":"Percutaneous vertebral augmentation for painful osteolytic vertebral metastasis: a case report","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/percutaneous-vertebral-augmentation-painful-osteolytic-vertebral-metastasis-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":869282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3868088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91545,"mean":6.7615679891637,"rank":17886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":73279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91545,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
