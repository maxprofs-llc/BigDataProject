These reactions appear constantly at the end of the 1st week, increase in intensity during the 2nd week, and remain demonstrable for a period of 2 to 4 months. They were most complete in the sera of patients suffering from postinfluenzal pneumonia. It has also been demonstrated that the strains of Pfeiffer's bacillus isolated during the epidemic were morphologically and biologically similar to the strains isolated from influenza cases in other years, and antigenically they differed from them only quantitatively. The patients' serological reactions indicate the parasitic nature of the bacillus, but are not sufficiently stable and clean-cut to signify that Pfeiffer's bacillus is the specific inciting agent of epidemic influenza. They do, however, indicate that the bacillus of Pfeiffer is at least a very common secondary invader in influenza, and that its presence influences the course of the pathological process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Wollstein, M"],"first_seen_on":"2013-03-24T17:37:03+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-1007"],"issue":"6","journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1364119680,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19868377"],"pmcid":"PMC2126671","pmid":"19868377","pubdate":"1919-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Rockefeller University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"PFEIFFER'S BACILLUS AND INFLUENZA : A SEROLOGICAL STUDY.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pfeiffers-bacillus-influenza-serological-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.264,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.264},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9523304688866,"rank":493182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3192582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85905,"mean":6.3429127398025,"rank":13623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":72281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85905,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2736,"mean":3.5005447897623,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2736,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":7.1666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"El &quot;home\u00f3pata homeop\u00e1tico&quot; y la bacteria que nunca existi\u00f3","url":"http:\/\/curiosidadesdelamicrobiologia.blogspot.co.uk\/2013\/03\/el-homeopata-homeopatico-y-la-bacteria.html","citation_ids":[13048362,1318469,1318470,1149313,13048366,1149313],"posted_on":"2013-03-24T10:08:00+00:00","summary":"Recientemente tuve que impartir unas \"pr&aacute;cticas de inform&aacute;tica\" dentro de la asignatura Microbiolog&iacute;a Industrial, de 2&ordm; curso del grado de Biotecnolog&iacute;a.
