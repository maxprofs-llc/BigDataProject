Despite their promising physicochemical and biological properties, the use of sophorolipids is hampered by the lack of information regarding their individual structure-activity relationships. The major difficulty in isolating pure sophorolipids arises from the high complexity of crude fermentation media composition and from their strong structural similarities. In this work, a centrifugal partition chromatography method was developed in an original gradient elution mode for the separation of sophorolipids produced by the yeast Candida bombicola. Experiments were realized by using three sets of solvent systems composed of n-heptane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, methanol, and water in different proportions. The separation was performed at 5 mL\/min in the ascending mode by increasing progressively the polarity of the organic mobile phase. In these conditions, more than 80% of the sophorolipids present in the initial crude fermentation extract were eluted successively from the most hydrophobic lactone forms to the most hydrophilic acid forms. The structures of the isolated sophorolipids were further elucidated by HPLC and NMR analyses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e43","authors":["Kotland, Alexis","Hadef, Imane","Renault, Jean\u2010Hugues","Hamzaoui, Mahmoud","Martinez, Agathe","Borie, Nicolas","Guilleret, Arnaud","Reynaud, Romain","Hubert, Jane"],"doi":"10.1002\/jssc.201201033","endpage":"1369","first_seen_on":"2013-03-20T11:34:42+00:00","issns":["1615-9314","1615-9306"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Separation Science (JSS) (formerly Journal of High Resolution Chromatography)","last_mentioned_on":1363779155,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jssc.201201033\/abstract;jsessionid=F36B3C89549EF2456FFAE18B5371BDD2.d04t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jssc.201201033\/pdf","pmid":"23520018","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1362","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"A gradient elution method in centrifugal partition chromatography for the separation of a complex sophorolipid mixture obtained from Candida bombicola yeasts","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gradient-elution-method-centrifugal-partition-chromatography-separation-complex-sophorolipid-mixture"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6287087,"mean":5.981417171326,"rank":4647456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":940799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6287087,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99088,"mean":6.8101641587696,"rank":66113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":18901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99088,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":634,"mean":1.1148151658768,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":634,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
