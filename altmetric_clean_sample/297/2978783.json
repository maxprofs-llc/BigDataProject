The complexes were found to release catecholate ligand in the presence of excess glutathione (GSH), resulting in cellular toxicity in the cancer cells. The catecholate complex [Pt(pap)(cat)] (3) was prepared and used as a control. Complex 3, which is structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography, has platinum(II) in a distorted square-planar geometry. The complexes are redox-active, showing responses near 0.6 and 1.0 V versus SCE in N,N-dimethylformamide\/0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate corresponding to a two-step catechol oxidation process and at -0.3 and -1.3 V for reduction of the pap ligand. Complex 1 showed remarkable light-induced cytotoxicity in HaCaT (human skin keratinocytes) and MCF-7 (human breast cancer) cells, giving IC50 value of \u223c5 \u03bcM in visible light of 400-700 nm and >40 \u03bcM in the dark. The 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) assay showed the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which seems to trigger apoptosis, as is evident from the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)\/propidium iodide (PI) assay. The fluorescence microscopic images showed significant nuclear localization of the complexes and free ligands. A mechanistic study revealed possible reduction of the coordinated azo bond of pap by cellular GSH, releasing the catecholate ligand and resulting in remarkable photochemotherapeutic action of the complexes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Koushambi Mitra"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic502317z","first_seen_on":"2014-12-12T18:56:05+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1418418724,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic502317z","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ic502317z"],"pmid":"25496358","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"2-(Phenylazo)pyridineplatinum(II) Catecholates Showing Photocytotoxicity, Nuclear Uptake, and Glutathione-Triggered Ligand Release","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/2phenylazopyridineplatinumii-catecholates-showing-photocytotoxicity-nuclear-uptake-glutathionetrigge"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4612541,"mean":5.4155781775695,"rank":2370349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1635798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4612541,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149592,"mean":8.3521428160785,"rank":75724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":55942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149592,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6093,"mean":1.0129569927774,"rank":1483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6093,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.5,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
