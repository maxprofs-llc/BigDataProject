However, no clear guidelines exist for defining the larynx and its substructures consistently on cross-sectional imaging. This study presents computed tomography (CT)- and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based guidelines for contouring laryngeal organs-at-risk (OARs).Materials and MethodsStandardized guidelines for delineating laryngeal OARs were devised and used to delineate on CT and MRI for head-and-neck cancer patients. Volumetric comparisons were performed to evaluate consistency and reproducibility of guideline-based contours.ResultsFor the initial 5 patients the mean CT and MRI based larynx volume did not differ significantly between imaging modalities; 34.39\u00bf\u00b1\u00bf9.85 vs. 35.01\u00bf\u00b1\u00bf9.47 (p\u00bf=\u00bf.09). There was no statistical difference between the CT based mean laryngeal volume in the subsequent 44 patients compared to the initial 5 patients outlined on CT and the MRI scan (p\u00bf=\u00bf0.53 and 0.62). The OAR volume for laryngeal substructures were not statistically different among patients or between imaging modalities. Once established, the guidelines were easy to follow.ConclusionThe guidelines developed provide a precise method for delineating laryngeal OARs. These guidelines need to be validated and clinical significance of outlining laryngeal substructures and dose-volume constraints should be investigated before routine implementation in clinic practice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000088f","doi":"10.1186\/s13014-014-0285-4","first_seen_on":"2014-12-11T01:10:54+00:00","issns":["1748-717X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Radiation Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1422415569,"links":["http:\/\/www.ro-journal.com\/content\/9\/1\/285\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4266916\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ro-journal.com\/content\/pdf\/s13014-014-0285-4.pdf","pmid":"25499048","pubdate":"2014-12-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"285","subjects":["neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Development of a standardized method for contouring the larynx and its substructures","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-standardized-method-contouring-larynx-substructures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4683775,"mean":5.7027612822493,"rank":1803092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2844613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4683775,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156753,"mean":8.3678999566196,"rank":50136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":105178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156753,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":873,"mean":2.1409174311927,"rank":223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":873,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":2.0303614457831,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
