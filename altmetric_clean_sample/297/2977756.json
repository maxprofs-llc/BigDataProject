The new complexes have the chemical composition [Ir(Ap)(\u03b7(5) -C5 Me5 )](+) , exist in the form of two isomers (1(+) and 2(+) ) and were isolated as salts of the BArF (-) anion (BArF =B[3,5-(CF3 )2 C6 H3 ]4 ). Four Ap ligands that differ in the nature of their bulky aryl substituents at the amido nitrogen atom and pyridinic ring were employed. In the presence of H2 , the electrophilicity of the Ir(III) centre of these complexes allows for a reversible prototropic rearrangement that changes the nature and coordination mode of the aminopyridinate ligand between the well-known \u03ba(2) -N,N'-bidentate binding in 1(+) and the unprecedented \u03ba-N,\u03b7(3) -pseudo-allyl-coordination mode in isomers 2(+) through activation of a benzylic C\uf8ffH bond and formal proton transfer to the amido nitrogen atom. Experimental and computational studies evidence that the overall rearrangement, which entails reversible formation and cleavage of H\uf8ffH, C\uf8ffH and N\uf8ffH bonds, is catalysed by dihydrogen under homogeneous conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Zamorano, Ana","Rend\u00f3n, Nuria","L\u00f3pez\u2010Serrano, Joaqu\u00edn","Valpuesta, Jos\u00e9 E.
