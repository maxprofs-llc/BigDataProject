Proteins both on the merozoite surface and secreted from the apical organelles (micronemes, rhoptries and dense granules) mediate the invasion of erythrocytes; some of the molecules have been regarded as targets in the development of an anti-malaria vaccine. Recently, a subgroup of rhoptry neck proteins (PfRON2, PfRON4 and PfRON5) associated with the microneme protein apical membrane antigen AMA1 has been described as components of the moving junction complex that assists merozoite invasion into erythrocytes. However, unlike PfRON2, PfRON4 and PfRON5, the latest study suggested that PfRON3 might be located in the rhoptry bulb and participates in a novel PfRON complex (PfRON2, 3 and 4), but does not form a complex with AMA1. Additionally, the full-length PfRON3 protein possesses three transmembrane regions at the N-terminus, which is highly conserved among RON3 orthologues in the genus Plasmodium, Toxoplasma gondii and Eimeria tenella. Overall, these findings suggest that PfRON3 may play an important role in merozoite invasion into erythrocytes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","authors":["Zhao X","Chang Z","Tu Z","Yu S","Wei X","Zhou J","Lu H","Jiang N","Chen Q"],"doi":"10.1186\/1475-2875-13-490","first_seen_on":"2014-12-12T21:38:04+00:00","issns":["1475-2875"],"issue":"1","journal":"Malaria Journal","last_mentioned_on":1433030825,"links":["http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/13\/1\/490\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25495792?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1475-2875-13-490.pdf","pmid":"25495792","pubdate":"2014-12-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"490","title":"PfRON3 is an erythrocyte-binding protein and a potential blood-stage vaccine candidate antigen.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pfron3-erythrocytebinding-protein-potential-bloodstage-vaccine-candidate-antigen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5165050,"mean":6.1002610805847,"rank":3411216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1537886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5165050,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180302,"mean":8.0482292277915,"rank":112035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":59746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180302,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2063,"mean":3.8933123181377,"rank":1485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2063,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":2.9043010752688,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
