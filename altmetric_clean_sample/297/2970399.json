Recently, interleukin-17 (IL-17), produced locally in the tumor microenvironment, has been reported to play a crucial role in tumor immunity. In this study, we determined that exposure of MM cells to IL-17 had various promotive influences on different aspects of tumor progression. IL-17 significantly induced cell proliferation, inhibited cellular apoptosis, repressed cell adhesion to fibronectin and collagen I, and facilitated cell migration. Exposure to IL-17 also resulted in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as evidenced by repression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, and induction of the mesenchymal marker Vimentin, and EMT transcription factors Snail and Slug. Further experiments showed that IL-17 activated the oncogenic p65 transcription factor, which directly repressed the miR-192 gene via binding to the miR-192 promoter. Loss of miR-192 in MM cells can mimic the effects of IL-17, and was required for the above oncogenic effects of IL-17 on MM. Furthermore, we found that miR-192, and its homologous miR-215 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated regions of IL-17Rs, including IL-17RA and RE mRNA. By examining bone marrow specimens derived from MM patients, a negative correlation between miR-192 expression and IL-17 or IL-17RA expression was observed. Also, IL-17 was negatively correlated with E-cadherin and positively with Vimentin. Taken together, our study provides evidence that the IL-17\/miR-192\/IL-17Rs regulatory feedback loop is manifest in MM and might represent a promising and efficient prognostic marker and therapeutic target for MM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yuanyuan Sun","Jing Pan","Shudan Mao","Jieping Jin"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0114647","first_seen_on":"2014-12-10T11:08:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1453961649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25489847?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25489847?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25489847","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"IL-17\/miR-192\/IL-17Rs Regulatory Feedback Loop Facilitates Multiple Myeloma Progression.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/il17mir192il17rs-regulatory-feedback-loop-facilitates-multiple-myeloma-progression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7059888,"mean":6.2742286087554,"rank":3086986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3812223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7059888,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232243,"mean":7.4043998673798,"rank":91450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":133248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232243,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103374,"mean":10.034385226317,"rank":49258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":49920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103374,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2461,"mean":14.669480487805,"rank":1208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2461,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
