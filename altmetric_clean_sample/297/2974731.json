Herein we report the preparation and ex vivo evaluation of a fluorinated SL25.1188 derivative as a candidate (18)F-labeled PET radiotracer. (S)-3-(6-(3-fluoropropoxy)benzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-5-(methoxy methyl)oxazolidin-2-one (1) was labeled with fluorine-18 in 51% uncorrected radiochemical yield having high radiochemical purity (>98%) and specific activity (109\u00b126GBq\/\u03bcmol). Ex vivo biodistribution studies demonstrated low radioactivity retention, specific binding and metabolic stability within rat brains. High uptake of radioactivity in bone is consistent with metabolic defluorination. In vitro binding assays of longer chain fluoroalkoxy derivatives revealed that the length of the carbon chain is an integral feature in MAO-B inhibitor potency and selectivity within this scaffold.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Justin W Hicks","Oleg Sadovski","Jun Parkes","Sylvain Houle","Bruce A Hay","Randall L Carter","Alan A Wilson","Neil Vasdev"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2014.11.048","first_seen_on":"2014-12-11T13:13:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-3405"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1418302553,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25488845"],"pmid":"25488845","pubdate":"2014-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Radiosynthesis and ex vivo evaluation of [(18)F]-(S)-3-(6-(3-fluoropropoxy)benzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-5-(methoxymethyl)oxazolidin-2-one for imaging MAO-B with PET.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiosynthesis-ex-vivo-evaluation-18fs363fluoropropoxybenzodisoxazol3yl5methoxymethyloxazolidin2one"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4609954,"mean":5.4262342220142,"rank":3158071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":872865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4609954,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149735,"mean":8.3659782280579,"rank":100338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":32303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149735,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1624,"mean":2.1321565003081,"rank":944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1624,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":0.85162162162162,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PeertechzJourna\/status\/543026382003896321","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2974731],"posted_on":"2014-12-11T12:55:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Peertechz Pub PvtLtd","url":"https:\/\/www.peertechz.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/808685119959535616\/cV4vMlOy_normal.jpg","description":"Peertechz Publications Pvt.
