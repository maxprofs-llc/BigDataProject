By application of a catalytic metallodrug strategy, a copper-acridine-ATCUN complex (CuGGHK-Acr) has been designed that targets G-quadruplex telomeric DNA. Both fluorescence solution assays and gel sequencing demonstrate the CuGGHK-Acr catalyst to selectively bind and cleave the G-quadruplex telomere sequence. The cleavage pathway has been mapped by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) experiments. CuGGHK-Acr promotes significant inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and shortening of telomere length. Both senescence and apoptosis are induced in the breast cancer cell line MCF7.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Yu, Zhen","Han, Menglu","Cowan, James A."],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201410434","endpage":"1905","first_seen_on":"2014-12-11T18:07:28+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"6","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
