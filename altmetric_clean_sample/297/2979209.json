Clinical trials with S. aureus specific antibodies failed to protect VLBW neonates, which may be due to the immune evasive attributes of staphylococcal protein A (SpA). Here we show that mouse monoclonal antibody SpAKKAA-mAb 3F6, which neutralizes the immunoglobulin Fc\u03b3-binding and B cell receptor crosslinking attributes of SpA, protects neonatal mice against S. aureus sepsis and raises protective immunity against subsequent staphylococcal infection. We developed a humanized SpAKKAA-mAb that protects neonatal mice against S. aureus sepsis and may therefore be subjected to clinical testing in VLBW neonates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2014.11.051","first_seen_on":"2014-12-12T22:36:28+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["0264410X"],"journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1422480652,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0264410X14016089"],"pmid":"25488332","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Protein A-neutralizing monoclonal antibody protects neonatal mice against Staphylococcus aureus ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-aneutralizing-monoclonal-antibody-protects-neonatal-mice-against-staphylococcus-aureus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.172,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.172},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4684537,"mean":5.7037924242674,"rank":560212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":4124298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4684537,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156533,"mean":8.3870754861628,"rank":24143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":132390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156533,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3282,"mean":5.2921286193234,"rank":359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":2922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3282,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":11.055422222222,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
