In addition to such evolution of a target stock, the corresponding fishery itself may adapt, in terms of fishing policy, technological progress, fleet dynamics, and adaptive harvest. The aim of this study is to assess how the interplay between natural and artificial selection, in the simplest setting in which a fishery and a target stock coevolve, can lead to disruptive selection, which in turn may cause trait diversification. To this end, we build an eco-evolutionary model for a size-structured population, in which both the stock\u05f3s maturation schedule and the fishery\u05f3s harvest rate are adaptive, while fishing may be subject to a selective policy based on fish size and\/or maturity stage. Using numerical bifurcation analysis, we study how the potential for disruptive selection changes with fishing policy, fishing mortality, harvest specialization, life-history tradeoffs associated with early maturation, and other demographic and environmental parameters. We report the following findings. First, fisheries-induced disruptive selection is readily caused by commonly used fishing policies, and occurs even for policies that are not specific for fish size or maturity, provided that the harvest is sufficiently adaptive and large individuals are targeted intensively. Second, disruptive selection is more likely in stocks in which the selective pressure for early maturation is naturally strong, provided life-history tradeoffs are sufficiently consequential. Third, when a fish stock is overexploited, fisheries targeting only large individuals might slightly increase sustainable yield by causing trait diversification (even though the resultant yield always remains lower than the maximum sustainable yield that could be obtained under low fishing mortality, without causing disruptive selection). We discuss the broader implications of our results and highlight how these can be taken into account for designing evolutionarily informed fisheries-management regimes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f77","doi":"10.1016\/j.jtbi.2014.10.017","first_seen_on":"2014-12-11T05:12:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00225193"],"journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1424249805,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022519314006067","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022519314006067#.VORTZBnlsts.facebook"],"pmid":"25451962","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Fisheries-induced disruptive selection ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fisheriesinduced-disruptive-selection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4778173,"mean":5.7247390918571,"rank":1095627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3669705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4778173,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163609,"mean":8.1932114077553,"rank":43213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":119766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163609,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1561,"mean":3.2232025641026,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":1260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1561,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":9.351875,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
