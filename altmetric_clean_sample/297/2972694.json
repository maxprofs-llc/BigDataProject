Using data gathered from school-based gatekeeper trainings implemented by GLS grantees, this analysis examines training and gatekeeper factors associated with (1) identification and referral patterns and (2) services at-risk youths receive. Time spent interacting with youths was positively correlated with the number of gatekeeper identifications and knowledge about service receipt. Gatekeepers who participated in longer trainings identified proportionately more at-risk youths than participants in shorter trainings. Most gatekeeper trainees referred the identified youths to services regardless of training type.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035e9","authors":["Susanne Condron D","Garraza LG","Walrath CM","McKeon R","Goldston DB","Heilbron NS","Susanne Condron, Donna","Garraza, Lucas Godoy","Walrath, Christine M.","McKeon, Richard","Goldston, David B.","Heilbron, Nicole S.","Donna Susanne Condron","Lucas Godoy Garraza","Christine M.
