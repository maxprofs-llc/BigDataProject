Much research in this emerging field is centered at the intersection of serious games, alternative realities, and play therapy. In this paper the authors describe their transdisciplinary work at this intersection: i) an integrative system of psychotherapy technologies called MyPsySpace currently being prototyped in Second Life with the aim of offering new and virtual translations of traditional expressive therapies (virtual sandplay, virtual drama therapy, digital expressive therapy, and virtual safe spaces) and ii) a mature body of research entitled SoundScapes that is exploring the use of interactive video games and abstract creative expression (making music, digital painting, and robotic device control) as a supplement to traditional physical rehabilitation intervention. Aside from introducing our work to a broader audience, our goal is to encourage peers to investigate ideas that reach across disciplines-to both risk and reap the benefits of combining technologies, theories, and methods stemming from multiple disciplines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67f3cf058f6100098a4","authors":["Sheryl Brahnam","Anthony L Brooks","Brahnam S","Brooks AL"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-10T11:06:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0926-9630"],"journal":"Studies in Health Technology & Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1491906729,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25488221?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25488221","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25488221?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25488221","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Two innovative healthcare technologies at the intersection of serious games, alternative realities, and play therapy.","type":"article","volume":"207","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/technologies-inclusive-wellbeing-intersection-serious-games-alternative-realities-play-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":3367712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4639751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239642,"mean":7.6702492812166,"rank":80440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":156790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239642,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1117,"mean":1.6978476702509,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1117,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.6875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
