Although the separation of mixtures of atomically precise gold clusters Au25L18, where L are thiolates, has been demonstrated by advanced separation techniques, we present here the first separation of metal clusters by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), which is simple yet surprisingly efficient. This method was successfully applied to a binary mixture of Au25L18 with different ligands, as well as to a binary mixture of different cluster cores, Au25 and Au144, protected with the same ligand. Importantly, TLC even enabled the challenging separation of a multicomponent mixture of mixed-monolayer-protected Au25 clusters with closely similar chemical ligand compositions. We anticipate that the realization of such simple yet efficient separation technique will progress the detailed investigation of cluster properties.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Atanu Ghosh"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac503165t","first_seen_on":"2014-12-11T05:28:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0003-2700"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1419514250,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ac503165t","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac503165t"],"pmid":"25395064","pubdate":"2014-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Simple and Efficient Separation of Atomically Precise Noble Metal Clusters.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simple-efficient-separation-atomically-precise-noble-metal-clusters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":446616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4240171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153167,"mean":8.2428241124011,"rank":20298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":132544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153167,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5204,"mean":2.6235860080723,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":5006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5204,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":2.6704314720812,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
