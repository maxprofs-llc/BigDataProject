This study explores family and community risk and protective factors relevant to alcohol and illegal drug misuse in 1,778 Thai teenagers. Strong family attachment and a family history of antisocial behaviors were strongly associated with nearly all forms of substance abuse, with adjusted ORs ranging from 5.05 to 8.45. Community disorganization was strongly associated with self-reported substance use, although involvement in prosocial activities acted as a protective factor. The findings suggest that interventions that promote family cohesion and encourage community involvement may have considerable benefits in reducing substance abuse in Thai adolescents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000169b","authors":["Nualnong Wongtongkam","Paul Russell Ward","Andrew Day","Anthony Harold Winefield","Wongtongkam N","Ward PR","Day A","Winefield AH"],"doi":"10.1080\/10550887.2014.975616","endpage":"121","first_seen_on":"2014-12-11T17:29:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"11541.2\/114824","handles":["11541.2\/114824"],"issns":["1545-0848","1055-0887"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Addictive Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1432688521,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25491376?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10550887.2014.975616","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/10550887.2014.975616"],"pmid":"25491376","pubdate":"2014-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Routledge","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"112","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Exploring Family and Community Involvement to Protect Thai Youths from Alcohol and Illegal Drug Abuse","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/10550887.2014.975616","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-family-community-involvement-protect-thai-youths-alcohol-illegal-drug-abuse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5153580,"mean":6.0936326223025,"rank":2543433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2455693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5153580,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180359,"mean":8.0321849321906,"rank":81673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":90897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180359,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177,"mean":3.7926704545455,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.95,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
