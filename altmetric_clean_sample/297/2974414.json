This was characterized by routine physicochemical studies, single crystal X-ray diffraction and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. The structure analysis reveals that there are copper centres in two different environments, a slightly distorted square planar and a distorted square-pyramidal, arranged in binuclear units. The EPR study of these binuclear units performed at 9.4 GHz in the temperature range between 4 and 293 K shows an antiferromagnetic interaction between Cu(II) ions, and allows evaluating g factors gx = 2.068(1), gy = 2.091(1) and gz = 2.165(1), with <g> = 2.108(1), an exchange coupling parameter J0 = -26(1) cm(-1) (defined as ), and a zero field splitting of the ground triplet state described by D = 86(2) \u00d7 10(-4) cm(-1) and E = -48(3) \u00d7 10(-4) cm(-1). These results are discussed and compared with the existing literature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Narjes Khadir","Davar M.
