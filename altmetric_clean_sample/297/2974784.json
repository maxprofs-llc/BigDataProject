In 1923, 27-year old Alfred (already a dentist), arrived in Indianapolis, Indiana, ostensibly to study \"advanced dental practice\" at the Indiana Dental College. However, his primary motive for coming to Indianapolis was to participate in the Indy 500 race. On Friday, May 30, 1924, 22 car racers started the 12th running of the Indy 500. Among them was Alfred, who finished respectably, in 16th place. Thus, he became the first dentist to compete in the famed Indianapolis 500 race. In 1925, after months of dirt-track running around the U.S., he returned to England. His initial plan was to continue racing in his own country. However, this goal vanished as his dental career began to flourish. Soon he had developed a large and prosperous dental practice in London. In 1927, Moss married Aileen Craufurd, who eventually became a champion female race car driver in England. In 1929, the couple had a son, Stirling. By the 1950s, Stirling Moss was hailed as Britain's best known sports star, and one of the world's fastest and most versatile race drivers of all time. This article follows the life and times of the Moss family, with an emphasis on Alfred's two life endeavors racing and dentistry, and on Stirling's famed racing career. In 1999, Stirling Moss was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ebf","authors":["Christen JA"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-11T13:27:47+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of the History of Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1418304422,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15926657"],"pmid":"15926657","pubdate":"2005-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","historyofmedicine"],"title":"Alfred E.
