The Kern Canyon serogroup comprises a loosely connected set of rhabdoviruses many of which have been isolated from bats, including Kern Canyon virus from California, Nkolbisson virus from Cameroon, Central African Republic, and Cote d'Ivoire, Kolente virus from Guinea, Mount Elgon bat and Fikirini viruses from Kenya, and Oita virus from Japan. Fukuoka virus isolated from mosquitoes, midges, and cattle in Japan, Barur virus from a rodent in India and Nishimuro virus from pigs in Japan have also been linked genetically or serologically to this group. Here, we analyze the genome sequences and phylogenetic relationships of this set of viruses. We show that they form three sub-groups within a monophyletic group, which we propose should constitute the new genus Ledantevirus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006990","authors":["Kim R Blasdell","Hilda Guzman","Steven G Widen","Cadhla Firth","Thomas G Wood","Edward C Holmes","Robert B Tesh","Nikos Vasilakis","Peter J Walker"],"doi":"10.4269\/ajtmh.14-0606","endpage":"410","first_seen_on":"2014-12-10T11:19:02+00:00","funders":["niehs","phs","niaid"],"issns":["1476-1645","0002-9637"],"issue":"2","journal":"The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1424297223,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25487727?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ajtmh.org\/content\/92\/2\/405.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25487727"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajtmh.org\/content\/92\/2\/405.full.pdf","pmid":"25487727","pubdate":"2014-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"405","title":"Ledantevirus: A Proposed New Genus in the Rhabdoviridae Has A Strong Ecological Association with Bats.","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ledantevirus-proposed-new-genus-rhabdoviridae-strong-ecological-association-bats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5435453,"mean":6.3252946496427,"rank":3599260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1610153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5435453,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186767,"mean":8.0940255613979,"rank":116304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":61893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186767,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1964,"mean":4.9494701986755,"rank":1340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1964,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":6.2358507462687,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
