Targeted treatments against solid tumors generally lead to dramatic regressions, but, unfortunately, the responses are often short-lived due to resistant cancer cells. In addition, one of the major challenges of combination drug therapy (called 'cocktail') is the crucial optimization of different drug parameters. This issue can be solved using combination nanotherapy. Nanoparticles developed in oncology based on combination nanotherapy are either: a) those designed to combat multidrug resistance; or b) those to circumvent resistance to clinical cancer drugs. This review provides an overview of the different nanoparticles currently used in clinical treatments in oncology. We analyze in detail the development of combinatorial nanoparticles including dendrimers for dual drug delivery via two strategic approaches: a) use of chemotherapeutics and chemosensitizers to combat multidrug resistance b) use of multiple cytotoxic drugs. Finally, in this review, we discuss the challenges, clinical outlook and perspectives of the nanoparticle-based combination therapy in cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e5","authors":["Serge Mignani"],"doi":"10.1021\/bm501285t","first_seen_on":"2014-12-12T21:09:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-7797"],"journal":"Biomacromolecules","last_mentioned_on":1418418556,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/bm501285t?ref=tw&hootPostID=b4c500cbe2bf9651479c9d33f72928b2&"],"pmid":"25426779","pubdate":"2014-11-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Advances in Combination Therapies Based on Nanoparticles for Efficacious Cancer Treatment: An Analytical Report","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/advances-combination-therapies-based-nanoparticles-efficacious-cancer-treatment-analytical-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4612582,"mean":5.4149131655012,"rank":2370279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1635891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4612582,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149592,"mean":8.3532171855259,"rank":75732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":55934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149592,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":645,"mean":3.851049689441,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":645,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":2.3435862068966,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
