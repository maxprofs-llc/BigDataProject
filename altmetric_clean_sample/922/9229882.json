A community sample of 1,003 women filled in the questionnaires and instruments, which included the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales and the Life Events Survey; sociodemographic, health, and menopause-related and lifestyle information was also collected. Structural equation modeling was used to build the model that had stress and depressive mood as dependent variables. Health status (both physical and psychological), recent life events, income and menopausal phase were significantly associated with the frequency of stress and depressive symptoms. Additionally, educational level and parity were also significant predictors of depressive mood. This study emphasizes that psychological symptoms occurrence in midlife depends not only on personal variables (such as health and menopausal status) but also on contextual ones (including recent stressful events) that can be a strong influence on how middle-aged women feel.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000140d","authors":["Pimenta, Filipa","Maroco, Jo\u00e3o","Leit\u00e3o, Mafalda","Leal, Isabel"],"doi":"10.1080\/08952841.2015.1018058","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2016-07-05T09:52:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1540-7322","0895-2841"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Women &amp; Aging","last_mentioned_on":1467673457,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27351694\/?i=5&from=menopause%20symptoms"],"pmid":"27351694","pubdate":"2016-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Predictors of stress and depressive mood in Portuguese middle-aged women","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictors-stress-depressive-mood-portuguese-middleaged-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":6910352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260207,"mean":11.509890832648,"rank":218627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260207,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128,"mean":4.9240787401575,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.6590909090909,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
