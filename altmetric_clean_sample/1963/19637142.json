The clinical significance of AMA positivity in patients with normal cholestatic liver enzymes is uncertain.\nCharts of patients with normal cholestatic liver enzymes and AMA positivity that underwent liver biopsy between 2012-2015 were retrospectively analysed.\nSix AMA-positive patients with normal cholestatic liver enzymes who underwent a liver biopsy were identified. Four (67%) showed florid bile duct lesion compatible with early-stage PBC, while two others presented mild and non-specific histological findings. The patients with histological findings compatible with PBC had higher ELISA-determined AMA titers and significantly elevated IgM level, whereas patients with nonspecific histological findings (33%) had low-titer AMA and a borderline elevated IgM level.\nAMA-positive patients with normal cholestatic liver enzymes should be meticulously evaluated for PBC including the performance of a liver biopsy, mainly in patients with high-titer seropositivity for AMA and a significantly elevated IgM level. More studies are required to clarify the role of a liver biopsy in these patients and further follow-up may elucidate the relationship of these patients to those with the more classical forms of PBC.
