Novel animal and human studies indicate that curcumin can affect different immune cells, such as various T lymphocyte subsets, macrophages, dendritic cells, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells, which results in decreasing severity of various diseases with immunological etiology. The present review provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of curcumin on different immune cells and immune system-related diseases. This article is protected by copyright.
