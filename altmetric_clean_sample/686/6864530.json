There is increasing evidence that EMT, in which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal and migratory properties, may also play a role in the establishment of the disease. EMT induced by HIF-1\u03b1 has been reported to play a role in the development of many tumor types.\nWe investigated expression changes of N-cadherin, E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, HIF-1\u03b1 and vimentin using immunohistochemistry in normal, eutopic and ectopic endometria. Endometrial tissues from 96 additional females without related pathology were collected, and these tissues were subjected to subsequent primary cell culture for further experiments.\nThe expression of N-cadherin, E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, HIF-1\u03b1 and vimentin in 20 normal, 21 eutopic and 21 ectopic endometrial samples was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Human primary endometrial epithelial cells were isolated from 96 normal endometrial tissues. Times for hypoxia treatment for western blot analysis were 1, 2, 4 and 8 h, for transwell experiments was 48 h. Ishikawa cells were used instead of primary endometrial epithelial cells for transfection and part of the transwell experiments. The impact of hypoxia on invasion was evaluated by transwell assays. Overexpression and inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 were achieved by transfection of pG\/CMV\/HIF-1\u03b1\/IRES\/EGFP and MCS-shHIF-1\u03b1-EGFP-IRES plasmids separately. The effect of hypoxia, overexpression and knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 on hypoxia-induced changes of EMT markers and \u03b2-catenin were analyzed by western blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\nOverexpression of HIF-1\u03b1 and changes associated with EMT were observed in normal, eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues. Primary cultured human endometrial epithelial cells responded to hypoxia with classic EMT changes (fibroblastoid phenotype, increased expression of snail family zinc finger 1, \u03b2-catenin and mesenchymal markers, and decreased expression of E-cadherin) and increased invasiveness. The decreased invasiveness of Ishikawa cells by knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 was observed under hypoxic conditions. While up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 induced changes characteristic of EMT, down-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 had the opposite effect. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.\nA weakness of this study is the relatively small sample size for immunohistochemistry. Ishikawa cells were used instead of primary endometrial epithelial cells for transfection and part of the transwell experiments.\nHypoxia-stabilized HIF-1\u03b1 may play an important role in the invasion of endometrial cells in ectopic endometrial lesions, and it may induce EMT in the development of endometriosis. HIF-1\u03b1 may be a new and important target for the endometriosis treatment.\nThis study was funded by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (grant number 81170545 and 81471439).
