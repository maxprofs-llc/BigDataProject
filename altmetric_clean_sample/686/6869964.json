TACS at 1\u2009mA peak-to-peak was administered during a reward-punishment reversal learning task. Resting state EEG was measured before and after tACS and the task.\nActive tACS improved learning ability, but at the same time interfered with applying the rule to optimize behavior. Furthermore, a significant decrease in frontal theta-beta EEG ratios was observed following active tACS.\nResults provide behavioral and electrophysiological evidence for influencing reversal learning with exogenous oscillatory electric field potentials applied to the frontal cortex.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006ce7","authors":["Miles Wischnewski","Paul Zerr","Dennis J.L.G.
