For the IL-12 (-1188) A\/C polymorphism, 78 patients and 90 healthy individuals were analyzed. An increase in the AA genotype was determined (p\u2009=\u20090.02, OR\u2009=\u20092.06). There was also a statistically significant difference between the control group and the patients with respect to the allele frequencies (p\u2009=\u20090.04, OR\u2009=\u20091.65). For the IFN-\u03b3 (+874) A\/T polymorphism, 69 SSPE patients and 115 controls were studied and there was not a significant difference between the two groups. Our findings suggested that not the IFN-\u03b3 (+874) A\/T but the IL-12 (-1188) A\/C polymorphism is correlated with SSPE and having an AA genotype or A allele decreases the risk of developing SSPE by 2.06- and 1.65-fold, respectively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e7c","authors":["Nihal Olgac Dundar","Pinar Gencpinar","Nilgun Sallakci","Ozgur Duman","Senay Haspolat","Banu Anlar","Olcay Yegin","Dundar, Nihal Olgac","Gencpinar, Pinar","Sallakci, Nilgun","Duman, Ozgur","Haspolat, Senay","Anlar, Banu","Yegin, Olcay"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13365-016-0442-7","first_seen_on":"2016-04-21T18:32:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1538-2443","1355-0284"],"journal":"Journal of NeuroVirology","last_mentioned_on":1461432610,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs13365-016-0442-7","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27103395?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs13365-016-0442-7.pdf","pmid":"27103395","pubdate":"2016-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Interleukin-12 (-1188) A\/C and interferon-\u03b3 (+874) A\/T gene polymorphisms in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interleukin12-1188-ac-interferon%CE%B3-874-gene-polymorphisms-subacute-sclerosing-panencephalitis-patient"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":3366758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4149843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267111,"mean":11.299708554528,"rank":115376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":147317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267111,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":411,"mean":2.2834634146341,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":411,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.1552,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JNeuroVirology\/statuses\/723217790405120004","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6864659],"posted_on":"2016-04-21T18:32:12+00:00","author":{"name":"J NeuroVirology","url":"http:\/\/www.jneurovirol.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000074501119\/d3de050e6d55598c0f146c9290068879_normal.jpeg","description":"The Journal of NeuroVirology is the official peer-reviewed journal of the International Society for NeuroVirology.","id_on_source":"JNeuroVirology","tweeter_id":"1561383138","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":126},"tweet_id":"723217790405120004"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/723474269611532289","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6864659],"posted_on":"2016-04-22T11:31:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"723474269611532289"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/723926954810871808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6864659],"posted_on":"2016-04-23T17:30:10+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
