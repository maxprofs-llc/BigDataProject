Treatment strategies do not always follow evidence-based guidelines in outpatient settings. Data on pharmacotherapy in inpatient settings are lacking.\nPrescription data for inpatients suffering from OCD in the time period 1994-2012 were obtained from the database of the Drug Safety Program in Psychiatry (AMSP). Data were collected on two index dates per year; the prescription patterns and changes over time were analysed.\nOf 842 patients 89.9% received at least one psychotropic drug and 67.6% a combination of at least two psychotropic drugs. The drug groups prescribed most often were antidepressants (78.0%), antipsychotics (46.7%), and tranquilizers (19.7%). In 58.0% of all cases selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were used as antidepressants, followed by tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs, 17.8%), mainly clomipramine (10.9%). Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) were administered in 37.8% of all cases, first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) in 13.7%. While the use over time significantly increased for psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, antipsychotics, tranquilizers, SSRIs and SGAs, it remained stable for FGAs and decreased for TCAs.\nObservational cross-sectional study without follow-up or additional information.\nIn clinical practice, most OCD patients received pharmacological treatment. The high prescription rate of SSRIs and their preference over clomipramine as well as the augmentation of this therapy with SGAs comply with the guidelines. Administration of tranquilizers as well as sedative FGAs and the choice of single SGAs are not in line with expert recommendations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c6c","authors":["Christine Poppe","Sabrina T.
