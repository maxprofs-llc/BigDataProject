However, few studies have been conducted in Uyghur populations. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association of KIAA0319 polymorphisms and DD in individuals of Uyghurian descent. We used a custom-by-design 48-Plex SNPscan Kit to genotype 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of KIAA0319 in a group of 196 children with dyslexia and 196 controls of Uyghur descent aged 8-12 years. As a result, 7 SNPs (Pmin=0.001) of KIAA0319 had nominal significant differences between the cases and controls under specific genotypic models. The two SNPs rs6935076 (P=0.020 under dominant model; P=0.028 under additive model) and rs3756821 (P=0.021 under additive model) remained significantly associated with dyslexia after Bonferroni correction. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed three blocks within KIAA0319, and only a 10-SNP haplotype in block 3 was present at significantly different frequencies in the dyslexic children and controls. This study indicated that genetic polymorphisms of KIAA0319 are associated with an increased risk of DD in the Uyghur population.Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 21 April 2016; doi:10.1038\/jhg.2016.40.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002de4","authors":["Hua Zhao","Yun Chen","Bao-ping Zhang","Peng-xiang Zuo"],"doi":"10.1038\/jhg.2016.40","first_seen_on":"2016-04-21T19:53:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1434-5161","1435-232X"],"journal":"Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1491560294,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/jhg\/rss\/aop\/~3\/XhADuN9gsWs\/jhg.2016.40","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27098879?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27098879","pubdate":"2016-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetic association study","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Mutation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"KIAA0319 gene polymorphisms are associated with developmental dyslexia in Chinese Uyghur children","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kiaa0319-gene-polymorphisms-associated-developmental-dyslexia-chinese-uyghur-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":6924553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270604,"mean":11.348954039682,"rank":226685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270604,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":838,"mean":5.5375364396655,"rank":780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":838,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":4.9295625,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
