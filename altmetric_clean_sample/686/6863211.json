Here we report the application of nondestructive energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis to the sourcing of Polynesian artifacts made from basalt, one of the most ubiquitous materials in Polynesian archaeological sites. We have compared excavated and surface-collected basalt adzes and adze flakes from two sites in Samoa (site AS-13-1) and the Cook Islands (site MAN-44), with source basalts from known prehistoric quarries in these archipelagoes. In both cases, we are able to demonstrate the importing of basalt adzes from Tutuila Island, a distance of 100 km to Ofu Island, and of 1600 km to Mangaia Island. These findings are of considerable significance for Polynesian prehistory, as they demonstrate the movement of objects not only between islands in the same group (where communities were culturally and linguistically related) but also between distant island groups. Further applications of EDXRF analysis should greatly aid archaeologists in their efforts to reconstruct ancient trade and exchange networks, not only in Polynesia but also in other regions where basalt was a major material for artifact production.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["M I Weisler","P V Kirch"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-21T16:35:08+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"4","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1461340198,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/93\/4\/1381.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/93\/4\/1381.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC39946","pmid":"8643640","pubdate":"1996-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Interisland and interarchipelago transfer of stone tools in prehistoric Polynesia.","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interisland-interarchipelago-transfer-stone-tools-prehistoric-polynesia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":29,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":29},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":259399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7328111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267081,"mean":11.299003504568,"rank":16361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":250690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267081,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44383,"mean":22.602228741382,"rank":6381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":37994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44383,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":936,"mean":69.157597860963,"rank":311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":936,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
