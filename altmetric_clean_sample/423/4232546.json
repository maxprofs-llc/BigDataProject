Prussian blue analogue Gd(H2O)4[Fe(CN)6], a metal organic framework that crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, is used for the first time as a sacrificial template by a reaction with soluble silicate. Simultaneous and stoichiometric condensation of gadolinium hydroxide and silica takes place, leading to dense and monodispersed nanoparticles that preserve the original shape and size of the Prussian blue analogue crystals. Then, porosity is developed by incorporation of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide under hydrothermal conditions. The obtained Gd-Si mesoporous oxide particles present a dual morphology of nanocrosses and nanorods and large surface areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["ALEJANDRO CABRERA-GARCIA","ALEJANDRO VIDAL MOYA","ANGELA BERNABEU SANZ","JAVIER SANCHEZ GONZALEZ","EDUARDO FERNANDEZ","PABLO BOTELLA ASUNCION","Alejandro Cabrera-Garc\u00eda","Alejandro Vidal-Moya","\u00c1ngela Bernabeu","Javier S\u00e1nchez-Gonz\u00e1lez","Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez","Pablo Botella"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5dt01928a","endpage":"14041","first_seen_on":"2015-07-01T16:01:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"31","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1435783449,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C5DT01928A"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/dt\/c5dt01928a","pmid":"26165691","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"14034","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Gd-Si Oxide Mesoporous Nanoparticles with Pre-Formed Morphology Prepared from Prussian Blue Analogue Template","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gdsi-oxide-mesoporous-nanoparticles-preformed-morphology-prepared-prussian-blue-analogue-template"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5302459,"mean":6.2251135100008,"rank":2815000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1799863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5302459,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187434,"mean":8.4078228593685,"rank":103185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":65866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187434,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9256,"mean":0.634490545651,"rank":1269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9256,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":485,"mean":0.50816115702479,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":485,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
