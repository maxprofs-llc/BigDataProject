The predesigned semi-rigid hexacarboxylate ligand hexa[4-(carboxyphenyl)oxamethyl]-3-oxapentane acid (H6 L) has been adapted with various space-directed N\u2005donors (i.e., 2,2'-bipyridine, 4,4'-di(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl, and 1,3,5-tri(1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzene) from a bidentate V-shape to a tridentate Y-shape. This family of multifunctional MOF materials represents a variety of potential applications in the following aspects: first, as luminescent sensors that show a fast and sensitive detection for pollutant CrO4 (2-) and Cr2 O7 (2-) ions in aqueous media; second, as adsorbents that can rapidly remove harmful organic dyes; third, as an antenna that can effectively sensitize visible-light-emitting Tb(3+) ions. These multifunctional MOF materials combine optical-sensing, adsorption, and sensitization properties, thus are very useful in many potential applications. Furthermore, these materials have proved to be reusable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Yi, Fei\u2010Yan","Li, Jian\u2010Ping","Wu, Dai","Sun, Zhong\u2010Ming"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201500595","endpage":"11482","first_seen_on":"2015-07-01T21:15:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"32","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1435799769,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201500595\/abstract;jsessionid=B1CA367513F30D81B708EE87E6EE061D.f03t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201500595\/pdf","pmid":"26136119","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"11475","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A Series of Multifunctional Metal\u2013Organic Frameworks Showing Excellent Luminescent Sensing, Sensitization, and Adsorbent Abilities","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/series-multifunctional-metalorganic-frameworks-showing-excellent-luminescent-sensing-sensitization-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6399769,"mean":5.9838482607491,"rank":4496347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1670415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6399769,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189481,"mean":8.4791871859827,"rank":122073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":58525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189481,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3038,"mean":3.5444484688838,"rank":1685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3038,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":2.0884848484848,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
