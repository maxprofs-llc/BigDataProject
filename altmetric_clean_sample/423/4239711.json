Also, the Arabidopsis thaliana BDCP SPIRRIG (SPI) is important for membrane integrity, as spi mutants exhibit split vacuoles. In this work, we report a novel molecular function of the BDCP SPI in ribonucleoprotein particle formation. We show that SPI interacts with the P-body core component DECAPPING PROTEIN 1 (DCP1), associates to mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies), and regulates their assembly upon salt stress. The finding that spi mutants exhibit salt hypersensitivity suggests that the local function of SPI at P-bodies is of biological relevance. Transcriptome-wide analysis revealed qualitative differences in the salt stress-regulated transcriptional response of Col-0 and spi. We show that SPI regulates the salt stress-dependent post-transcriptional stabilization, cytoplasmic agglomeration, and localization to P-bodies of a subset of salt stress-regulated mRNAs. Finally, we show that the PH-BEACH domains of SPI and its human homolog FAN (Factor Associated with Neutral sphingomyelinase activation) interact with DCP1 isoforms from plants, mammals, and yeast, suggesting the evolutionary conservation of an association of BDCPs and P-bodies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003348","authors":["Steffens, Alexandra","Br\u00e4utigam, Andrea","Jakoby, Marc","H\u00fclskamp, Martin","Alexandra Steffens","Andrea Br\u00e4utigam","Marc Jakoby","Martin H\u00fclskamp","Xuemei Chen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pbio.1002188","first_seen_on":"2015-07-03T12:01:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1545-7885"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS Biology","last_mentioned_on":1460628143,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26133670","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosbiology\/article?id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1002188","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26133670?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosbiology\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1002188","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26133670?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26133670"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosbiology\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pbio.1002188&type=printable","pmid":"26133670","pubdate":"2015-07-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"The BEACH Domain Protein SPIRRIG Is Essential for Arabidopsis Salt Stress Tolerance and Functions as a Regulator of Transcript Stabilization and Localization","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/beach-domain-protein-spirrig-essential-arabidopsis-salt-stress-tolerance-functions-regulator-transcr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7599664,"mean":6.5471410587506,"rank":1158261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6438722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7599664,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226754,"mean":8.015439434098,"rank":44193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":182378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226754,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3141,"mean":36.149997452229,"rank":1824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3141,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":93.126586666667,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
