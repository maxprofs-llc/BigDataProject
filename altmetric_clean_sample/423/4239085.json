Although endothelial dysfunction and aortic stiffness have been documented, little is known about the effects of T2DM on coronary microvascular structural remodeling. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays an important role in large artery stiffness and mesenteric vessel remodeling in hypertension and T2DM. The goal of this study was to determine whether the blockade of AT1R signaling dictates vascular smooth muscle growth that partially underlies coronary arteriole remodeling in T2DM. Control and db\/db mice were given AT1R blocker losartan via drinking water for 4weeks. Using pressure myography, we found that coronary arterioles from 16-week db\/db mice undergo inward hypertrophic remodeling due to increased wall thickness and wall-to-lumen ratio with a decreased lumen diameter. This remodeling was accompanied by decreased elastic modulus (decreased stiffness). Losartan treatment decreased wall thickness, wall-to-lumen ratio, and coronary arteriole cell number in db\/db mice. Losartan treatment did not affect incremental elastic modulus. However, losartan improved coronary flow reserve. Our data suggest that Ang II-AT1R signaling mediates, at least in part, coronary arteriole inward hypertrophic remodeling in T2DM without affecting vascular mechanics, further suggesting that targeting the coronary microvasculature in T2DM may help reduce cardiac ischemic events.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f0","authors":["Husarek, Kathryn E","Katz, Paige S","Trask, Aaron J","Galantowicz, Maarten L","Cismowski, Mary J","Lucchesi, Pamela A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vph.2015.06.013","first_seen_on":"2015-07-03T10:08:38+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1879-3649"],"journal":"Vascular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1435918058,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26133668?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26133668","pubdate":"2015-07-03T22:05:43+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"The angiotensin receptor blocker losartan reduces coronary arteriole remodeling in type 2 diabetic mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/angiotensin-receptor-blocker-losartan-reduces-coronary-arteriole-remodeling-type-2-diabetic-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5309415,"mean":6.2289529198506,"rank":4420714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5309415,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187647,"mean":8.4035692527419,"rank":151235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187647,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":3.5161879194631,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.65714285714286,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
