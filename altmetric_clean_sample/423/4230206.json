The incorporation of these agents has revolutionized the treatment of CRPC but has also raised the question of what is the ideal sequence of administering them. Enzalutamide is a nonsteroidal second-generation antiandrogen that has been approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC both in the post-docetaxel and chemotherapy-na\u00efve settings. This article reviews the pharmacological characteristics of enzalutamide, the efficacy studies which led to its approval, its safety profile, and quality of life-related parameters as well as its place in the sequential treatment and management of metastatic prostate cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbff","authors":["Alejo Rodriguez-Vida","Sarah Rudman","Cora Sternberg","Myria Galazi","Simon Chowdhury","Rodriguez-Vida, Alejo","Galazi, Myria","Rudman, Sarah","Chowdhury, Simon","Sternberg, Cora N"],"doi":"10.2147\/dddt.s69433","first_seen_on":"2015-07-01T03:08:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-8881"],"journal":"Drug Design, Development and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1459438087,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=22387","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2147\/DDDT.S69433","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26170619"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=25708","pmid":"26170619","pubdate":"2015-07-15T22:01:45+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enzalutamide-treatment-metastatic-castrationresistant-prostate-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7471181,"mean":6.4836306053357,"rank":1665555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5772975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7471181,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226081,"mean":7.9922744692146,"rank":61162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":163878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226081,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":964,"mean":3.146701973001,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":964,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":1.6169367088608,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
