Resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid were done molecularly using line probe assay. TB patients infected with MDR-M.tuberculosis and non MDR-M.tuberculosis strain were considered as cases and controls, respectively. Data was collected using structured questionnaire with face to face interview. Patients' clinical record review was also done.Multivariate analysis was computed to determine the risk factors of MDR-TB.\nA total of 153 MDR-TB and equal number of non MDR-TB patients' participated in the study. Patients who had TB treatment failure (AOR=13.5,CI=2.69-70), cavitations on chest x-ray (AOR=1.9,CI=1.1-3.38) and contact with MDR-TB patients (AOR=1.4,CI=0.19-0.39) were more likely to be MDR-TB patients. Low monthly income (AOR=1.1,CI=0.34-0.47),alcohol consumption (AOR=1.5,CI=0.2-0.98) and young age (AOR=2.9,CI=1.07-7.68) were the other risk factors of MDR-TB.\nTB treatment failure, cavitation on chest X-ray, contact with MDR-TB patients and low socioeconomic status were important risk factors for development of MDR-TB. Therefore, strict adherence to directly observed therapy, appropriate management of TB patients and advice on the value of nutrients are helpful to control the spreading of MDR-TB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f6100068f5","authors":["Mulu, Wondemagegn","Mekonnen, Daniel","Yimer, Mulat","Admassu, Aschalew","Abera, Bayeh","Wondemagegn Mulu","Daniel Mekonnen","Mulat Yimer","Aschalew Admassu","Bayeh Abera"],"doi":"10.4314\/ahs.v15i2.9","first_seen_on":"2015-07-01T16:07:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1729-0503","1680-6905"],"issue":"2","journal":"African Health Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1491038200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26124781?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4480497\/"],"pmid":"26124781","pubdate":"2015-07-01T22:05:23+00:00","publisher":"Makerere University Medical School","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"368","subjects":["medicine","healthservices"],"title":"Risk factors for multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients in Amhara National Regional State.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis-patients-amhara-national-regional-state-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":6408589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1148315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231190,"mean":8.3024869781868,"rank":160288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":38618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231190,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":324,"mean":2.4023405572755,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":324,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.98,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
