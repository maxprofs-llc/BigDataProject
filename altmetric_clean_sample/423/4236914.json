This is the first study reporting the use of bisphosphonates in patients with Bruck syndrome (BS).\nOI and BS are genetic disorders that result in bone fragility and reduced BMD. There is little literature describing the efficacy and safety of ZA in this population. In this study, we assess the response to treatment with ZA at six monthly intervals in Egyptian children with OI and BS for a period of 2\u00a0years.\nThirty-three patients with OI and five patients with BS were treated with 0.1\u00a0mg\/kg ZA intravenously every 6\u00a0months for 2\u00a0years during which they were followed up using different parameters. A clinical severity score (CSS) was applied to the patients before and 2\u00a0years after the start of therapy. Comparison of disease severity and response to ZA treatment between autosomal-dominant (AD) and autosomal-recessive (AR) OI patients was also done.\nAfter 6\u00a0months of treatment, OI and BS patients showed a significant increase in BMD Z-scores (P\u2009<\u20090.003 in the spine and P\u2009<\u20090.004 in the hip), together with a significant drop in fracture rate (P\u2009<\u20090.001), relief of pain (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and improvement in ambulation (P\u2009<\u20090.001). CSS was significantly reduced after 2\u00a0years of treatment in both OI and BS patients. AR-OI patients were more severely affected than AD-OI patients and showed more significant improvement.\nZoledronic acid proved to be safe and effective in the treatment of OI and BS. The biannual infusion protocol was convenient to patients. There was a positive correlation between disease severity and benefits of the treatment. The use of the CSS proved to be of value in the assessment of the degree of severity in OI, and with some modifications, it was a valuable tool for the assessment of response to treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000326e","authors":["G.
