We investigated changes in targeted genes and proteins with roles in autophagy following 5 days of energy balance (EB), energy deficit (ED) and resistance exercise (REX) after ED. Muscle biopsies from 15 subjects (8 males, 7 females) were taken at rest following 5 days of EB [45 kcal\u2219kg fat free mass (FFM)(-1)\u2219day(-1)] and 5 days of ED (30 kcal\u2219kg FFM(-1)\u2219day(-1)). After ED, subjects completed a bout of REX and consumed either placebo (PLA) or 30 g whey protein (PRO) immediately post-exercise. Muscle biopsies were obtained at 1 and 4 h into recovery in each trial. Resting protein levels of autophagy-related gene protein 5 (Atg5) decreased after ED compared to EB (~23%, P<0.001) and remained below EB from 1-4 h post-exercise in PLA (~17%) and at 1 h in PRO (~18%, P<0.05). In addition, conjugated Atg5 (cAtg12) decreased below EB in PLA at 4 h (~20, P<0.05); however its values were increased above this time point in PRO at 4 h alongside increases in FOXO1 above EB (~22-26%, P<0.05). Notably, these changes were subsequent to increases in unc-51 like kinase 1Ser757 phosphorylation (~60%) 1 h post-exercise in PRO. No significant changes in gene expression of selected autophagy markers were found, but EGR-1 increased above ED and EB in PLA (~417-864%) and PRO (~1417-2731%) trials 1 h post-exercise (P<0.001). Post-exercise protein availability, compared to placebo, can selectively promote autophagic responses to REX in ED.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002212","authors":["Smiles, William John","Areta, Jos\u00e9 L","Coffey, Vernon G","Phillips, Stuart M","Moore, Daniel Ryan","Stellingwerff, Trent","Burke, Louise M","Hawley, John Alan","Camera, Donny Michael","William J.
