Between December 2013 and August 2014, all cancer patients who received PN (including total PN and Kabiven) in a regional hospital of Southern Taiwan were included in this retrospective study. A total of 107 cancer patients received PN. Among them, colorectal cancer was the most common type of cancer (n = 45, 42.1%), followed by gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, and esophageal cancer. After evaluation of the appropriateness of PN administration, 88 (82.2%) PN episodes were considered appropriate and unavoidable, 4 (3.7%) as appropriate and avoidable but 15 (14.1%) as inappropriate. In conclusion, PN could be inappropriately used by some oncologic physicians. Physicians and nutrition support team specialists should carefully evaluate the indication of PN administration for cancer patients to obey the generally acknowledged usage rule.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000149f","authors":["Feng, Yu-Lin","Lee, Chun-Sung","Chiu, Chong-Chi","Chao, Chien-Ming","Lai, Chih-Cheng"],"doi":"10.1080\/01635581.2015.1053501","first_seen_on":"2015-07-03T10:14:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-7914"],"journal":"Nutrition and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1435918445,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26134214?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26134214","pubdate":"2015-07-03T22:04:53+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Appropriateness of Parenteral Nutrition Usage in Cancer Patients.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/appropriateness-parenteral-nutrition-usage-cancer-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5310151,"mean":6.2304813246328,"rank":4421387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5310151,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187657,"mean":8.4037067826238,"rank":151241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187657,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":678,"mean":6.2671698670606,"rank":547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":678,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.7607692307692,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
