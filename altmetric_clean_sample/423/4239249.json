Phytoene formation mediated by phytoene synthase (PSY) is rate-limiting in the biosynthesis of carotenoids while carotenoid catabolism involves a multitude of non-enzymatic and enzymatic processes. We investigated carotenoid and apocarotenoid formation in Arabidopsis in response to enhanced pathway flux upon PSY overexpression. This resulted in a dramatic accumulation of mainly b-carotene in roots and non-green calli while carotenoids remained unchanged in leaves. We show that in chloroplasts, surplus PSY was partially soluble, localized in the stroma and therefore inactive while the membrane-bound portion mediated a doubling of phytoene synthesis rates. Increased pathway flux was not compensated by enhanced generation of long-chain apocarotenals, but resulted in higher levels of C13-apocarotenoid glycosides (AGs). Using mutant lines deficient in carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCD) we identified CCD4 as being mainly responsible for the majority of AGs formed. Moreover, changed AG patterns in the carotene hydroxylase mutants lut1 and lut5 exhibiting altered leaf carotenoids allowed to define specific xanthophyll species as precursors for the apocarotenoid aglycons detected. In contrast to leaves, carotenoid hyperaccumulating roots contained higher levels of b-carotene derived apocarotenals while AGs were absent. These contrasting responses are associated with tissue-specific capacities to synthesize xanthophylls which thus determine the modes of carotenoid accumulation and apocarotenoid formation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["L\u00e4tari, Kira","W\u00fcst, Florian","H\u00fcbner, Michaela","Schaub, Patrick","Beisel, Kim Gabriele","Matsubara, Shizue","Beyer, Peter","Welsch, Ralf","Kira L\u00e4tari","Florian W\u00fcst","Michaela H\u00fcbner","Patrick Schaub","Kim Gabriele Beisel","Shizue Matsubara","Peter Beyer","Ralf Welsch"],"doi":"10.1104\/pp.15.00243","first_seen_on":"2015-07-03T10:19:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2548","0032-0889"],"journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1463050959,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26134165?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1104\/pp.15.00243"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.plantphysiol.org\/content\/plantphysiol\/168\/4\/1550.full.pdf","pmid":"26134165","pubdate":"2015-07-03T22:04:57+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Tissue-specific Apocarotenoid Glycosylation Contributes to Carotenoid Homeostasis in Arabidopsis Leaves.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tissuespecific-apocarotenoid-glycosylation-contributes-carotenoid-homeostasis-arabidopsis-leaves"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7690302,"mean":6.5973724521265,"rank":6653303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7690302,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227276,"mean":8.0420751600485,"rank":189450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227276,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3696,"mean":3.8713282814614,"rank":3349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3696,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":3.103,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
