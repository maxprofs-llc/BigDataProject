Different pre-treatment clinical, biological and pathological biomarkers, including SBR grade, the Ki-67 proliferation index, androgen receptor expression, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cytokeratin 5\/6 staining, were assessed. Tumor glucose metabolism at baseline and its change after the first cycle of NAC (\u0394SUVmax) were assessed using FDG-PET.\nThe pCR rate was 42%. High Ki-67 proliferation index (p=0.016), negative EGFR status (p=0.042), and high \u0394SUVmax (p=0.002) were significantly associated with pCR. In multivariate logistic regression, both negative EGFR status (Odds ratio=6.4; p=0.043) and high \u0394SUVmax (Odds ratio=7.1; p=0.014) were independent predictors of pCR. Using a threshold at -50%, tumor \u0394SUVmax predicted pCR with a negative, a positive predictive value and an accuracy of 79%, 70% and 75%, respectively. Combining a low \u0394SUVmax and positive EGFR status could predict non-pCR with an accuracy of 92%.\nIt is important to define the chemosensitivity of TNBC to NAC early. Combining EGFR status and the metabolic response assessed with FDG-PET can help the physician to early predict the probability of achieving pCR or not. Given these results, the interest of response-guided tailoring of the chemotherapy might be tested in multicenter trials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Olivier Humbert","Jean-Marc Riedinger","Celine Charon-Barra","Alina Berriolo-Riedinger","Isabelle Desmoulins","Veronique Lorgis","Salim Kanoun","Charles Coutant","Pierre Fumoleau","Alexandre Cochet","Francois Brunotte","Humbert, Olivier","Riedinger, Jean-Marc","Charon-Barra, Celine","Berriolo-Riedinger, Alina","Desmoulins, Isabelle","Lorgis, Veronique","Kanoun, Salim","Coutant, Charles","Fumoleau, Pierre","Cochet, Alexandre","Brunotte, Francois"],"doi":"10.1158\/1078-0432.ccr-15-0384","endpage":"5468","first_seen_on":"2015-07-01T14:12:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-3265","1078-0432"],"issue":"24","journal":"Clinical Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1474087327,"links":["http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/30\/1078-0432.CCR-15-0384.abstract?papetoc=","http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/21\/24\/5460.short?rss=1","http:\/\/m.clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/21\/24\/5460.abstract?etoc","http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/21\/24\/5460","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26130460?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/30\/1078-0432.CCR-15-0384.full.pdf","pmid":"26130460","pubdate":"2015-07-02T10:48:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"5460","title":"Identification of Biomarkers Including 18FDG-PET\/CT for Early Prediction of Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-biomarkers-including-18fdgpetct-early-prediction-response-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-tr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":3984695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4221312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231085,"mean":8.2895466237387,"rank":102333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":120319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231085,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5464,"mean":6.3069946915614,"rank":3169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":2063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5464,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177,"mean":5.8443068181818,"rank":120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerCureNow\/status\/616247959160664064","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4232203],"posted_on":"2015-07-01T14:12:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Cure Cancer Now","url":"http:\/\/cancercure-d.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1128872809\/Hep_G2_Lab_test_normal.jpg","description":"Pure science is what it is taking to defeat cancer.
