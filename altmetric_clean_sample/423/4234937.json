PP2A is comprised of a heterodimeric core enzyme and a substrate-specific regulatory subunit. Potentially, at least seventy different compositions of PP2A exist because of variable regulatory subunit binding that accounts for various activity modulating numerous cell functions. Due to the constitutive phosphatase activity present inside cells, a sensitive assay is required to detect the changes of PP2A activity under various experimental conditions. We optimized a fluorescence assay (DIFMU assay) by combining it with prior anti-PP2A immunoprecipitation to quantify PP2A-specific phosphatase activity. It is also known that prior exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induces \"immune tolerance\" of the cells to subsequent stimulation. Herein we report that PP2A activity is upregulated in tolerized peritoneal macrophages, corresponding to decreased TNF-\u03b1 secretion upon second LPS stimulation. We further examined the role of PP2A in the tolerance effect by using PP2AC\u03b1l\u00b0xl\u00b0x;lyM-Cre conditional knockout macrophages. We found that PP2A phosphatase activity cannot be further increased by tolerance. TNF-\u03b1 secretion from tolerized PP2AC\u03b1l\u00b0xl\u00b0x;lyM-Cre macrophages is higher than tolerized control macrophages. Furthermore, we showed that the increased TNF-\u03b1 secretion may be due to an epigenetic transcriptionally active signature on the promoter of TNF-\u03b1 gene rather than regulation of the NF\u03baB\/I\u03baB signaling pathway. These results suggest a role for increased PP2A activity in the regulation of immune tolerance.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef742a83ee09648b51a3","authors":["Sun, Lei","Ii, Adlai L Pappy","Pham, Tiffany T","Shanley, Thomas P"],"doi":"10.3390\/biom5031284","first_seen_on":"2015-07-02T11:01:57+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["2218-273X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biomolecules","last_mentioned_on":1435834746,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26131975?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26131975","pubdate":"2015-07-02T22:03:49+00:00","title":"Study of Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) Activity in LPS-Induced Tolerance Using Fluorescence-Based and Immunoprecipitation-Aided Methodology.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-protein-phosphatase-2a-pp2a-activity-lpsinduced-tolerance-using-fluorescencebased-immunoprecip"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5307679,"mean":6.2286667740583,"rank":3736696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":888137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5307679,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187720,"mean":8.3923575450542,"rank":130771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187720,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":4.8507785234899,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.975,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
