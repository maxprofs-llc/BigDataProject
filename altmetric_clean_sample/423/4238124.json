Primary endpoints were nature, incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs). Secondary endpoints were effect on peripheral blood B cells, biomarkers and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates.\nEighteen patients were randomised to atacicept and nine to placebo. AEs occurred in 17 (94.4%) atacicept- and nine (100%) placebo-treated patients. Serious AEs (SAEs) occurred in six (33.3%) atacicept- and two (22.2%) placebo-treated patients. There were no infection-related SAEs. Hypersensitivity and injection site reactions were more common, and more patients withdrew due to AEs, in the atacicept group. Median reductions in immunoglobulins (Ig) were greater with atacicept (IgG -31.2%, IgM -60.9% and IgA -56.4%) than with placebo (IgG -4.4%, IgM -15.9%, IgA -8.2%). Peripheral B-cell numbers in all patients remained low after rituximab-mediated depletion, limiting comparison of time to recovery between treatment groups. There were no between-group differences in ACR-20\/50\/70 response rates.\nIn this exploratory trial, atacicept in combination with rituximab showed no new safety issues. Peripheral B-cell counts remained too low to determine if atacicept delayed B-cell re-expansion following rituximab-mediated depletion. Despite clear biological effects, adding atacicept to rituximab in patients with active RA was not associated with clinical benefit. This article is protected by copyright.
