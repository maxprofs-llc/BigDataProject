All 12 patients were human immunodeficiency virus-positive, and underwent the standard highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Skin lesions mainly presented as purple, or rufous papules, or plaques; skin biopsy showed diffuse or flaky infiltration of spindle cells, active proliferation of slit-like vasculature, erythrocyte exudation, hemosiderin deposition, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the expression of Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (+), and CD31 (+) in T-cells; factor VIII (+) and HHF-35 (+) in the proliferating vascular endothelial cells; vimentin (+) and S-100 protein (-) in the vessel wall; and CD34 (+++) in the spindle cells of 6 cases, with 1 case of negative CD34 expression. Four patients with confined lesions underwent surgery and microwave therapy, and received a favorable prognosis. Two patients with limited lesions underwent microwave therapy, and the lesions subsided. Of six patients with widely distributed sarcomas, five underwent microwave therapy and one received combined chemotherapy; five attained significant efficacy, and one died. There were no significant differences in the clinicopathological features and immunological phenotypes between the Chinese Han patients and those from other populations. Along with basal HAART, patients in early stages, with sarcomas <2 cm in diameter should undergo surgery and microwave therapy, while patients with sarcomas >2 cm in diameter should undergo chemotherapy and microwave therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007523","authors":["Zheng, X-K","Lu, S-H","Liu, J-F","Lai, Y-R"],"doi":"10.4238\/2015.june.18.25","first_seen_on":"2015-07-01T10:19:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1676-5680","16765680"],"issue":"2","journal":"Genetics and Molecular Research","last_mentioned_on":1459006857,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26125890?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26125890?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26125890","pubdate":"2015-07-01T22:01:56+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Clinical and pathological features and treatment of AIDS-related cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma in Chinese Han patients.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-pathological-features-treatment-aidsrelated-cutaneous-kaposis-sarcoma-chinese-han-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7441664,"mean":6.4677569293272,"rank":3198781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4158537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7441664,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225736,"mean":7.9934548474983,"rank":90463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":132570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225736,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1429,"mean":0.85767086834734,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1429,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":1.1352564102564,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"PE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/status\/616189288259059712","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4231194],"posted_on":"2015-07-01T10:19:09+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":58},"tweet_id":"616189288259059712"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/statuses\/713667352110301184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4231194],"posted_on":"2016-03-26T10:02:10+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":58},"tweet_id":"713667352110301184"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sarconcology\/statuses\/713752608528343040","license":"gnip","rt":["dermatologyf"],"citation_ids":[4231194],"posted_on":"2016-03-26T15:40:57+00:00","author":{"name":"My name is Sarcoma","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/786327294503686145\/Hmh7nbtS_normal.jpg","description":"My name is sarcoma.
