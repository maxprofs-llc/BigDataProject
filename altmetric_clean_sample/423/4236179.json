Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surface of teeth. The cavities were restored with Biodentine in the presence (control group) or absence (experimental group) of a Dycal protective base. The pulpal tissue responses were histologically and histomorphometrically assessed at postoperative periods of 3 and 8\u00a0weeks. Three specimens were further evaluated with scanning electron microscopy. The maximum thickness of the postoperatively formed mineralized matrix beneath the cavity floor was measured. Data were statistically analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney U tests.\nA bacterial staining reaction along the cavity walls or intense inflammatory infiltration in the pulp was not detected in any of the specimens. A continuous zone of the postoperatively formed mineralized matrix mostly of atubular structure with scattered defects and cellular inclusions and occasionally followed by a thin zone with tubular morphology was detected in all specimens of the control group and 13 of 18 experimental group teeth. In the remaining teeth of the experimental group, a separate zone composed of the osteotypic mineralized matrix and soft tissues was noted between the circumpulpal and the newly formed matrix. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the fibrous structural morphology of the tertiary dentin. A significantly higher rate of the postoperatively formed mineralized matrix had been formed in the teeth of the experimental group in both periods of 3 and 8\u00a0weeks (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01).\nThe present investigation indicates that under the present experimental conditions tertiary dentin with occasional intermediate formation of osteodentin is observed after the application of Biodentine in the presence or absence of a Dycal protective base. The\u00a0thickness of the tertiary dentine zone was significantly higher in the absence of Dycal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f6a","authors":["Tziafa, Christina","Koliniotou-Koumpia, Eugenia","Papadimitriou, Seraphim","Tziafas, Dimitrios"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.joen.2015.03.018","first_seen_on":"2015-07-02T16:56:58+00:00","issns":["1878-3554","0099-2399"],"journal":"Journal of Endodontics","last_mentioned_on":1435856153,"links":["http:\/\/www.jendodon.com\/article\/S0099-2399%2815%2900299-X\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&amp%3Belsca2=email&amp%3Belsca3=0099-2399_201507_41_7_&amp%3Belsca4=Dentistry"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jendodon.com\/article\/S009923991500299X\/pdf","pmid":"25956607","pubdate":"2015-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Dentinogenic Activity of Biodentine in Deep Cavities of\u00a0Miniature Swine Teeth","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dentinogenic-activity-biodentine-deep-cavities-miniature-swine-teeth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5307787,"mean":6.2289258319763,"rank":3736843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":888170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5307787,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187725,"mean":8.3924227376363,"rank":130765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187725,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":753,"mean":1.3882234042553,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":753,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.2892857142857,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":5,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":2,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":15,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1},"mendeley":{"BE":1,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/endogarrido\/status\/616651520180813824","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4236179],"posted_on":"2015-07-02T16:55:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Roman Martinez","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/788792419995136000\/fGy_0UoD_normal.jpg","description":"Cirujano Dentista Especialista en Endodoncia.","id_on_source":"endogarrido","tweeter_id":"104023421","geo":{"lt":17.98689,"ln":-92.93028,"country":"MX"},"followers":1125},"tweet_id":"616651520180813824"}]}}
