Eighteen brain MRIs were reviewed and evaluated with a new rating scale based on scoring for abnormal hyperintense lesions and atrophy.\nAt the last follow-up MRI, all patients had hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images of the frontal white matter, anterior temporal lobe, external capsules, and thalami. Patients with longer time from the onset of cognitive impairment had higher MRI severity score. The atrophy advanced, followed by white matter lesion progression. During the early stage, hyperintense lesions were observed in the frontal white matter, external capsule, and pons. During the late stage, the arc-shaped hyperintense lesion from the pons to the middle cerebellar peduncles, which we designated the \"arc sign,\" became evident. The arc sign was a characteristic finding for CARASIL in the advanced stage.\nThese characteristic MRI findings for CARASIL are useful for selecting patients for genetic testing. The rating scale correlates well with disease duration and might be useful for assessing disease progression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Hiroaki Nozaki","Yumi Sekine","Toshio Fukutake","Yoshinori Nishimoto","Yutaka Shimoe","Akiko Shirata","Sohei Yanagawa","Mikio Hirayama","Masato Tamura","Masatoyo Nishizawa","Osamu Onodera"],"doi":"10.1212\/wnl.0000000000001803","first_seen_on":"2015-07-03T04:12:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-632X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1457600879,"links":["http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/02\/WNL.0000000000001803.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/02\/WNL.0000000000001803.short","http:\/\/neurology.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.1212\/WNL.0000000000001803","http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/85\/5\/459.abstract","http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/02\/WNL.0000000000001803.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/02\/WNL.0000000000001803.full.pdf","pmid":"26138950","pubdate":"2015-07-04T22:02:53+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Characteristic features and progression of abnormalities on MRI for CARASIL","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characteristic-features-progression-abnormalities-mri-carasil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":1576816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6879392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231168,"mean":8.2992407307272,"rank":50127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":180772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231168,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10014,"mean":13.985416158993,"rank":3361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":6642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10014,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216,"mean":16.405851162791,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
