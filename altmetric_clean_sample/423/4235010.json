CXCR2 expression levels in 46 cancerous tissues, 20 colonic benign tumour tissues, and 30 normal colonic mucosa tissues were examined at both the mRNA level and protein level by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and two-step immunohistochemical staining, respectively. We found that the positive rate of CXCR2 protein expression in cancer tissue samples was 69.6%. RT-PCR results confirmed that CXCR2 expression was significantly higher in tumour tissues compared with benign tumour and normal mucosa tissues (P < 0.05). When 46 colorectal cancer patients were divided into groups according to the clinical stage, lymph node metastasis and liver metastasis, we found that CXCR2 expression increased in patients with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05), and its expression was much higher in stage III and IV cancers than stage I and II cancers. These findings suggest that CXCR2 expression in CRC patients may be a potential molecular biomarker for evaluation of tumour growth and invasion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc2a","authors":["Wu, Wenjuan","Sun, Changjiang","Xu, Daoliang","Zhang, Xizhi","Shen, Weigan","Lv, Ye","Ma, Tao"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-02T11:25:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-5901"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1435836306,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26131180?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26131180","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Expression of CXCR2 and its clinical significance in human colorectal cancer.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-cxcr2-clinical-significance-human-colorectal-cancer-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5307571,"mean":6.2278488272417,"rank":4419458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5307571,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187718,"mean":8.3924222206834,"rank":151241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187718,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":940,"mean":1.2832438764643,"rank":471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":940,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.36,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/616568276001263616","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4235010],"posted_on":"2015-07-02T11:25:06+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
