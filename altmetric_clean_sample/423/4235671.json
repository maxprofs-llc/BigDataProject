Wild-type (WT) mice and mice with intestinal epithelium (IE)-specific deletion of the P450 reductase gene (IE-Cpr-null) were compared. IE-Cpr-null mice have little microsomal P450 activity in IE cells. DSS treatment (2.5% in drinking water for 6 days) caused more severe colon inflammation, as evidenced by the presence of higher levels of myeloperoxidase and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2), and greater weight loss, colonic tissue damage, and colon shortening, in IE-Cpr-null mice than in WT mice. The IE-Cpr-null mice were deficient in colonic corticosterone (CC) synthesis, as indicated by the inability of ex-vivo cultured colonic tissues from DSS-treated IE-Cpr-null mice (in contrast to DSS-treated WT mice) to show increased CC production, compared to vehicle-treated mice, and by the ability of added deoxycorticosterone (DOC), a precursor of CC biosynthesis via mitochondrial CYP11B1, to restore ex-vivo CC production by colonic tissues from DSS-treated null mice. Intriguingly, null (but not WT) mice failed to show increased serum CC levels following DSS treatment. Nevertheless, co-treatment of DSS-exposed mice with DOC, which did not restore DSS-induced increase in serum CC, abolished the hypersensitivity of IE-Cpr-null mice to DSS-induced colon injury. Taken together, our results strongly support the notion that microsomal P450 enzymes in the intestine play an important role in protecting colon epithelium from DSS-induced inflammation and injury, possibly through increased local CC synthesis in response to DSS challenge.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de2","authors":["Yi Zhu","Fang Xie","Liang Ding","Xiaoyu Fan","Xinxin Ding","Qing-Yu Zhang"],"doi":"10.1124\/jpet.115.223263","first_seen_on":"2015-07-02T14:52:08+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1521-0103","1521-0103 (Online)"],"journal":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1436285064,"links":["http:\/\/jpet.aspetjournals.org\/content\/354\/1\/10"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jpet.aspetjournals.org\/content\/354\/1\/10.full.pdf","pmid":"25926522","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Intestinal Epithelium\u2013Specific Knockout of the Cytochrome P450 Reductase Gene Exacerbates Dextran Sulfate Sodium\u2013Induced Colitis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intestinal-epitheliumspecific-knockout-cytochrome-p450-reductase-gene-exacerbates-dextran-sulfate-so"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325534,"mean":6.2412730147394,"rank":3528127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1576222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325534,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187924,"mean":8.393107293945,"rank":121981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":57017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187924,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1848,"mean":3.5219317812669,"rank":1372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1848,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":3.1943243243243,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"TH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JPET_Journal\/status\/616619931992522752","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4235671],"posted_on":"2015-07-02T14:50:22+00:00","author":{"name":"JPET (ASPET)","url":"http:\/\/jpet.aspetjournals.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2971675651\/f4e9c2e9c6ec17e04e07d0589c022c3e_normal.png","description":"'The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics' provides broad coverage of all aspects of the interactions of chemicals with biological systems.","id_on_source":"JPET_Journal","tweeter_id":"1009457934","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":110},"tweet_id":"616619931992522752"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1006579779366619&id=504418759582726","license":"public","citation_ids":[4235671],"posted_on":"2015-07-07T16:04:24+00:00","summary":"Intestinal epithelium-specific knockout of P450 exacerbates colitis\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/1GR0AC0","author":{"name":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics \/ JPET (ASPET)","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/504418759582726","facebook_wall_name":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics \/ JPET (ASPET)","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/504418759582726\/picture","id_on_source":"504418759582726"}}]}}
