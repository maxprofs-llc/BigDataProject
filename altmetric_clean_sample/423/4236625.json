Nematodes were isolated from an agricultural area under different management of long-term crop rotation experiment from Argentina during three seasons. After DNA extraction, Polymerase Chain Reaction-amplifications were performed and considered as indicators of successful DNA extraction. The CTAB combined with proteinase K and phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol was the unique successful method because positive amplifications were obtained by using both eukaryotic and nematode specific primers. This work could contribute to biodiversity studies of nematodes on agroecosystems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069a2","authors":["Mondino, Eduardo A","Covacevich, Fernanda","Studdert, Guillermo A","Pimentel, Jo\u00e3o P","Berbara, Ricardo L L"],"doi":"10.1590\/0001-3765201520130110","first_seen_on":"2015-07-02T17:42:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1678-2690"],"issue":"2","journal":"Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias","last_mentioned_on":1435831958,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26131632?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26131632","pubdate":"2015-07-02T22:04:35+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Extracting DNA of nematodes communities from Argentine Pampas agricultural soils.","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extracting-dna-nematodes-communities-argentine-pampas-agricultural-soils"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5307915,"mean":6.2288636865635,"rank":2818145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1801683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5307915,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187726,"mean":8.3921190038621,"rank":103303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":66011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187726,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":0.84604938271605,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.50909090909091,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
