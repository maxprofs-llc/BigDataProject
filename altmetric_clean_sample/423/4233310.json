Several factors alter internal potassium balance independently of changes in external balance. Acid-base disturbances produce shifts of potassium into or out of cells, but attempts to quantify these effects are not likely to be clinically useful. Hypertonicity produces a shift of potassium out of cells. Several hormones (insulin, aldosterone, catecholamines, glucagon, and growth hormone) may have roles in internal potassium balance. Digitalis and succinylcholine, by producing efflux of potassium from cells, may cause hyperkalemia. Potassium is released from skeletal muscle during exercise, causing an increase in the plasma potassium concentration. The periodic paralyses are associated with well-defined transient alterations in internal potassium balance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Sterns, R H","Cox, M","Feig, P U","Singer, I"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-01T21:10:37+00:00","issns":["0025-7974"],"issue":"5","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1435784977,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6268928"],"pmid":"6268928","pubdate":"1981-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Internal potassium balance and the control of the plasma potassium concentration.","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/internal-potassium-balance-control-plasma-potassium-concentration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5302794,"mean":6.2252537585405,"rank":3733410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":886923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5302794,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187442,"mean":8.4075559029242,"rank":130609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187442,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2660,"mean":2.2464836404663,"rank":1439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2660,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252,"mean":1.647203187251,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
