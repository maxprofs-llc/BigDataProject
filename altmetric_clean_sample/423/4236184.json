Contours of several patients were deformably mapped to phantoms where the test bolus contours were designed. Treatment plans were created on the phantoms following our institutional planning guideline. The DICOM file of the bolus contours were then converted to stereoLithography (stl) file for the 3d printer. The boluses were printed on a commercial 3D printer using polylactic acid (PLA) material. Custom printing parameters were optimized in order to meet the requirement of bolus composition. The workflow was tested on multiple anatomical sites such as skull, nose and chest wall. The size of boluses varies from 6\u00d79cm2 to 12\u00d725cm2. To commission the process, basic CT and dose properties of the printing materials were measured in photon and electron beams and compared against water and soft superflab bolus. Phantoms were then scanned to confirm the placement of custom boluses. Finally dose distributions with rescanned CTs were compared with those computer-generated boluses.\nThe relative electron density(1.08\u00b10.006) of the printed boluses resemble those of liquid tap water(1.04\u00b10.004). The dosimetric properties resemble those of liquid tap water(1.04\u00b10.004). The dosimetric properties were measured at dmax with an ion chamber in electron and photon open beams. Compared with solid water and soft bolus, the output difference was within 1% for the 3D printer material. The printed boluses fit well to the phantom surfaces on CT scans. The dose distribution and DVH based on the printed boluses match well with those based on TPS generated boluses.\n3d printing provides a cost effective and convenient solution for patient-specific boluses in radiation therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000309b","authors":["Zhao, B","Yang, M","Yan, Y","Rahimi, A","Chopra, R","Jiang, S"],"doi":"10.1118\/1.4923784","first_seen_on":"2015-07-02T16:57:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0094-2405"],"issue":"6","journal":"Medical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1435843826,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26127085"],"pmid":"26127085","pubdate":"2015-07-02T22:13:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"SU-C-213-03: Custom 3D Printed Boluses for Radiation Therapy.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suc21303-custom-3d-printed-boluses-radiation-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5307787,"mean":6.2289258319763,"rank":4419647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5307787,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187724,"mean":8.3924693085026,"rank":151247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187724,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2296,"mean":1.6279921568627,"rank":1756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2296,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":653,"mean":1.0006901840491,"rank":402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":653,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NIHL3D\/status\/616599815443587072","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4236184],"posted_on":"2015-07-02T13:30:26+00:00","author":{"name":"NIHL 3D Printing","url":"http:\/\/nihlibrary.nih.gov","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/535844758770311168\/TEZkAxsL_normal.png","description":"National Institutes of Health Library","id_on_source":"NIHL3D","tweeter_id":"2887052859","geo":{"lt":38.98067,"ln":-77.10026,"country":"US"},"followers":735},"tweet_id":"616599815443587072"}]}}
