The pretreatment plasma microRNA-122 level was assessed using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, and the correlation between microRNA-122 expression and various clinical parameters was investigated.\nMultivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that, in all patients, a low platelet count (<100\u00d710(9)\/L), low albumin level (\u22643.5g\/dL.), and advanced tumor stage (modified Union for International Cancer Control stage III\/IV) were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival, while a low albumin level and advanced tumor stage were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). In a subgroup analysis of patients who underwent RFA, the patients with high miR-122 expression (>100) had significantly lower OS on Kaplan-Meier analysis (P=0.042). Furthermore, high microRNA-122 expression (hazard ratio [HR]=2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.12-6.35; P=0.026) and advanced tumor stage (HR=2.27; 95% CI=1.23-4.18; P=0.009) were independent risk factors for poor OS in patients treated with RFA. The combination of microRNA-122 and tumor stage resulted in an area under the curve of 0.818 for predicting 1-year OS in patients who underwent RFA.\nHigh plasma microRNA-122 expression was associated with poor OS in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent RFA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000377d","authors":["Cho, Hyo Jung","Kim, Jae Keun","Nam, Ji Sun","Wang, Hee Jung","Lee, Jei Hee","Kim, Bong Wan","Kim, Soon Sun","Noh, Choong Kyun","Shin, Sung Jae","Lee, Kee Myung","Cho, Sung Won","Cheong, Jae Youn"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clinbiochem.2015.06.019","first_seen_on":"2015-07-02T21:24:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2933"],"journal":"Clinical Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1435872273,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26129878?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26129878","pubdate":"2015-07-02T22:08:52+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"High Circulating MicroRNA-122 Expression is a Poor Prognostic Marker in Patients with Hepatitis B Virus-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma who undergo Radiofrequency Ablation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-circulating-microrna122-expression-poor-prognostic-marker-patients-hepatitis-b-virusrelated-hep-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5307787,"mean":6.2289258319763,"rank":4419646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5307787,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187724,"mean":8.3924780980489,"rank":151249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187724,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":561,"mean":2.4795571428571,"rank":361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":561,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.0045454545455,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
