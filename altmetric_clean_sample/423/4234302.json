We expressed each of these factors in the form of increasing risk and calculated population attributable risk percentage (PAR%) estimates for the six risk factors separately and jointly in the three groups.\nThe risk associations with these six well-accepted factors were comparable in the three groups. The significant racial\/ethnic differences in the prevalence of these factors and differences in their oophorectomy rates explained 31% of the lower incidence in African Americans compared to non-Hispanic Whites, but only 13% of the lower incidence in Hispanics. The PAR%s ranged from 27.5% to 31.0% for no tubal ligation, 15.9% to 22.2% for not using oral contraceptives, and 12.2% to 15.1% for using talc in the three groups.\nAll six risk factors are comparably important in the three groups. Differences in the prevalence of these factors and their oophorectomy rates explained approximately one-third of the difference in incidence between African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites.\nDevising strategies to lessen the burden of IEOC will be applicable to all three racial\/ethnic groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dcc","authors":["Anna H.
