Levomethorphan (LVM) and Dextromethorphan (DXM) act on the central nervous system and exhibit different pharmacological features. LVM, the l-stereoisomer of methorphan, shows many similarities to opiates such as heroin, morphine and codeine, including the potential for addiction, while the d-stereoisomer, DXM, does not have the same opioid effect. In the present study, NMR-based metabolomics were performed on the urine of rats treated with these stereoisomers, and showed significant differences in metabolic profiles. In urine within 24 h after treatment of these samples, levels of citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, creatine, and dimethylglycine were higher in LVM-treated rats than in DXM-treated rats. While urinary levels of hippurate and creatinine gradually increased over 72 h in DXM-treated rats, these metabolites were decreased in the urine by 48-72 h after treatment with LVM. The levels of these changed metabolites may provide the first evidence for different cellular responses to the metabolism of stereoisomers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d2e","authors":["\u798f\u539f \u6f54","\u5927\u91ce \u5f70\u5b50","\u82b1\u5c3b\uff08\u6728\u5009\uff09 \u7460\u7406"],"doi":"10.1248\/yakushi.17-00046","first_seen_on":"2017-09-05T04:28:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0031-6903","1347-5231"],"issue":"9","journal":"Yakugaku Zasshi = Journal of Pharmaceutical Society of Japan","last_mentioned_on":1504585667,"links":["https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/yakushi\/137\/9\/137_17-00046\/_pdf"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/yakushi\/137\/9\/137_17-00046\/_pdf","pmid":"28867701","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"\u516c\u76ca\u793e\u56e3\u6cd5\u4eba \u65e5\u672c\u85ac\u5b66\u4f1a","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacy","pharmacology"],"title":"A Metabolic Study on the Biochemical Effects of Chiral Illegal Drugs in Rats Using <sup>1<\/sup>H-NMR Spectroscopy","type":"article","volume":"137"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366342,"mean":7.0541652571821,"rank":7232147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366342,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117764,"mean":12.054937306285,"rank":95650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117764,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":578,"mean":1.8312062391681,"rank":458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":578,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/maskot1977\/statuses\/904923992678572033","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24783270],"posted_on":"2017-09-05T04:27:47+00:00","author":{"name":"\u30b7\u30e3\u30a2\u5c02\u7528\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\uff08\u9060\u9694\u64cd\u4f5c\u578b\uff09","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/893803436679897088\/SZhIJgKE_normal.jpg","description":"\u2665\u306f\u300c\u304a\u524d\u306b\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u3092\u304f\u308c\u3066\u3084\u308d\u3046 \u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u610f\u5473\u3067\u3042\u308a\u300c\u79c1\u306e\u30e9\u30d6\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u53d6\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u300d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u610f\u5473\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u307e\u305f\u79c1\u306e\u610f\u898b\u306f\u3001\u6240\u5c5e\u3059\u308b\u914d\u7ba1\u5de5\u4e8b\u4f1a\u793e\u304a\u3088\u3073\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u738b\u56fd\u306e\u6c11\u610f\u3092\u4ee3\u8868\u3057\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002","id_on_source":"maskot1977","tweeter_id":"72763982","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1777},"tweet_id":"904923992678572033"}]}}
