In this context, proteomics has emerged as a novel tool with potential for drug target discovery and to scrutinize the effects of antiplatelet drugs. Areas covered: The present review presents the main findings of platelet proteomic studies to date in the context of drug target discovery and perspectives for the future ahead. It includes data and evidences obtained from literature searches on PubMed as well as commentaries derived from the authors' experience and opinions. Expert commentary: Platelet proteomics applied to drug target discovery is a young field. Recent studies have shown promising data, especially in the context of coronary artery disease. However, challenges remain such as establishing definitive guidelines for blood collection and platelet isolation, essential to guarantee data reproducibility. Recent advances in quantitative platelet proteomics should lead to novel studies with higher clinical impact in the near future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d9","authors":["Irene Izquierdo"],"doi":"10.1080\/14789450.2016.1246188","endpage":"14","first_seen_on":"2016-10-22T00:22:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-8387","1478-9450"],"journal":"Expert Review of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1477095730,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14789450.2016.1246188"],"pmid":"27718750","pubdate":"2016-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Platelet proteomics applied to the search for novel antiplatelet therapeutic targets","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/platelet-proteomics-applied-search-novel-antiplatelet-therapeutic-targets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":6562039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236516,"mean":12.571077682176,"rank":193118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236516,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318,"mean":1.7793375394322,"rank":256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.5041666666667,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ERJournals\/statuses\/789622840886603776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12860932],"posted_on":"2016-10-22T00:22:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Expert Reviews","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/page\/ExpertReviews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000496751182\/2258702d67dd42cedd317fb79fc5212a_normal.jpeg","description":"Expert Reviews is a leading series of 16 journals providing commentary and analysis on modern healthcare","id_on_source":"ERJournals","tweeter_id":"1886949961","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1285},"tweet_id":"789622840886603776"}]}}
