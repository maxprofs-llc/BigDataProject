A total of 108,928 controls without kidney disease were randomly selected and frequency matched by age, sex, and index year of ESRD patients. The authors established an additional HD cohort matched by propensity scores of PD patients (N = 9,256 each). All cohorts were followed up until the end of 2011 to measure the incidence of AMD.\nThe incidences of AMD were 1.84, 4.03, 5.37, and 3.50 per 1,000 person-years in the control, ESRD (PD and HD), PD, and HD cohorts, respectively. The hazard ratios for AMD were 1.72, 2.47, and 1.43 for the ESRD, PD, and HD cohorts, with 95% confidence intervals of 1.50 to 1.97, 2.05 to 2.98, and 1.22 to 1.68, respectively, compared with the control cohort. The patients on PD exhibited a hazard ratio of 1.74 (95% confidence interval = 1.27-2.38) for developing AMD compared with propensity score-matched patients on HD.\nPatients with ESRD may exhibit a higher risk of AMD than people without kidney disease. Patients on PD may be more likely to develop AMD than patients on HD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008765","authors":["Wang, I-Kuan","Lin, Hui-Ju","Wan, Lei","Lin, Cheng-Li","Yen, Tzung-Hai","Sung, Fung-Chang"],"doi":"10.1097\/iae.0000000000001011","endpage":"1873","first_seen_on":"2016-10-22T02:05:28+00:00","issns":["1539-2864","0275-004X"],"issue":"10","journal":"Retina","last_mentioned_on":1477101915,"links":["http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/retinajournal\/_layouts\/15\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=10000&article=00007&utm_content=buffere70b5&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer#ath","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/retinajournal\/_layouts\/15\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=10000&article=00007&utm_content=buffer794a2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/retinajournal\/_layouts\/15\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=10000&article=00007&utm_content=buffere70b5&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/retinajournal\/2016\/10000\/RISK_OF_AGE_RELATED_MACULAR_DEGENERATION_IN.7.pdf","pmid":"26966867","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1866","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"RISK OF AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION IN END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE PATIENTS RECEIVING LONG-TERM DIALYSIS","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/retinajournal\/Fulltext\/2016\/10000\/RISK_OF_AGE_RELATED_MACULAR_DEGENERATION_IN.7.aspx","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-agerelated-macular-degeneration-endstage-renal-disease-patients-receiving-longterm-dialysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":3359475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4143697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236516,"mean":12.571060347124,"rank":105739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":127393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236516,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1340,"mean":1.3049141150112,"rank":227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1340,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.7714285714286,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sophieb2020\/statuses\/789648783197908993","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12864109],"posted_on":"2016-10-22T02:05:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Sophie J.
