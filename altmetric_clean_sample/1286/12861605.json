The purpose of this study was to investigate short-term changes in passive hip flexion (HF) and extension (HE) after foam rolling (FR) and roller massage (RM) durations of 60 and 120s. Ten recreationally active men (27.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4 years old; 164.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6\u00a0cm; 62.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.0\u00a0kg; 24.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0m(2)\/kg) were recruited for this study. Subjects performed foam rolling (FR) and roller massage (RM) on the hamstrings for 60 (FR60 and RM60) and 120 (FR120 and RM120) seconds. Significant differences between FR120 and RM60 were observed in both HF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and HE (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) suggesting an intervention (roller style) effect. Furthermore, significant differences (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) between RM60 and RM120 suggest a dosage based response. Thus, the findings indicate that different roller type or rolling volume may affect range-of-motion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059fc","authors":["Est\u00eav\u00e3o Rios Monteiro","Mark Tyler Cavanaugh","David Michael Frost","Jefferson da Silva Novaes"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbmt.2016.10.003","first_seen_on":"2016-10-22T00:57:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13608592","1532-9283"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Bodywork & Movement Therapies","last_mentioned_on":1477472990,"links":["http:\/\/www.bodyworkmovementtherapies.com\/article\/S1360-8592(16)30251-0\/fulltext?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.bodyworkmovementtherapies.com\/article\/S1360-8592(16)30251-0\/abstract","http:\/\/www.bodyworkmovementtherapies.com\/article\/S1360-8592(16)30251-0\/fulltext","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28167184"],"pmid":"28167184","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Is self-massage an effective joint range-of-motion strategy?
