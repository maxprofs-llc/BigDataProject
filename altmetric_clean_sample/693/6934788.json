The Coping Long Term with Active Suicide Program (CLASP) has three major components: (1) three individual, in-person meetings, (2) one significant other\/family meeting, and (3) 11 brief (15-30\u00a0minute) phone contacts with the patient and his\/her significant other. Open trial and pilot randomized trial data provide preliminary evidence that CLASP is a feasible, acceptable, and efficacious intervention to reduce suicidal behavior.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035e9","authors":["Miller, Ivan W.","Gaudiano, Brandon A.","Weinstock, Lauren M."],"doi":"10.1111\/sltb.12247","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-04-24T15:48:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1943-278X"],"journal":"Suicide & Life-Threatening Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1461512866,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/sltb.12247"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/sltb.12247\/pdf","pmid":"27038050","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychiatry"],"title":"The Coping Long Term with Active Suicide Program: Description and Pilot Data","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coping-long-term-active-suicide-program-description-pilot-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7596091,"mean":6.5461949734624,"rank":5748180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1019557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7596091,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266682,"mean":11.363961549566,"rank":186832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266682,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":532,"mean":9.1623804143126,"rank":453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":532,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":5.5337777777778,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":3,"Psychology":5,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/KarenSlade2\/statuses\/724263573132861442","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6934788],"posted_on":"2016-04-24T15:47:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Karen Slade","url":"http:\/\/www.ntu.ac.uk\/apps\/staff_profiles\/staff_directory\/125275-2\/26\/karen_slade.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/795650732179525632\/1DCrgBN9_normal.jpg","description":"Forensic Psychologist, lecturer, researcher; Interests: Prisons-suicide\/violence; distance runs & organic veg.
