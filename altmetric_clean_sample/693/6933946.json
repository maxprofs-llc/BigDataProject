Reports on cutaneous tumor seeding after percutaneous RFA for colorectal liver metastasis are even rarer in the literature. Here we report a case of a 46-year-old female who developed an ulcerating skin lesion along the needle track of a previous percutaneous RFA site around 6 mo after the procedure. The previous RFA was performed by the LeVeen needle for a secondary liver tumor from a primary rectal cancer. The diagnosis of secondary skin metastasis was confirmed by fine needle aspiration cytology. The lesion was successfully treated with wide local excision. We believe that tumor seeding after percutaneous RFA in our patient was possibly related to its unfavorable subcapsular location and the use of an expansion-type needle. Hence, prophylactic ablation of the needle track should be performed whenever possible. Otherwise, alternative routes of tumor ablation such as laparoscopic or open RFA should be considered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Shirley Yuk-Wah Liu","Kit-Fai Lee","Paul Bo-San Lai"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.15.1653","first_seen_on":"2016-04-24T13:11:27+00:00","issns":["2219-2840","1007-9327"],"issue":"13","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1461503616,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2669953\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2669953","pmid":"19340913","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Baishideng Publishing Group Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1653","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Needle track seeding: a real hazard after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for colorectal liver metastasis","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/needle-track-seeding-real-hazard-after-percutaneous-radiofrequency-ablation-colorectal-liver-metasta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7596091,"mean":6.5461949734624,"rank":5478996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1847934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7596091,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266683,"mean":11.363962299668,"rank":171567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":79849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266683,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3368,"mean":2.8289123849124,"rank":1729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3368,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.3977272727273,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
