A cementless acetabular component was used in all hips. There were 125 men and 46 women. The mean age at the time of the arthroplasty was 47.7\u00b110.7years (range, 21-50years).\nThe average Harris hip scores were similar between the groups of cemented stem (mean, 91 points) and cementless stem (93 points). Survival rate of the acetabular component (79% vs 78%) and that of the femoral component (96% vs 95%) at 26.1years were similar between the 2 groups.\nThe long-term fixation of the acetabular metallic shell and cemented or cementless femoral stem was outstanding. Polyethylene wear and periacetabular osteolysis were contributing factors to reduce the long-term survival of the contemporary total hip arthroplasties with or without cement in young patients. New bearing surfaces such as ceramic on ceramic or ceramic on highly cross-linked polyethylene would improve wear of the bearing surfaces.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Young-Hoo Kim","Jang-Won Park","Jun-Shik Kim","In-Woo Kim"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arth.2015.09.045","endpage":"667","first_seen_on":"2016-04-24T14:01:48+00:00","issns":["1532-8406"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Journal of Arthroplasty","last_mentioned_on":1461506478,"links":["http:\/\/www.arthroplastyjournal.org\/article\/S0883-5403%2815%2900883-9\/abstract?showall=true="],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.arthroplastyjournal.org\/article\/S0883540315008839\/pdf","pmid":"26601637","pubdate":"2015-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"662","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Twenty-Five- to Twenty-Seven-Year Results of a Cemented vs a Cementless Stem in the Same Patients Younger Than 50 Years of Age","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/twentyfive-twentysevenyear-results-cemented-vs-cementless-stem-same-patients-younger-50-years-age"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7596091,"mean":6.5461949734624,"rank":5748183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1019552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7596091,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266683,"mean":11.363925311794,"rank":186832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266683,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1210,"mean":4.8321356492969,"rank":861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1210,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":6.3590476190476,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
