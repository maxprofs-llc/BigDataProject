To obtain a summary odds ratio, the Mantel-Haenszel method was used. A test to verify absence of heterogeneity was also performed.\nOne unpublished case-control and four published cohort studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were not statistically heterogeneous. A summary odds ratio was calculated for metronidazole exposure during the first trimester: OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.90-1.29, heterogeneity test chi2 = 4.72, P = 0.32.\nThis meta-analysis did not find any relationship between metronidazole exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy and birth defects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243e","authors":["Caro-Pat\u00f3n, T","Carvajal, A","Martin de Diego, I","Martin-Arias, L H","Alvarez Requejo, A","Rodr\u00edguez Pinilla, E"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-03T14:27:45+00:00","issns":["0306-5251"],"issue":"2","journal":"British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1496867976,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9278206"],"pmcid":"PMC2042833","pmid":"9278206","pubdate":"1997-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Is metronidazole teratogenic?
