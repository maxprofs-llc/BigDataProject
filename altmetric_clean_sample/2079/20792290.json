Then Core-shell structured CeO2\/Co3O4\/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composite nanofibers were fabricated through a redox reaction between the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer and Co3O4 on the surface of CeO2\/Co3O4 composite nanofibers. The morphology and composition of the two composite nanofibers were confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements. Due to the synergistic effect between CeO2 and Co3O4, the catalytic activity was enhanced compared to that of the independent oxide nanofibers. After the growth of PEDOT, the catalytic activity process is further improved, having achieved a secondary synergistic effect. Application of the two prepared composite nanofibers as peroxidase-like catalysts for the colorimetric detection of H2O2 was investigated. It is anticipated that this work can inspire researchers to develop various of novel functional nanocomposites for applications in biosensing and environmental monitoring.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["Chi, Maoqiang","Zhu, Yun","Yang, ZeZhou","Gao, Mu","Chen, Sihui","Song, Na","Wang, Ce","Lu, Xiaofeng","Maoqiang Chi","Yun Zhu","ZeZhou Yang","Mu Gao","Sihui Chen","Na Song","Ce Wang","Xiaofeng Lu"],"doi":"10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa76bc","first_seen_on":"2017-06-03T10:10:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0957-4484","1361-6528"],"journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1496484609,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28574399?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa76bc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa76bc\/pdf","pmid":"28574399","pubdate":"2017-06-03T22:04:16+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"A strongly coupled CeO2\/Co3O4\/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanofibers with enhanced nanozyme activity for highly sensitive colorimetric detection","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":7188621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241989,"mean":12.178602376977,"rank":197018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241989,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1609,"mean":5.963315920398,"rank":1390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1609,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":3.8104210526316,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiosensorPapers\/statuses\/870945693015302145","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20792290],"posted_on":"2017-06-03T10:10:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Biosensor Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706647650213363712\/BpK5-z3e_normal.jpg","description":"Pubmed Twitterbot for #biosensor papers.
