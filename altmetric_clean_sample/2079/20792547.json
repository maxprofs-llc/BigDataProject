Copy number variations (CNVs) are large structural variations affecting the human genome. CNVs influence critical genes involved in causing NDJ by altering their copy number which affects the clinical outcome. In this study influence of CNVs on critical meiotic recombination was examined using new computational technologies to assess their role in causing aneuploidy.\nThis investigation was based on the analysis of 12 random normal populations consisting of 1714 individuals for aneuploid causing genes under CNV effect. To examine the effect of CNVs on genes causing aneuploidy, meiotic recombination genes were analyzed using EnrichR, WebGestalt and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).\nForty three NDJ genes were found under CNV burden; IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis of CNV in meiotic recombination genes revealed a significant role of breast cancer gene 1, amyloid protein precursor, mitogen-activated protein kinase and nerve growth factor as key molecular players involved in causing aneuploidy. Interaction between these genes with other CNV-overlapping genes involved in cell cycle, recombination and meiosis might lead to increased incidences of aneuploidy.\nThe findings of this study implied that the effect of CNVs on normal genome contributed in amplifying the occurrences of chromosomal aneuploidies. The normal individuals consisting of variations in the susceptible genes causing aneuploids in the population remain undetected until the disorder genes express in the succeeding generations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aad","authors":["Ramachandra, NallurB","Suresh, RavirajV","Lingaiah, Kusuma","Veerappa, AvinashM"],"doi":"10.4103\/ijmr.ijmr_965_14","first_seen_on":"2017-06-03T10:21:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0971-5916"],"issue":"1","journal":"Indian Journal of Medical Research","last_mentioned_on":1496485261,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28574013"],"pmid":"28574013","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Identifying the risk of producing aneuploids using meiotic recombination genes as biomarkers: A copy number variation approach","type":"article","volume":"145"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":7188622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241990,"mean":12.178552049886,"rank":197018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241990,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":700,"mean":3.7193590844063,"rank":520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":700,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.22,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/meiosis_papers\/statuses\/870948427571449856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20792547],"posted_on":"2017-06-03T10:21:01+00:00","author":{"name":"meiosispapers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/pmcarlton\/pubmed-rss-twitter","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/694039532400832512\/SSjYg2IY_normal.png","description":"Recent meiosis papers from pubmed RSS and bioR\u03c7iv.
