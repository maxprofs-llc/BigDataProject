Despite this level of progress, over 40% of people living with HIV remain unaware of their HIV status. This calls for innovative approaches to improve uptake of HIV testing services, including use of HIV self-test (HIVST) kits. We conducted a cross-sectional, qualitative study to assess pregnant women and their male partners' perceptions regarding female partner-delivered HIVST kits. This study was conducted at two health facilities in Central Uganda between November and December 2015. Data were collected on pregnant women's willingness to take HIVST kits to their male partners and other household members using eight focus group discussions and 30 in-depth interviews. Data were analyzed following a thematic framework approach. Overall, pregnant women were willing to take HIVST kits to their partners and other household members, with the exception of their cowives. Male partners were willing to use HIVST kits brought by their female partners. Our findings suggest that secondary distribution of HIVST kits through female partners is acceptable and has the potential to improve male partner and household-member HIV testing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006615","authors":["Joseph KB Matovu","Esther Buregyeya","Jim Arinaitwe","Rhoda K Wanyenze","Joseph KB Matovu","Esther Buregyeya","Jim Arinaitwe","Rhoda K Wanyenze"],"doi":"10.1177\/0956462417705800","first_seen_on":"2017-06-03T13:37:43+00:00","issns":["0956-4624","1758-1052"],"journal":"International Journal of STD & AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1496497052,"links":["https:\/\/www.growkudos.com\/publications\/10.1177%252F0956462417705800?i=1717647"],"pmid":"28449628","pubdate":"2017-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"\u2018. . . if you bring the kit home, you [can] get time and test together with your partner\u2019: Pregnant women and male partners\u2019 perceptions regarding female partner-delivered HIV self-testing in Uganda \u2013 A qualitative study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bring-kit-home-time-test-together-partner-pregnant-women-male-partners-perceptions-regarding-female"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":4427008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2314653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241989,"mean":12.178570970461,"rank":133516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":85701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241989,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1264,"mean":2.647486935867,"rank":847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1264,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":3.5538461538462,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":2,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/matovujkb1\/statuses\/870997885252403200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20794926],"posted_on":"2017-06-03T13:37:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Joseph Matovu","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"matovujkb1","tweeter_id":"2198331794","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5},"tweet_id":"870997885252403200"}]}}
