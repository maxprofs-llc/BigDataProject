The study also sought to examine the relationship between causal beliefs and the perceived helpfulness of different treatments.\nA total of 219 clinicians completed a questionnaire about the provision of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and antipsychotic medication for their clients who were experiencing psychosis and their opinions about the helpfulness of these treatments. Causal beliefs were also assessed.\nClients were twice as likely to be offered medication compared to CBT. Clinicians held a multifactorial model of aetiology, but were more likely to endorse psychosocial causes than biological factors. Clinicians with psychosocial beliefs were more likely to rate CBT as effective, whereas those with biological models were more likely to endorse the helpfulness of medication. Clinicians adopt a multi-causal approach when conceptualising the aetiology of psychosis and these beliefs were related to opinions about the helpfulness of treatment. Beliefs about the aetiology of their client's experiences could blind clinicians to the benefits of offering different approaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ba2","authors":["Carter, Lucy","Read, John","Pyle, Melissa","Law, Heather","Morrison, Anthony P","Lucy Carter","John Read","Melissa Pyle","Heather Law","Anthony P Morrison"],"doi":"10.1177\/0020764017709849","first_seen_on":"2017-06-03T17:54:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-7640","1741-2854"],"journal":"International Journal of Social Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1497549695,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0020764017709849#.WTL3nUhnXrs.twitter","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0020764017709849?utm_content=bufferd9f23&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0020764017709849","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/0020764017709849"],"pmid":"28552026","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Mental health clinicians\u2019 beliefs about the causes of psychosis: Differences between professions and relationship to treatment preferences","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mental-health-clinicians-beliefs-about-causes-psychosis-differences-between-professions-relationship"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.55,"score_history":{"1y":5.55,"6m":5.55,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8450823,"mean":7.1040726996654,"rank":1538385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6906995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8450823,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248060,"mean":12.617510551925,"rank":60288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":187417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248060,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":752,"mean":3.5045645805593,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":752,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.675,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":6,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EricaEassom\/statuses\/871062528146722817","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20797942],"posted_on":"2017-06-03T17:54:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Erica Eassom","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/657289327794368513\/ypTCg0_x_normal.jpg","description":"ClinPsy Trainee.
