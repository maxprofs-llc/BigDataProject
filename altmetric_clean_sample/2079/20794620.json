Does intra vs extracellular inhibition effect this?","PCSK9 and Atherosclerosis; Lipids Beyond"],"citation":{"abstract":"Even though it is only a little over a decade from the discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) as a plasma protein that associates with both high and low cholesterol syndromes, a rich body of knowledge has developed, and drugs inhibiting this target have been approved in many markets. While the majority of research in recent years has focused on the impact of therapeutic antagonism of this molecule, important lines of investigation have emerged characterizing its unique physiology as it relates to cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis. The PCSK9 story is unfolding rapidly but is far from complete. One chapter that is of particular interest is the possible direct link between PCSK9 and atherosclerosis. This review specifically examines this relationship drawing from data produced from experimental models of plaque biology and inflammation, atherosclerosis imaging studies, and observational epidemiology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccd1","authors":["Michael D.
