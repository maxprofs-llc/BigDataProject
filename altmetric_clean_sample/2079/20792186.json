Although the use of laparoscopy in oncology is rapidly growing worldwide, its efficacy in pancreatic surgery remains controversial. A number of studies have compared outcomes of minimally invasive and open pancreatic resections. However, they are mostly non-randomized trials including relatively small groups of patients. In addition, most of these studies were conducted in high-volume pancreatic centres. It seems that despite longer operative time, laparoscopy may be beneficial in terms of morbidity, blood loss and hospital stay. Thus far, very little is known about the long-term outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for pancreatic cancer. Our aim was to review current evidence for the use of minimally invasive techniques in patients with pancreatic malignancy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f61000812e","authors":["P\u0119dziwiatr, Micha\u0142","Ma\u0142czak, Piotr","Major, Piotr","Witowski, Jan","Ku\u015bnierz-Cabala, Beata","Ceranowicz, Piotr","Budzy\u0144ski, Andrzej"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12032-017-0984-4","first_seen_on":"2017-06-03T10:07:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1357-0560","1559-131X"],"issue":"7","journal":"Medical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1496499733,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28573639?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28573639","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Minimally invasive pancreatic cancer surgery: What is the current evidence?","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/minimally-invasive-pancreatic-cancer-surgery-current-evidence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":6011432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2005627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241989,"mean":12.178555060581,"rank":156525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":71233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241989,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":569,"mean":1.6987183098592,"rank":247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":569,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.9044117647059,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/870944925172482049","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20792186],"posted_on":"2017-06-03T10:07:06+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"870944925172482049"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/KutluMD\/statuses\/871009128944214016","license":"gnip","rt":["HPB_surgery"],"citation_ids":[20792186],"posted_on":"2017-06-03T14:22:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Onur Kutlu","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgeon.
