The clinical management of these diseases has certain similarities and differences. We employed medical strategy analysis to test the utility of genetic diagnostics in the management of GAS. We chose the standpoint of the cardiologist for our analysis. In the first step, the medical goals in the management of GAS are specified. In the second step, the accuracy of genetic diagnostics for GAS is examined. Finally, conclusions can be drawn about the utility of genetic diagnostics in managing GAS. We found that genetic diagnostics is necessary to exclude GAS, to diagnose GAS, and to specify disease types. Second, combining phenotype with genotype information maximizes the predictability of the course of disease. Third, with genetic diagnostics it is possible to predict the birth of children with causative mutations for GAS and to initiate drug therapy to prevent the onset of aortic dilatation or to slow down its progression to aortic aneurysm. Finally, genetic diagnostics improves prognostic predictions and thereby contributes to a better timing of elective surgery and to a better choice of procedures. The findings of our medical strategy analysis indicate the high utility of genetic diagnostics for managing GAS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007623","authors":["Y. von Kodolitsch","K.
