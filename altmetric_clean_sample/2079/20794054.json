The intervention group (n = 160) attended a cognitive cooperation group (20 sessions of 1.5 hours each). The control group (n = 133) received routine medical care. Outcome was the percent variation in the MMSE. Control variables included gender, age, marital status, schooling, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypothyroidism, depression, vascular diseases, polymedication, use of benzodiazepines, exposure to tobacco, sedentary lifestyle, obesity and functional capacity. The final model was obtained by multivariate linear regression.\nThe intervention group obtained an independent positive variation of 24.39% (CI 95% = 14.86\/33.91) in the MMSE compared to the control group.\nThe results suggested that cognitive cooperation groups, mediated by computers and the internet, are associated with cognitive status improvement of older adults in memory clinics.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e22a83eeb12a8b4a61","authors":["Rodrigo de Rosso Krug","Anna Quialheiro Abreu da Silva","Ione Jayce Ceola Schneider","Luiz Roberto Ramos","Eleonora d\u2019Orsi","Andr\u00e9 Junqueira Xavier"],"doi":"10.1590\/0004-282x20170021","first_seen_on":"2017-06-03T12:22:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0004-282X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria","last_mentioned_on":1496492525,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28489142?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28489142","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Cognitive cooperation groups mediated by computers and internet present significant improvement of cognitive status in older adults with memory complaints: a controlled prospective study","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cognitive-cooperation-groups-mediated-computers-internet-present-significant-improvement-cognitive-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":4427011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2314652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241990,"mean":12.178533040758,"rank":133517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":85699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241990,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":437,"mean":2.0997660550459,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":437,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.096875,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
