Several evaluation techniques are commonly applied that tackle specific aspects of AAL; however, holistic evaluation approaches are lacking when addressing the needs of both developers and end-users. Living labs have been often used as real-life test and experimentation environments for co-designing AAL technologies and validating them with relevant stakeholders. During the last five years, we have been evaluating AAL systems and services in the framework of various research projects. This paper presents the lessons learned in this experience and proposes a set of harmonized guidelines to conduct evaluations in living labs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Juan Colomer","Dario Salvi","Maria Cabrera-Umpierrez","Maria Arredondo","Patricia Abril","Viveca Jimenez-Mixco","Rebeca Garc\u00eda-Betances","Alessio Fioravanti","Matteo Pastorino","Jorge Cancela","Alejandro Medrano"],"doi":"10.3390\/s140407277","first_seen_on":"2014-04-23T09:18:57+00:00","issns":["1424-8220",""],"issue":"4","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1424988913,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/14\/4\/7277","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/14\/4\/7277\/htm","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/s140407277"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/14\/4\/7277\/pdf","pmid":"24763209","pubdate":"2014-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Experience in Evaluating AAL Solutions in Living Labs","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/experience-evaluating-aal-solutions-living-labs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8084912,"mean":6.8668028996157,"rank":3374094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4659663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8084912,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177510,"mean":7.4009887160654,"rank":58649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":117416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177510,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3320,"mean":1.8981072612233,"rank":517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3320,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":2.3257631578947,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
