The RPA correlation energy has been expressed as a ring coupled cluster doubles (rCCD) theory. The resulting analytical gradients have been implemented and tested for geometry optimization of simple molecules and intermolecular charge transfer complexes, where intermolecular interactions are expected to have a non-negligible effect even on geometrical parameters of the monomers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["Bastien Mussard","P\u00e9ter G.
