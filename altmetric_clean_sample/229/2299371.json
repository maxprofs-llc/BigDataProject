Drawing on criminal career data from a nonprobability sample of 618 confined male homicide offenders selected from eight U.S. states, the current study examines the role of rape as a predictor of multiple homicide offending. Bivariate analyses indicated a significant association between rape and murder charges. Multivariate path regression models indicated that rape had a significant and robust association with multiple murder. This relationship withstood the confounding effects of kidnapping, prior prison confinement, and prior murder, rape, and kidnapping. These results provide evidence that rape potentially serves as a gateway to multiple murder for some serious offenders. Suggestions for future research are proffered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db2","authors":["DeLisi M"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-23T15:51:38+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Forensic Sciences (Blackwell Publishing Limited)","last_mentioned_on":1399606229,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24745077"],"pmid":"24745077","pubdate":"2014-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"An empirical study of rape in the context of multiple murder.","type":"article","volume":"59"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3731357,"mean":4.9821613654696,"rank":2987190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3731357,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95190,"mean":7.1609243294919,"rank":75723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95190,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":779,"mean":3.6871079691517,"rank":616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":779,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.1269230769231,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hlth_Literacy\/status\/458996386227552256","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2299371],"posted_on":"2014-04-23T15:50:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Health Literacy","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731064960\/LiteracyII_normal.jpg","description":"Eclectic health info, Health Literacy  Also @HIV_Insight @Prison_Health, @Why_We_Do_That, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Hlth_Literacy","tweeter_id":"77314206","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":6036},"tweet_id":"458996386227552256"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hlth_Literacy\/status\/464608319152599040","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2299371],"posted_on":"2014-05-09T03:30:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Health Literacy","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731064960\/LiteracyII_normal.jpg","description":"Eclectic health info, Health Literacy  Also @HIV_Insight @Prison_Health, @Why_We_Do_That, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Hlth_Literacy","tweeter_id":"77314206","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":6036},"tweet_id":"464608319152599040"}]}}
