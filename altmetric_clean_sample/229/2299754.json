Rightly or wrongly, if a degree of confusion is apparent, it is often questioned whether the person is able to return to the previous place of residence. We wished to understand how, on medical wards, judgements about capacity and best interests with respect to going home are made for people with dementia and how decision-making around hospital discharge for people with dementia and their families might be improved. Our research reflects the jurisdiction in which we work, but the importance of residence capacity rests on its implications for basic human rights.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ba","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2318-14-56","first_seen_on":"2014-04-23T18:59:02+00:00","issns":["1471-2318"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Geriatrics","last_mentioned_on":1430406186,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2318\/14\/56\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2318-14-56.pdf","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2318\/14\/56","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4005620\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2318-14-56.pdf","pmid":"24758694","pubdate":"2014-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"56","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Going home?
