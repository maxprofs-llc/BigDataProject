We recently showed that positive emotions induced by repeated tickling could modulate fear-related behaviors and sympatho-adrenal stress responses. In the present study, we examined whether tickling during early to late adolescence stage could reverse stress vulnerability induced by socially isolated rearing. Ninety-five male Fischer rats were reared under different conditions from postnatal day (PND) 21 to 53: group-housed (three rats\/cage), isolated-nontickled (one rat\/cage) and isolated-tickled (received tickling stimulation for 5min a day). Auditory fear conditioning was then performed on the rats at PND 54. Isolated-tickled rats exhibited significantly lower freezing compared with group-housed rats in the first retention test performed 48h after conditioning and compared with isolated-nontickled rats in the second retention test performed 96h after conditioning. Moreover, group-housed and isolated-tickled rats tended to show a significant decrease in freezing responses in the second retention test; however, isolated-nontickled rats did not. In the Morris water maze task that was trained in adulthood (PND 88), but not in adolescence (PND 56), isolated-nontickled rats showed slower decrease of escape latency compared to group-housed rats; however, tickling treatment significantly improved this deficit. These results suggest that tickling stimulation can alleviate the detrimental effects of isolated rearing during adolescence on fear responses and spatial learning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003325","authors":["Hori M","Yamada K","Ohnishi J","Sakamoto S","Furuie H","Murakami K","Ichitani Y"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.physbeh.2014.04.008","endpage":"67","first_seen_on":"2014-04-21T02:35:48+00:00","issns":["00319384","0031-9384"],"journal":"Physiology & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1478898364,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0031938414001991","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24727339"],"pmid":"24727339","pubdate":"2014-04-09T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"62","title":"Tickling during adolescence alters fear-related and cognitive behaviors in rats after prolonged isolation","type":"article","volume":"131","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tickling-during-adolescence-alters-fearrelated-cognitive-behaviors-rats-after-prolonged-isolation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19.43,"score_history":{"1y":15.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19.43},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7679268,"mean":6.5932591477757,"rank":386066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7293225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7679268,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175025,"mean":7.2248301947164,"rank":11224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":163801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175025,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2342,"mean":8.4793199487398,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2342,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":20.621957446809,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
