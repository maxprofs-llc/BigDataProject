Hence, it is thought to be necessary to investigate this problem from the virological and bacteriological point of view. The role of pathogenic bacteria and viruses in six different towns of North Province (Al-Assafia, Arar, Domat Aljandal, Hail, Skaka and Khoa) in Saudi Arabia was studied. Survey was conducted in diarrheic camel calves aged 12\u00a0months or younger. In our study calf diarrhea was reported in 184 out of 2308 camels examined clinically during one year, the prevalence of diarrhea was found to be 8.0% in calves ranging from one month to one year. In the present study group A rotavirus and Brucella abortus were detected in 14.7% and 8.98%, respectively, using ELISA technique. Escherichia coli was isolated from diarrheic calf camel (58.2%) 99\/170 samples during dry and wet season. Salmonella spp. and Enterococcus spp. were detected in 12% and 8.8% of the specimens, respectively. In this study enterotoxogenic E. coli (ET E. coli) was isolated from 7% of diarrheic camel, which indicates the strong correlation between the camel calf diarrhea and the detection of enterotoxogenic E. coli. This study represented the first report for the detection of group A rotavirus and B. abortus antigen and antibodies in calf camels in Saudi Arabia. It is recommended that the disease should be controlled by vaccination in calf camels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f61000888f","authors":["Al-Ruwaili MA","Khalil OM","Selim SA"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.sjbs.2011.10.001","first_seen_on":"2014-04-23T02:39:44+00:00","issns":["1319562X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1443619684,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1319562X11000672"],"pmcid":"PMC3730540","pmid":"23961160","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Viral and bacterial infections associated with camel (Camelus dromedarius) calf diarrhea in North Province, Saudi Arabia ","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/viral-bacterial-infections-associated-camel-camelus-dromedarius-calf-diarrhea-north-province-saudi-a-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7503399,"mean":6.4954816655027,"rank":3652572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3661333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7503399,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173924,"mean":7.182688948558,"rank":75006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":93172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173924,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":2.2507638888889,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
