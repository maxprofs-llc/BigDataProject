Delineated volumetric changes of DCE-MRI, ADC-DWI, and FDG-PET were assessed in comparison with the finding on 3-dimensional\/4-dimensional CT with and without intravenous contrast, and with pathology specimens for resectable and borderline resectable cases of pancreatic cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b96","authors":["Dalah, Entesar","Moraru, Ion","Paulson, Eric","Erickson, Beth","Li, X.
