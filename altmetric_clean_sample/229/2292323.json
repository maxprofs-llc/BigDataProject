One motivation gain phenomenon has shown promise for motivating greater effort in partnered exergames: The K\u00f6hler effect (working at a task with a more capable partner where one's performance is indispensable to the group). This article examines whether a K\u00f6hler effect can be demonstrated in an exergame by exercising with a moderately superior humanoid, software-generated partner.\nMale and female (n=120; mean age, 19.41 years) college students completed a series of plank exercises using \"CyBuddy Exercise,\" a program developed specifically for this study. In a lab in an academic building, participants completed the exercises individually and, after a rest, were randomly assigned to complete the same exercises again, but with a \"live\" human partner (HP) presented virtually, a nearly-human-like, humanoid partner (NHP), a hardly human-like, software-generated partner (HHP), or a no-partner control condition (IC), with equal numbers in each group (i.e., n=30). Exercise persistence, perceived exertion, self-efficacy beliefs, enjoyment, and intentions to exercise were recorded and analyzed.\nA 4\u00d72 analysis of variance on the (Block 2 - Block 1) difference scores showed that a significant K\u00f6hler motivation gain was observed in all partner conditions (compared with IC), but persistence was significantly greater with HPs than with either NHP or HHP humanoid partners (P<0.05). By the conclusion of the study, there were no significant differences among the partnered conditions in perceived exertion, self-efficacy, enjoyment, or future intentions to exercise.\nThese results suggest that a software-generated partner can elicit the K\u0151hler motivation gain in exergames, but not as strongly as a partner who is thought to be human.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa80d3cf058f61000baf7","authors":["Deborah L.
