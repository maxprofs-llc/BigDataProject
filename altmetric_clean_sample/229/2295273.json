Electric-field-induced metallization of such materials from their insulating states could enable a new class of ultrafast electronic switches and latches. However, significant questions remain about the detailed nature of the switching process. Here, we show, in the canonical metal-to-insulator transition system V\u2082O\u2083, that ultrafast voltage pulses result in its metallization only after an incubation time that ranges from \u223c150 ps to many nanoseconds, depending on the electric field strength. We show that these incubation times can be accounted for by purely thermal effects and that intrinsic electronic-switching mechanisms may only be revealed using larger electric fields at even shorter timescales.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000426d","authors":["Justin S.
