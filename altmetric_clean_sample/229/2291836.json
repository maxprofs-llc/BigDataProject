A highly accuracy dental impression material was used to prepare casts of these marks which were examined and photomicrographed, confirming that they had in fact been produced by human teeth. Casts and photomicrographs of the suspect's teeth were made in order to record the fine details of the casts of the dentition. Unique characteristics evident on these casts included a small notch on the incisal edge of the upper right lateral incisor, wear facets on the incisal edges of the upper central incisors and on the lower right lateral incisor and a space of approximately 1.5 mm between the upper left central incisor and lateral incisor which was rotated about 20 degrees distally. Both direct and photomicrographic comparisons between the casts of the chocolates and of the suspect's dentition revealed correspondence between their unique characteristics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa91d3cf058f61000d40e","authors":["C J McKenna","M I Haron","K A Brown","A J Jones"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-20T13:18:00+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0258-414X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of forensic odonto stomatology","last_mentioned_on":1398000059,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11324087"],"pmid":"11324087","pubdate":"2000-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","jurisprudence"],"title":"Bitemarks in chocolate: a case report.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bitemarks-chocolate-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2043579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2981965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123802,"mean":7.9855715543496,"rank":42974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":80505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123802,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.0125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CycleZweetly\/status\/457870859919564800","license":"datasift","rt":["Thejournalofmed"],"citation_ids":[2291836],"posted_on":"2014-04-20T13:18:14+00:00","author":{"name":"CycleZweetly","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2003071458\/IMG_3663_normal.jpg","description":"Cyclist, dad, husband, social documentary photographer, anti-apartheid war resister, scuba-diver, psychiatrist, atheist, oenophile,   & Gooner","id_on_source":"CycleZweetly","tweeter_id":"49130268","geo":{"lt":"51.5072759","ln":"-0.1276597","country":"GB"},"followers":262},"tweet_id":"457870859919564800"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/addiction_genes\/status\/457871552282124288","license":"datasift","rt":["Thejournalofmed"],"citation_ids":[2291836],"posted_on":"2014-04-20T13:20:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Parker Lab","url":"http:\/\/www.parker-lab.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439696079722778624\/WT8f0Rln_normal.jpeg","description":"Science, genetics, neuropharmacology and psychiatry","id_on_source":"addiction_genes","tweeter_id":"1294304588","geo":{"lt":38.93511,"ln":-74.90601,"country":"US"},"followers":489},"tweet_id":"457871552282124288"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Thejournalofmed\/status\/457870659021193216","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2291836],"posted_on":"2014-04-20T13:17:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Journal of Medicine","url":"http:\/\/www.thejournalofmedicine.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1124425349\/twitter_logo_normal.jpg","description":"The worlds 1st medical micro journal.
