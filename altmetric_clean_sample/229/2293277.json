Forty normal nose breathers were selected by detecting expiratory airflow from the mouth using a CO2 sensor. Chest measurements were recorded using a Piezo respiratory belt transducer, and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the masseter and trapezius muscles were recorded at rest and while chewing gum during nasal or oral breathing. Oral breathing was introduced by completely occluding the nostrils with a nose clip. During oral breathing, the respiration rate was significantly lower while chewing gum than while at rest (P < 0.05). While chewing gum, the respiration rate was significantly lower during oral breathing than during nasal breathing (P < 0.05). During oral breathing, thoracic movement was significantly higher while chewing gum than while at rest (P < 0.05). Thoracic movement was significantly greater during oral breathing than during nasal breathing (P < 0.05). The trapezius muscle exhibited significant EMG activity when chewing gum during oral breathing. The activity of the trapezius muscle coincided with increased movement of the thoracic wall. Chewing food while breathing through the mouth interferes with and decreases the respiratory cycle and promotes unusual respiratory movement of the thoracic wall, which is directed by the activity of accessory muscles of respiration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b71","authors":["Shigeru Daimon","Kazunori Yamaguchi"],"doi":"10.1152\/japplphysiol.01236.2013","first_seen_on":"2014-04-21T12:25:40+00:00","issns":["1522-1601"],"journal":"Journal of Applied Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1398189765,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24744386","http:\/\/jap.physiology.org\/content\/early\/2014\/04\/07\/japplphysiol.01236.2013"],"pmid":"24744386","pubdate":"2014-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Changes in respiratory activity induced by mastication during oral breathing in the human.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changes-respiratory-activity-induced-mastication-during-oral-breathing-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1986928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107081,"mean":7.7554328352636,"rank":43377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":60975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107081,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2609,"mean":7.294268404908,"rank":1419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2609,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":18.034838709677,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Sports and Recreations":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Stefan_DeSmet\/status\/458219965783748608","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2293277],"posted_on":"2014-04-21T12:25:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefan De Smet","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2843697965\/3043c4852fbee0e6eddd5bbaf3058b2a_normal.jpeg","description":"PhD student in exercise physiology @KU_Leuven - hypoxia, nutrition and sports performance.
