Because serum vitamin D concentration is generally higher in the summer and fall than winter and spring, if vitamin D insufficiency causes BV, then BV would be expected to be more common during seasons with lower vitamin D concentrations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003524","authors":["Klebanoff MA","Turner AN"],"doi":"10.1097\/olq.0000000000000124","first_seen_on":"2014-04-19T18:49:52+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["0148-5717"],"issue":"5","journal":"Sexually Transmitted Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1399531923,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24722382"],"pmid":"24722382","pubdate":"2014-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"Bacterial vaginosis and season, a proxy for vitamin d status.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bacterial-vaginosis-season-proxy-vitamin-d-status"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3554059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124160,"mean":7.9582980049778,"rank":83002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124160,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":761,"mean":3.6876105263158,"rank":578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":761,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.9904761904762,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
