This elongated CAG tract results in an Ataxin-7 protein bearing an expanded polyglutamine (PolyQ) repeat. SCA7 disease is characterized by progressive neural and retinal degeneration leading to ataxia and blindness. Evidence gathered from investigating SCA7 and other PolyQ diseases strongly suggest that misregulation of gene expression contributes to neurodegeneration. In fact, Ataxin-7 is a subunit of the essential Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetltransferase (SAGA) chromatin modifying complex that regulates expression of a large number of genes. Here we discuss recent insights into Ataxin-7 function and, considering these findings, propose a model for how polyglutamine expansion of Ataxin-7 may affect Ataxin-7 function to alter chromatin modifications and gene expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"557edcac46ff25d2316639ed","authors":["Ryan D Mohan","Susan M Abmayr","Jerry L Workman"],"doi":"10.4161\/rdis.28859","first_seen_on":"2014-04-20T16:38:07+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["2167-5511"],"journal":"Rare Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1439467968,"links":["https:\/\/www.landesbioscience.com\/\/journals\/rarediseases\/article\/28859\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25054097?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/rdis.28859","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/rdis.28859?hootPostID=f9affe76aa98121dcba4940e16985d7b","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/rdis.28859?hootPostID=7f5d3c7cc466550d626158043e46645f","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/rdis.28859?hootPostID=b8bc04b145324d020246552bb57728f5"],"pmcid":"PMC4091419","pmid":"25054097","pubdate":"2014-04-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","title":"Pulling complexes out of complex diseases","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pulling-complexes-complex-diseases-spinocerebellar-ataxia-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5480753,"mean":6.3648992488607,"rank":2048663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3412577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5480753,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131571,"mean":8.1085490461353,"rank":41282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":89697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131571,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":17.7790625,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
