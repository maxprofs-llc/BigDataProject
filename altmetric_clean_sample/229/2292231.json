T. foetus is an extracellular parasite, which initially adheres to and infects the urogenital tract using a diverse array of surface glycoconjugates, including adhesins and extracellular matrix-binding molecules. However, the cellular mechanisms by which T. foetus colonizes mucosal surfaces and causes tissue damage are not well defined. Several studies have demonstrated the involvement of pathogen or host lipid rafts in cellular events that occur during pathogenesis, including adhesion, invasion and evasion of the immune response. In this study, we demonstrate that detergent-resistant membranes are present in the plasma membrane of T. foetus. We further demonstrate that microdomains are cholesterol-enriched and contain ganglioside GM1-like molecules. In addition, we demonstrate that lipid microdomains do not participate in T. foetus adhesion to host cells. However, the use of agents that disrupt and disorganize the plasma membrane indicated the involvement of the T. foetus lipid microdomains, in cell division and in the formation of endoflagellar forms. Our results suggest that trophozoites and endoflagellar forms present a different plasma membrane organization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f61000864b","authors":["Ivone de Andrade Rosa","Georgia Atella","Marlene Benchimol"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.protis.2014.03.006","first_seen_on":"2014-04-20T18:57:46+00:00","issns":["1618-0941"],"issue":"3","journal":"Protist","last_mentioned_on":1398020007,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24742927?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24742927","pubdate":"2014-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Tritrichomonas foetus Displays Classical Detergent-resistant Membrane Microdomains on its Cell Surface.","type":"article","volume":"165","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tritrichomonas-foetus-displays-classical-detergentresistant-membrane-microdomains-cell-surface"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4200119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123801,"mean":7.9856320193864,"rank":100733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123801,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258,"mean":2.8226692607004,"rank":231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.96470588235294,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
