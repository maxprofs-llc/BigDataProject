A descriptive qualitative approach, using thematic individual interviews, was conducted in 2011 with a sample of 11 advanced practice registered nurses. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The advanced practice registered nurses role barriers had an impact on the role development needs. In turn, the facilitating factors helped encounter the challenges of the role, therefore having an impact on both the current role achievement, as well as contributing to the future role development. The factors hindering and facilitating the advanced practice registered nurses role need to be acknowledged to support the role implementation and planning of the future of the role.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b80","authors":["Jokiniemi, Krista","Haatainen, Kaisa","Pietil\u00e4, Anna\u2010Maija"],"doi":"10.1111\/ijn.12334","endpage":"903","first_seen_on":"2014-04-23T06:27:41+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1440-172X","1322-7114"],"issue":"6","journal":"International Journal of Nursing Practice","last_mentioned_on":1398239213,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ijn.12334\/abstract;jsessionid=BC0E5E28245F7ED2BE8942793C60765B.f01t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ijn.12334\/pdf","pmid":"24754703","pubdate":"2014-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"896","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"From challenges to advanced practice registered nursing role development: Qualitative interview study","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/challenges-advanced-practice-registered-nursing-role-development-qualitative-interview-study-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6305067,"mean":5.9761323370767,"rank":2719105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3534433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6305067,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142187,"mean":7.7861083650994,"rank":62695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":77652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142187,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214,"mean":1.7481784037559,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.1578947368421,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
