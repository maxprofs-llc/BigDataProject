The exposure needed to remove the previously implanted plate may be extensive. To overcome these complications, cervical extension plates which add-on to the initially implanted plate, were developed.\nFourteen fresh frozen human cadaver cervical spines (C2-C7) were divided into two groups of seven for a series of constructs to be tested. In Group 1, an Extender plate which attaches to its own primary plate was tested. In Group 2, a Universal Extender plate which can be placed adjacent to any previously implanted plate was tested. Prepared specimens were mounted on a 6 degree of freedom spine simulator and were sequentially tested in the following order; (1) Intact; (2) Single level plate; (3) Single level plate with extender plates; and (4) Two-level plate. An unconstrained pure moment of \u00b11.5 Nm was used in flexion-extension (FE), lateral bending (LB), and axial rotation (AR).\nAll instrumented constructs significantly reduced ROM compared to the intact condition. In both groups, single level plates with adjacent extender plates demonstrated stability comparable to their respective two-level plates in all loading modes.\nExtender plates give surgeons the opportunity to treat adjacent levels without removing the primary implants, which may reduce the overall risk of damage to vital neurovascular structures. From this cadaveric biomechanical model, both types of extender plates prove to be viable options for treating ALD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e5f","authors":["Kamran Majid","Mark Moldavsky","Saif Khalil","Manasa Gudipally"],"doi":"10.1097\/bsd.0b013e3182a26734","first_seen_on":"2014-04-23T02:05:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-0652","2380-0194"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Spinal Disorders & Techniques (formerly Journal of Spinal Disorders)","last_mentioned_on":1398218697,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jspinaldisorders\/Abstract\/publishahead\/An_In_Vitro_Biomechanical_Study_Evaluating.99334.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jspinaldisorders\/9000\/00000\/An_In_Vitro_Biomechanical_Study_Evaluating.99334.pdf","pmid":"27196137","pubdate":"2014-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"An In-Vitro Biomechanical Study Evaluating Cervical Extension Plates for Stabilizing Degenerated Adjacent Levels","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-biomechanical-study-evaluating-cervical-extension-plates-stabilizing-degenerated-adjacent-leve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":3103928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":972673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107217,"mean":7.7197603529325,"rank":74853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107217,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1044,"mean":1.5543815915628,"rank":651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1044,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2.6646341463415,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JSDTOnline\/status\/458788584812580864","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2297179],"posted_on":"2014-04-23T02:04:57+00:00","author":{"name":"ClinSpineSurg","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jspinaldisorders\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/732656525378867200\/qZRWRWjC_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Spinal Disorders & Techniques features peer-reviewed original articles on diagnosis, management, and surgery for spinal problems.","id_on_source":"JSDTOnline","tweeter_id":"392872174","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":68},"tweet_id":"458788584812580864"}]}}
