To date little is known about the molecular mechanisms that could explain the beneficial effects that bifidobacteria impart to the host. Restriction-modification (R-M) systems have been identified as key obstacles in the genetic accessibility of bifidobacteria, and circumventing these is a prerequisite to attaining a fundamental understanding of bifidobacterial attributes, including the genes that are responsible for health-promoting properties of this clinically and industrially important group of bacteria. The complete genome sequence of B. animalis subsp. lactis CNCM I-2494 is predicted to harbour the genetic determinants for two type II R-M systems, designated BanLI and BanLII. In order to investigate the functionality and specificity of these two putative R-M systems in B. animalis subsp. lactis CNCM I-2494, we employed PacBio SMRT sequencing with associated methylome analysis. In addition, the contribution of the identified R-M systems to the genetic accessibility of this strain was assessed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Mary O Connell Motherway","Debbie Watson","Francesca Bottacini","Tyson A Clark","Richard J Roberts","Jonas Korlach","Peggy Garault","Christian Chervaux","Johan E T van Hylckama Vlieg","Tamara Smokvina","Douwe van Sinderen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0094875","first_seen_on":"2014-04-20T18:46:36+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1398017945,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24743599?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24743599","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Identification of Restriction-Modification Systems of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CNCM I-2494 by SMRT Sequencing and Associated Methylome Analysis.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-restrictionmodification-systems-bifidobacterium-animalis-subsp-lactis-cncm-i2494-smrt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3568150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107140,"mean":7.7646022643484,"rank":83962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107140,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80038,"mean":8.3626837087848,"rank":64751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80038,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3583,"mean":10.969074818537,"rank":3118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3583,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
