Postzygotic barriers can lead to hybrid breakdown, a syndrome that has been documented in several systems, potentially involving the reactivation of transposable elements. In northeastern North America, two lake whitefish lineages have repeatedly colonized postglacial lakes ~12,000 years ago, and a dwarf limnetic species has evolved multiple times from the normal benthic species. Reproductive isolation is incomplete between them; viable hybrids can be generated in the laboratory but significant mortality occurs and is associated with a malformed phenotype in backcross embryos, thus revealing a hybrid breakdown syndrome. By means of RNA-seq analyses, the objective of this study was to determine which genes were misregulated in hybrids and rigorously test the hypothesis of transposable element reactivation. We compared the transcriptomic landscape in pure embryos, F1-hybrids, and healthy and malformed backcrosses at the late embryonic stage. Extensive expression differences consistent with previously documented adaptive divergence between pure normal and dwarf embryos were identified for the first time. Pronounced transcriptome-wide deregulation in malformed backcrosses was observed, with over 15% of transcripts differentially expressed in all comparisons, compared with 1.5% between pure parental forms. Convincing evidence of transposable elements and noncoding transcripts reactivation in malformed backcrosses is presented. We propose that hybrid breakdown likely results from extensive genomic incompatibilities, plausibly encompassing transposable elements. Combined with previous studies, these results reveal synergy among many reproductive barriers, thus maintaining divergence between these two young whitefish species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081dc","authors":["Anne-Marie Dion-C\u00f4t\u00e9","S\u00e9bastien Renaut","Eric Normandeau","Louis Bernatchez"],"doi":"10.1093\/molbev\/msu069","first_seen_on":"2014-04-23T07:24:57+00:00","issns":["1537-1719"],"journal":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1398237905,"links":["http:\/\/mbe.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/31\/5\/1188.abstract.html?etoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/mbe.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/31\/5\/1188.full.pdf","pmid":"24505119","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"RNA-seq Reveals Transcriptomic Shock Involving Transposable Elements Reactivation in Hybrids of Young Lake Whitefish Species","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rnaseq-reveals-transcriptomic-shock-involving-transposable-elements-reactivation-hybrids-young-lake"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3348883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1482180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123826,"mean":7.962867030083,"rank":77829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":41007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123826,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2182,"mean":8.6925181109583,"rank":1937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2182,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":7.7765106382979,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
