It is thus important to evaluate the internal energy distributions of the ions in different parts of an ESI mass spectrometer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086ec","authors":["Rondeau, David","Drahos, L\u00e1szl\u00f3","V\u00e9key, K\u00e1roly"],"doi":"10.1002\/rcm.6899","endpage":"1284","first_seen_on":"2014-04-21T06:54:25+00:00","issns":["1097-0231","0951-4198"],"issue":"11","journal":"Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","last_mentioned_on":1398063206,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.6899\/abstract;jsessionid=793BD69A2E2688B9CE9233CB03290E0A.f01t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.6899\/pdf","pmid":"24760568","pubdate":"2014-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1273","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Internal energy distribution in electrospray ionization: Towards the evaluation of a thermal\u2010like distribution from the multiple\u2010collision model","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/internal-energy-distribution-electrospray-ionization-towards-evaluation-thermallike-distribution-mul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6335899,"mean":5.977107861901,"rank":5393279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6335899,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145726,"mean":7.6973024395267,"rank":119361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145726,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":994,"mean":1.3939939577039,"rank":476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":994,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":0.48207547169811,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
