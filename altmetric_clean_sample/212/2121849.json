Crystallographic determination of 1-3 reveals that increased charge through ligand deprotonation and displacement of chloride leads to equatorial planarity about uranyl as well as a more compact overall coordination geometry. Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectra of 1-3 at the U-4d edges have been recorded using a soft X-ray Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscope (STXM) and reveal the uranium 4d5\/2 and 4d3\/2 transitions at energies associated with uranium in the hexavalent oxidation state. First-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) electronic structure calculations for the complexes have been performed to determine and validate the coordination characteristics, which correspond well to the experimental results.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Roy Copping","Byoungseon Jeon","C.
