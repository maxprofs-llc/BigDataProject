However, its role in cellular senescence remains unclear. MCAK\/Kif2C expression decreased in human primary cells under replicative and premature senescence. MCAK\/Kif2C down-regulation in young cells induced premature senescence. MCAK\/Kif2C overexpression in old cells partially reversed cell senescence. Senescence phenotypes by MCAK\/Kif2C knockdown were observed in p16-knockdown cells, but not in p53-knockdown cells. These results suggest that MCAK\/Kif2C plays an important role in the regulation of cellular senescence through a p53-dependent pathway and might contribute to tissue\/organism aging and protection of cellular transformation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","doi":"10.1016\/j.febslet.2012.10.012","first_seen_on":"2014-02-14T09:45:53+00:00","issns":["00145793"],"journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1392371137,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S001457931200782X"],"pmid":"23098759","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Mitotic centromere-associated kinase (MCAK\/Kif2C) regulates cellular senescence in human primary cells through a p53-dependent pathway","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mitotic-centromereassociated-kinase-mcakkif2c-regulates-cellular-senescence-human-primary-cells-thro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629051,"mean":4.9368884016521,"rank":2016384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629051,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114647,"mean":6.9159694014622,"rank":57590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":31928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114647,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3393,"mean":2.6191898584906,"rank":2662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3393,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.8909090909091,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
