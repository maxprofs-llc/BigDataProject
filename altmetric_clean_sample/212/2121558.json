VDR regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in calcium\/phosphate homeostasis, cellular proliferation and differentiation, and immune response, largely in a ligand-dependent manner. To understand the global function of the vitamin D system in physiopathological processes, great effort has been devoted to the detection of VDR in various tissues and cells, many of which have been identified as vitamin D targets. This review focuses on the tissue- and cell type-specific distribution of VDR throughout the body.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022ff","doi":"10.1016\/j.abb.2012.04.001","first_seen_on":"2014-02-15T17:36:15+00:00","issns":["00039861"],"journal":"Archives of Biochemistry & Biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1406973942,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003986112001324","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/22503810\/"],"pmid":"22503810","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Where is the vitamin D receptor?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-receptor-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2124954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2231336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134322,"mean":7.5896819410221,"rank":58070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":70567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134322,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1675,"mean":2.5126200716846,"rank":1242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1675,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.86875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
