This interaction potential is then incorporated in full close-coupling calculations of rotational excitation\/de-excitation cross sections in He + C3 collisions for rotational levels j = 0, 2, ..., 10 and collision energies up to 1000 cm(-1). Corresponding rate coefficients are reported for temperature between 1 and 100 K. Results are found to be in excellent agreement with available theoretical data that were restricted to the temperature range of 5-15 K. Implications of the computed rate coefficients to astrophysical models of C3 and carbon clusters in interstellar and circumstellar environments are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Daniel G.
