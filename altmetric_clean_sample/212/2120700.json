However, these pro-tumorigenic effects of MSCs are still being discovered and may even involve opposing effects. MSCs can be friends or enemies of cancer cells: they may stimulate tumor development by regulating immune surveillance, growth, and angiogenesis. On the other hand, they may inhibit tumor growth by inhibiting survival signaling such as Wnt and Akt pathway. MSCs have also been proposed as an attractive candidate for the delivery of anti-tumor agents, owing to their ability to home into tumor sites and to secrete cytokines. Detailed information about the mutual interactions between tumor cells and MSCs will undoubtedly lead to safer and more effective clinical therapy for tumors. In this article, we summarize a number of findings to provide current information on the potential roles of MSCs in tumor development; we then discuss the therapeutic potential of engineered MSCs to reveal any meaningful clinical applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000821b","doi":"10.1016\/j.mrfmmm.2014.01.006","first_seen_on":"2014-02-14T13:48:01+00:00","issns":["00275107"],"journal":"Mutation Research\/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis","last_mentioned_on":1392690165,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0027510714000220"],"pmid":"24512984","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Mesenchymal stem cells and cancer: Friends or enemies?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mesenchymal-stem-cells-cancer-friends-enemies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627970,"mean":4.9447382433571,"rank":1810092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1641327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627970,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114528,"mean":6.9227504605903,"rank":49535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":58550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114528,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":610,"mean":3.0464269293924,"rank":356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":610,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.72,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"googleplus":[{"title":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Cancer: Friends or Enemies? http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/...","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/100304422605153946327\/posts\/6phMJgbUGUu","citation_ids":[2120700],"posted_on":"2014-02-18T02:22:45+00:00","summary":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Cancer: Friends or Enemies? http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/...
