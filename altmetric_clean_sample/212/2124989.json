This testing meets various objections and has led to the development of a range of 3R models to Replace, Reduce or Refine the animal models. However, these models must overcome many barriers before being accepted for regulatory risk management purposes. This paper describes the barriers and drivers and options to optimize this acceptance process as identified by two expert panels, one on pharmaceuticals and one on chemicals. To untangle the complex acceptance process, the multilevel perspective on technology transitions is applied. This perspective defines influences at the micro-, meso- and macro level which need alignment to induce regulatory acceptance of a 3R model. This paper displays that there are many similar mechanisms within both sectors that prevent 3R models from becoming accepted for regulatory risk assessment and management. Shared barriers include the uncertainty about the value of the new 3R models (micro level), the lack of harmonization of regulatory requirements and acceptance criteria (meso level) and the high levels of risk aversion (macro level). In optimizing the process commitment, communication, cooperation and coordination are identified as critical drivers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003443","doi":"10.1016\/j.yrtph.2014.02.007","first_seen_on":"2014-02-17T10:59:08+00:00","issns":["02732300"],"journal":"Regulatory Toxicology & Pharmacology: RTP","last_mentioned_on":1398015349,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0273230014000312"],"pmid":"24534000","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Regulatory acceptance and use of 3R models for pharmaceuticals and chemicals: Expert opinions on the state of affairs and the way forward","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulatory-acceptance-3r-models-pharmaceuticals-chemicals-expert-opinions-state-affairs-way-forward"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3061394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":940834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111424,"mean":8.4187691230719,"rank":74861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":23379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111424,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":441,"mean":4.6162227272727,"rank":327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":441,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
