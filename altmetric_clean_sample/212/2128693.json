Ant-angiogenic strategies demonstrated importance in cancer therapy. Cocoa tea (Camellia ptilophylla), a naturally decaffeinated tea commonly consumed as a healthy drink in southern China, had recently been found to be a potential candidate for antiangiogenesis. A novel proanthocyanidin, GC-(4\u21928)-GCG, which consisted of gallocatechin and gallocatechin 3-O gallate moieties, was discovered and thought to be one of the effective candidates for antiangiogenesis. Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the antiangiogenesis activities of GC-(4\u21928)-GCG in vitro and in vivo, and SU5416 was applied as a positive control. The inhibitory effects of GC-(4\u21928)-GCG on three important processes involved in angiogenesis, i.e., proliferation, migration and differentiation, were examined using human microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 by MTT assay, scratch assay and tube formation assay, respectively. Using transgenic zebrafish embryos TG(fli1:EGFP)y1\/+(AB) as an animal model of angiogenesis, the antiangiogenic effect of GC-(4\u21928)-GCG was further verified in vivo. Our results demonstrated that GC-(4\u21928)-GCG significantly inhibited migration (P<.001) and tubule formation (P<.001-.05) of HMEC-1 in dose-dependent manner. Regarding intracellular signal transduction, GC-(4\u21928)-GCG attenuated the phosphorylation of ERK, Akt and p38 dose-dependently in HMEC-1. In zebrafish embryo, the formation of new blood vessels was effectively inhibited by GC-(4\u21928)-GCG in a dose-dependent manner after 3 days of treatment (P<.001-.05). In conclusion, these results revealed that our novel proanthocyanidin, GC-(4\u21928)-GCG might be a potential and promising agent of natural resource to be further developed as an antiangiogenic agent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8f","authors":["Li KK","Liu CL","Tam JC","Kwok HF","Lau CP","Leung PC","Ko CH","Ye CX"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jnutbio.2013.11.006","first_seen_on":"2014-02-18T20:49:11+00:00","issns":["0955-2863"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1408287593,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24524904"],"pmid":"24524904","pubdate":"2014-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"In vitro and in vivo mechanistic study of a novel proanthocyanidin, GC-(4\u21928)-GCG from cocoa tea (Camellia ptilophylla) in antiangiogenesis.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-vivo-mechanistic-study-novel-proanthocyanidin-gc48gcg-cocoa-tea-camellia-ptilophylla-antiangio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":3352964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1481108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125532,"mean":8.6985327289675,"rank":80297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":40535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125532,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":667,"mean":5.1244474474474,"rank":404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":667,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":7.2741111111111,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
