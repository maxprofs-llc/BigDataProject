Femoral osteotomy is attractive to avoid TKA in younger patients with low-grade unicompartmental osteoarthritis and a valgus deformity. However, only limited functional results can be expected for patients with Ahlback grade 2 or greater osteoarthritis. Moreover, because of previous skin incisions and hardware removal, TKA after femoral osteotomy remains a complex procedure with poor functional results. Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty for both the medial and the lateral compartments has been performed since the 1970s. In a patient with involvement of only one compartment, a medial or a lateral UKA can provide a quicker recovery and enhanced function when compared to TKA. In addition, it preserves bone stock and can be \"easily\" revised by a TKA. Technical improvements, combined with strict patient selection, have resulted in ten year survivorships greater than 90%. However, lateral UKA is technically more challenging than medial UKA due to the lower number of indications, as well as the functional anatomy of the lateral compartment. The goals of this article are to present up-to-date information concerning indications, patients' selection, surgical technique and results of lateral compartment UKA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002bc7","authors":["Matthieu Ollivier","Matthew P.
