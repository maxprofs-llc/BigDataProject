These children are frequently cared for by their mothers at home following hospital discharge. Research indicates that these mothers are at high risk for negative mental health outcomes that affect both caregiver and care recipient. The purpose of this randomized controlled pilot trial was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of resourcefulness training (RT), a cognitive-behavioral intervention, among mothers of technology-dependent children. RT was found to be a feasible and acceptable intervention with this population during the 6 week study. The effect size in this pilot study demonstrates initial efficacy and indicates areas for strengthening the intervention protocol. RT is a promising intervention that can be employed by pediatric nurses to assist mothers in the home management of technology-dependent children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005732","authors":["Toly VB","Musil CM","Zauszniewski JA"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.apnr.2013.11.003","first_seen_on":"2014-02-17T20:13:10+00:00","issns":["0897-1897"],"journal":"Applied Nursing Research","last_mentioned_on":1428142355,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.apnr.2013.11.003","http:\/\/www.appliednursingresearch.org\/article\/S0897-1897(13)00124-9\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24355417?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24355417","pubdate":"2013-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Resourcefulness training intervention: A promising approach to improve mental health of mothers with technology-dependent children","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resourcefulness-training-intervention-promising-approach-improve-mental-health-mothers-technologydep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":51.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":51.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4955312,"mean":5.8725269457375,"rank":86940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":4868607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4955312,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123231,"mean":8.6718937920962,"rank":4107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":119119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123231,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":2.6106324786325,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":14.116666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
