A strategy that uses a single deposit without prior protein extraction was utilized to save time and money. Clinical isolates from the Toulouse University hospital were used to evaluate the performance of the Vitek MS compared to that of both routine laboratory techniques and Vitek2. The Vitek MS performed well in the identification of yeasts and Aspergillus fungi (93.2% of correct identifications).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Xavier Iriart","Rose-Anne Lavergne","Judith Fillaux","Alexis Valentin","Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Magnaval","Antoine Berry","Sophie Cassaing"],"doi":"10.1128\/jcm.06713-11","first_seen_on":"2014-02-18T04:11:45+00:00","issns":["1098-660X"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1392696696,"links":["http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/content\/50\/6\/2107.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/content\/50\/6\/2107.full.pdf","pmid":"22495559","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Routine Identification of Medical Fungi by the New Vitek MS Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization\u2013Time of Flight System with a New Time-Effective Strategy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/routine-identification-medical-fungi-new-vitek-ms-matrixassisted-laser-desorption-ionization-time-fl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":2016872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":937070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98724,"mean":7.492254996303,"rank":51001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98724,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2433,"mean":2.5936266447368,"rank":1202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2433,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":1.1236842105263,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
