Since electrodes are the active components that determine the performance of energy storage systems, it is important to rationally design and engineer hierarchical architectures atboth the nano- and macroscale that can enjoy all of the necessary requirements for a perfect electrode. Here we demonstrate a large-scale flexible fabrication of highly porous high-performance multifunctional graphene oxide (GO) and rGO fibers and yarns by taking advantage of the intrinsic soft self-assembly behavior of ultralarge graphene oxide liquid crystalline dispersions. The produced yarns, which are the only practical form of these architectures for real-life device applications, were found to be mechanically robust (Young's modulus in excess of 29 GPa) and exhibited high native electrical conductivity (2508 \u00b1 632 S m(-1)) and exceptionally high specific surface area (2605 m(2) g(-1) before reduction and 2210 m(2) g(-1) after reduction). Furthermore, the highly porous nature of these architectures enabled us to translate the superior electrochemical properties of individual graphene sheets into practical everyday use devices with complex geometrical architectures. The as-prepared final architectures exhibited an open network structure with a continuous ion transport network, resulting in unrivaled charge storage capacity (409 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and rate capability (56 F g(-1) at 100 A g(-1)) while maintaining their strong flexible nature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Seyed Hamed Aboutalebi","Aboutalebi SH","Jalili R","Esrafilzadeh D","Salari M","Gholamvand Z","Aminorroaya Yamini S","Konstantinov K","Shepherd RL","Chen J","Moulton SE","Innis PC","Minett AI","Razal JM","Wallace GG","Rouhollah Jalili","Dorna Esrafilzadeh","Maryam Salari","Zahra Gholamvand","Sima Aminorroaya Yamini","Konstantin Konstantinov","Roderick L.
