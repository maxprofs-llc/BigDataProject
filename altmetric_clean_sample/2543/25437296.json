Inhibition of DPP-IV may improve glycemic control in diabetics by preventing the rapid breakdown of incretin hormones and prolonging their physiological action. In this study, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) protein was hydrolyzed using animal proteolytic enzymes. The hydrolysate was purified sequentially by ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the fractions achieved from Antarctic krill protein was determined by DPP-IV screening reagent kit. Two purified peptides were identified by Xevo G2-XS QTof mass spectrometer (QTOF-MS). One peptide purified was Ala-Pro (AP) with IC50 values of 0.0530mg\/mL, the other Ile-Pro-Ala (IPA) with IC50 values of 0.0370mg\/mL. They both exhibited strong DPP-IV inhibitory activity. The molecular docking analysis revealed that DPP-IV inhibition by AP and IPA was mainly due to formation of a strong interaction surface force with the 91-96 and 101-105 amino acids of the DPP-IV. Our results suggested that the protein hydrolysate from Antarctic krill can be considered as a promising natural source of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides in the management of diabetes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf7","authors":["Wei Ji","Chaohua Zhang","Hongwu Ji"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jchromb.2017.09.001","first_seen_on":"2017-09-16T10:19:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["15700232","1873-376X"],"journal":"Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical & Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1505557144,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28915418?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28915418","pubdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Purification, identification and molecular mechanism of two dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides from Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) protein hydrolysate","type":"article","volume":"1064"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":7278480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108864,"mean":12.218965672451,"rank":89271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108864,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1155,"mean":2.0366949740035,"rank":872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1155,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":0.52,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sevragorgia\/statuses\/908998662918770689","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25437296],"posted_on":"2017-09-16T10:19:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Sergio Vargas","url":"https:\/\/sevragorgia.github.io","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/582565484748476416\/TLoAw8bU_normal.jpg","description":"Interested on the evolution of sponges and octocorals as well as on the study of symbiosis in these two groups.
