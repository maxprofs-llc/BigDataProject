Although great efforts were made to accomplish better cytoplasmic maturation by meiotic arrest maintenance (MAM) before in vitro maturation (IVM), limited progress has been achieved in various species. This study showed that MAM of porcine oocytes was better achieved with roscovitine than with dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (db-cAMP) or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Oocyte developmental competence after IVM was significantly improved following MAM in 199\u2009+\u2009FF medium (TCM-199 containing 10% porcine follicular fluid and 25\u2009\u00b5M roscovitine) to a level even higher than that in control oocytes matured without pre-MAM. Observations on other markers further confirmed the positive effects of MAM in 199\u2009+\u2009FF on oocyte cytoplasmic maturation. During MAM culture in 199\u2009+\u2009FF, re-decondensation (RDC) of condensed chromatin occurred, and transcription of genes beneficial to cytoplasmic maturation was evident in some of the oocytes with surrounded nucleoli (SN). However, MAM with db-cAMP neither induced RDC nor improved oocyte developmental potential. Together, the results suggest that MAM in the presence of FF and roscovitine improved the developmental competence of porcine oocytes by promoting a pre-GVBD chromatin de-condensation and expression of beneficial genes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Min Zhang","Chuan-Xin Zhang","Liu-Zhu Pan","Shuai Gong","Wei Cui","Hong-Jie Yuan","Wei-Ling Zhang","Jing-He Tan"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-11970-y","first_seen_on":"2017-09-16T10:29:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1505557761,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28912491"],"pmid":"28912491","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["science"],"title":"Meiotic arrest with roscovitine and follicular fluid improves cytoplasmic maturation of porcine oocytes by promoting chromatin de-condensation and gene transcription","type":"article","volume":"7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":7278481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108865,"mean":12.218857565403,"rank":89272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108865,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37619,"mean":14.728024190547,"rank":31250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37619,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2548,"mean":11.665202983903,"rank":1998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2548,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/meiosis_papers\/statuses\/909001252708556800","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25437980],"posted_on":"2017-09-16T10:29:21+00:00","author":{"name":"meiosispapers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/pmcarlton\/pubmed-rss-twitter","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/694039532400832512\/SSjYg2IY_normal.png","description":"Recent meiosis papers from pubmed RSS and bioR\u03c7iv.
