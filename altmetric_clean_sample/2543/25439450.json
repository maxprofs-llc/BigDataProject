As methods in nanomedicine advance, ethical questions conjunctly arise. Nanomedicine is an exceptional niche in several aspects as it reflects risks and uncertainties not encountered in other areas of medical research or practice. Nanomedicine partially overlaps, partially interlocks and partially exceeds other medical disciplines. Some interpreters agree that advances in nanotechnology may pose varied ethical challenges, whilst others argue that these challenges are not new and that nanotechnology basically echoes recurrent bioethical dilemmas. The purpose of this article is to discuss some of the ethical issues related to nanomedicine and to reflect on the question whether nanomedicine generates ethical challenges of new and unique nature. Such a determination should have implications on regulatory processes and professional conducts and protocols in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008146","authors":["Irit Allon","Ahmi Ben-Yehudah","Raz Dekel","Jan-Helge Solbakk","Klaus-Michael Weltring","Gil Siegal"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11019-016-9720-7","first_seen_on":"2017-09-16T10:54:01+00:00","issns":["1386-7423","1572-8633"],"journal":"Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy","last_mentioned_on":1505559229,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27522374?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27522374","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ethics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Law","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy of Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy of Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Theory of Medicine\/Bioethics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Ethical issues in nanomedicine: Tempest in a teapot?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethical-issues-nanomedicine-tempest-teapot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":7278481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108865,"mean":12.218885582011,"rank":89272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108865,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":310,"mean":4.3048349514563,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":310,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":5.5,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UvaScience_Pubs\/statuses\/909007409070317568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25439450],"posted_on":"2017-09-16T10:53:49+00:00","author":{"name":"UVA Science Pubs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/896110902629601282\/tXTVjDMj_normal.jpg","description":"This is a twitter account that posts up to 10 papers published on PubMed by scientists at the University of Virginia.","id_on_source":"UvaScience_Pubs","tweeter_id":"896108681225535489","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":7},"tweet_id":"909007409070317568"}]}}
