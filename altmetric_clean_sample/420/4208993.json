Some resolvases are encoded by replicative transposons and resolve the transposition product, in which the donor and recipient molecules are fused, into separate replicons. Other resolvases are encoded by plasmids and function to resolve plasmid dimers into monomers. Both types are therefore involved in the spread and maintenance of antibiotic-resistance genes. Resolvases and the closely related invertases were the first serine recombinases to be studied in detail, and much of our understanding of the unusual strand exchange mechanism of serine recombinases is owed to those early studies. Resolvases and invertases have also served as paradigms for understanding how DNA topology can be harnessed to regulate enzyme activity. Finally, their relatively modular structure, combined with a wealth of structural and biochemical data, has made them good choices for engineering chimeric recombinases with designer specificity. This chapter focuses on the current understanding of serine resolvases, with a focus on the contributions of structural studies.","authors":["Rice, Phoebe A"],"doi":"10.1128\/microbiolspec.mdna3-0045-2014","first_seen_on":"2015-06-25T10:31:51+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["2165-0497"],"issue":"2","journal":"Microbiology spectrum","last_mentioned_on":1458222547,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26104713?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26104713"],"pmid":"26104713","pubdate":"2015-06-25T22:04:03+00:00","title":"Serine Resolvases.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serine-resolvases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
