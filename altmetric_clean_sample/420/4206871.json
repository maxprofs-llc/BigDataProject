This paper describes the statistical model underlying the computer adaptive PNT presented in a companion paper (Hula, Kellough, and Fergadiotis, under review).\nUsing archival data, we evaluated fit of the PNT to 1- and 2-parameter logistic (1-PL, 2-PL) models and examined the precision of the resulting parameter estimates. We regressed the item difficulty estimates on three predictor variables: word length, age of acquisition, and contextual diversity.\nThe 2-PL model demonstrated marginally better fit, but 1-PL model fit was adequate. Precision was excellent for both person ability and item difficulty estimates. Word length, age of acquisition, and contextual diversity all independently contributed to variance in item difficulty.\nIRT methods can be productively used to analyze and quantify anomia severity in aphasia. Regression of item difficulty on lexical variables supported the validity of the PNT and interpretation of anomia severity scores in the context of current word finding models.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f2f","authors":["Gerasimos Fergadiotis","Stacey Kellough","William D.
