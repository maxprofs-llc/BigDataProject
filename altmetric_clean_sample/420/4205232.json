Existing drug treatments have limited efficacy in malaria elimination, and the complex pathogenesis of the disease is not fully understood. Detecting novel malaria-associated genes not only contributes in revealing the disease pathogenesis, but also facilitates discovering new targets for anti-malaria drugs.\nIn this study, we developed a network-based approach to predict malaria-associated genes. We constructed a cross-species network to integrate human-human, parasite-parasite and human-parasite protein interactions. Then we extended the random walk algorithm on this network, and used known malaria genes as the seeds to find novel candidate genes for malaria.\nWe validated our algorithms using 77 known malaria genes: 14 human genes and 63 parasite genes were ranked averagely within top 2% and top 4%, respectively among human and parasite genomes. We also evaluated our method for predicting novel malaria genes using a set of 27 genes with literature supporting evidence. Our approach ranked 12 genes within top 1% and 24 genes within top 5%. In addition, we demonstrated that top-ranked candied genes were enriched for drug targets, and identified commonalities underlying top-ranked malaria genes through pathway analysis. In summary, the candidate malaria-associated genes predicted by our data-driven approach have the potential to guide genetics-based anti-malaria drug discovery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Chen, Yang","Xu, Rong"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-16-s7-s9","first_seen_on":"2015-06-24T12:38:56+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"Suppl 7","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1435149455,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26099491?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26099491","pubdate":"2015-06-24T22:05:35+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"S9","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Network-based gene prediction for Plasmodium falciparum malaria towards genetics-based drug discovery.","type":"article","volume":"16 Suppl 7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/networkbased-gene-prediction-plasmodium-falciparum-malaria-towards-geneticsbased-drug-discovery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5273534,"mean":6.2055440464697,"rank":2797396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1790764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5273534,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186178,"mean":8.4789113048337,"rank":103018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":64911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186178,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4741,"mean":3.8288337552743,"rank":3046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4741,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236,"mean":4.8690893617021,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
