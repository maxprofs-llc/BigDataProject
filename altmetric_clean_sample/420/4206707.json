Sociodemographic variables, patient safety culture, intention to report errors, and coaching behavior were measured using self-report instruments. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient, the t test, and the Mann-Whitney U test.\nNurses' perceptions of patient safety culture and their intention to report errors showed significant differences between groups of nurses who rated their leaders as high-performing or low-performing coaches. Perceived coaching behavior showed a significant, positive correlation with patient safety culture and intention to report errors, i.e., as nurses' perceptions of coaching behaviors increased, so did their ratings of patient safety culture and error reporting.\nThere is a need in health care settings for coaching by nurse managers to provide quality nursing care and thus improve patient safety. Programs that are systematically developed and implemented to enhance the coaching behaviors of nurse managers are crucial to the improvement of patient safety and nursing care. Moreover, a systematic analysis of the causes of malpractice, as opposed to a focus on the punitive consequences of errors, could increase error reporting and therefore promote a culture in which a higher level of patient safety can thrive.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc8","authors":["Ko, YuKyung","Yu, Soyoung"],"doi":"10.1097\/pts.0000000000000224","first_seen_on":"2015-06-24T19:28:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-8417","1549-8425"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Patient Safety","last_mentioned_on":1504206692,"links":["http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/_layouts\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?article=99641&issue=00000&year=9000#ath","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/Abstract\/publishahead\/The_Relationships_Among_Perceived_Patients__Safety.99641.aspx","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/9000\/00000\/The_Relationships_Among_Perceived_Patients__Safety.99641.pdf","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/_layouts\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&issue=00000&article=99641#ath","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/Fulltext\/2017\/09000\/The_Relationships_Among_Perceived_Patients__Safety.10.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/Fulltext\/2017\/09000\/The_Relationships_Among_Perceived_Patients__Safety.10.aspx?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/9000\/00000\/The_Relationships_Among_Perceived_Patients__Safety.99641.pdf","pmid":"26101999","pubdate":"2015-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"175","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"The Relationships Among Perceived Patients' Safety Culture, Intention to Report Errors, and Leader Coaching Behavior of Nurses in Korea: A Pilot Study.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/Fulltext\/2017\/09000\/The_Relationships_Among_Perceived_Patients__Safety.10.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationships-among-perceived-patients-safety-culture-intention-report-errors-leader-coaching-behavi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":3376749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":5049783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230717,"mean":8.3497043638067,"rank":76758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":152537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230717,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":473,"mean":13.795207627119,"rank":226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":473,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":15.494108108108,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
