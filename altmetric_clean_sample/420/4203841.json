With these advancements, there is a growing interest in systems analysis of the cardiac signaling network because its dynamical property is closely associated with cardiac diseases. In this article, we review recent attempts at computational modeling of the cardiac signaling network and provide a system-level perspective on the analysis of the large-scale cardiac signaling network. We discuss why the systems biological approach is useful and what novel insights it can provide for the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for cardiac diseases in the post-genomic era.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002432","authors":["Jun Hyuk Kang","Ho-Sung Lee","Yun-Won Kang","Kwang-Hyun Cho"],"doi":"10.1093\/bib\/bbv039","first_seen_on":"2015-06-24T05:26:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-4054"],"issue":"3","journal":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1470681762,"links":["http:\/\/bib.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/23\/bib.bbv039.short?rss=1","http:\/\/bib.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/17\/3\/419.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bib.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/23\/bib.bbv039.full.pdf","pmid":"26108228","pubdate":"2015-06-26T22:04:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Computation Theory And Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Systems biological approaches to the cardiac signaling network","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systems-biological-approaches-cardiac-signaling-network-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":3739222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4362155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229432,"mean":8.3004637472705,"rank":96025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":129025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229432,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":715,"mean":6.0563109243698,"rank":454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":715,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":5.488358974359,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BioinfoPapers\/status\/613578660893732864","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4203841],"posted_on":"2015-06-24T05:25:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Bioinformatics paper","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/483512435718885376\/pgha5c6c_normal.png","description":"An up-to-date list of recent bioinformatics publications, for your convenience.","id_on_source":"BioinfoPapers","tweeter_id":"2565448514","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":166},"tweet_id":"613578660893732864"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BioinformaticsP\/statuses\/732844115243732993","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4203841],"posted_on":"2016-05-18T08:03:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Bioinformatics Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/440955574063095808\/W_lwtphJ_normal.png","description":"New papers from: Oxford Bioinformatics, Briefings in Bioinformatics, BMC Bioinformatics, SCFBM, PLOS CB, ACM\/IEEE.
