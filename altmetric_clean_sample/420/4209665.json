However, the genetic etiology for its pathogenesis remains elusive. It is known that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the development of tumor progression. Here we show that microRNA-9 (miR-9) is a potential oncogene upregulated in osteosarcoma cells. Knockdown of miR-9 in osteosarcoma resulted in suppressed colony formation and cell proliferation. Further study identified GCIP, a Grap2 and cyclin D interacting protein, as a direct target of miR- 9. In addition, GCIP overexpression activated retinoblastoma 1 (Rb) and suppressed E2F transcriptional target expression in osteosarcoma cells. Moreover, GCIP depletion reversed miR-9 knockdown induced colony formation and cell proliferation suppression. In sum, these results highlight the importance of miR-9 as an oncogene in regulating the proliferation of osteosarcoma by directly targeting GCIP and may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b68","authors":["Zhu, Shao-Wen","Li, Jian-Peng","Ma, Xin-Long","Ma, Jian-Xiong","Yang, Yang","Chen, Yang","Liu, Wei"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-25T13:26:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1513-7368"],"issue":"11","journal":"Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1435238764,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26107195?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26107195","pubdate":"2015-06-25T22:01:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"miR-9 Modulates Osteosarcoma Cell Growth by Targeting the GCIP Tumor Suppressor.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir9-modulates-osteosarcoma-cell-growth-targeting-gcip-tumor-suppressor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5276531,"mean":6.2120126170061,"rank":4394388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5276531,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186466,"mean":8.4671196632077,"rank":150746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186466,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1195,"mean":1.9630301507538,"rank":662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1195,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":0.6025,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
