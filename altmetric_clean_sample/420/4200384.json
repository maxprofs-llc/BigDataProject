Fatigue was measured at admission and discharge on the Schwartz Fatigue Scale from 7 (no fatigue) to 63 (worst fatigue) points. Quality of life and exercise capacity were also measured at admission and discharge. Length of admission and time to next hospital admission were recorded.\nAnalysed as the primary outcome, the experimental group had a greater rate of improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) than the control group, but this was not statistically significant (MD 0.13% predicted per day, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.28). However, the experimental group had a significantly higher FEV1 at discharge than the control group (MD 4.2% predicted, 95% CI 0.1 to 8.3). The experimental group reported significantly lower levels of fatigue on the Schwartz fatigue scale at discharge than the control group (MD 6 points, 95% CI 1 to 11). There was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in subjective symptom severity, quality of life, exercise capacity, length of hospital admission or time to next hospital admission.\nAmong people hospitalised for an acute exacerbation of cystic fibrosis, the use of non-invasive ventilation as an adjunct to the airway clearance regimen significantly improves FEV1 and fatigue.\nANZCTR 12605000437662.
