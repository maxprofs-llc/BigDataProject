HIV-2 remains an important cause of disease in West Africa. This study aimed to evaluate HIV-1 and HIV-2 prevalence among pregnant women and to describe the demographic and clinical profile of patients with HIV-2 infection from 2003-2013 at St Camille and General Lamizana Military Medical Centers. A retrospective investigation was conducted using 12,287 medical records from patients screened for HIV. To respond to the lack of data available regarding HIV-2 treatment and also to address the approach to clinical, biological as well as therapeutic monitoring, 62 HIV-2 infected patients' medical records were studied. Seroprevalence of 10.6 and 0.14% were obtained, respectively for HIV-1 and HIV-2 among 12,287 women screened during the study period. From the sixty two (62) HIV-2 patients, the average age was 49.2 years (sex ratio was 0.65). The weight loss and diarrhea were the major clinical manifestations observed, respectively 54.8 and 25.8%. Fungi and herpes zoster (shingles) infections were reported as major opportunistic infections. Also, nearly half of the patients had more than 60 kg, less than 2% were in WHO stage IV and about 2\/3 had a CD4 count bellow 250 cells mm(-3). AZT-3TC-IDV\/LPV\/R was the most prescribed combination. The gain in weight gain the Body Mass Index (BMI) improvement and the non-significant increase of the rate of CD4 between 1st (M1) and 24th month (M24) were observed after treatment with antiviral.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f610004384","authors":["Sanou, M","Soubeiga, S T","Bationo, F","Compaore, T R","Zohoncon, T M","Diatto, G N","Ouedraogo, P","Pietra, V","Nagalo, B M","Bisseye, C","Traore, R Ouedraogo","Simpore, J"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-23T12:16:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1028-8880"],"issue":"12","journal":"Pakistan Journal of Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1435061743,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26027168?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26027168","pubdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"A decade of follow-up and therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV-2 immunocompromised patients at St Camille and General Lamizana Military Medical Centers, Burkina Faso, West Africa.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decade-followup-therapeutic-drug-monitoring-hiv2-immunocompromised-patients-st-camille-general-lamiz"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5268528,"mean":6.2009945015013,"rank":3708693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":882301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5268528,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185424,"mean":8.5108490963906,"rank":129811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":35422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185424,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197,"mean":1.8495816326531,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
