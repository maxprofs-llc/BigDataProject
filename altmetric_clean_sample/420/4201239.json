Also, our aim was to estimate the required and received assistance for household chores. In an interview study via telephone, 124 patients with moderate-to-severe RA, visiting a tertiary-level dermatological clinic, listed spontaneously without predefined list the household chores and leisure-time activities that they considered were particularly affected by the RA. Ability to perform household chores and leisure-time activities were asked. The need for outside assistance with household chores and help received were also determined. Rheumatoid arthritis affected wide range of everyday household activities, with tasks related to cleaning of the house mentioned most often. Eleven of the categories out of 16 were similar to those included in the HAQ index. The majority of the patients (84.6\u00a0%) reported disadvantage in performing household chores because of RA. More than half of the patients (55.7\u00a0%) received assistance with household chores, women significantly more often than men (69.0 vs. 26.3\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Most of the household chores mentioned were physically demanding. Leisure-time activities listed by respondents as affected by RA were mostly related to sport. The majority of patients (77.2\u00a0%) had either reduced or completely given up at least one leisure-time activity. When estimating the total burden of the disease, the impact on both household chores and leisure-time activities should be taken into account.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000349a","authors":["Leino, Mauri","Tuominen, Sini","Piril\u00e4, Laura","Tuominen, Risto","Mauri Leino","Sini Tuominen","Laura Piril\u00e4","Risto Tuominen"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00296-015-3313-2","first_seen_on":"2015-06-23T14:24:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1437-160X","0172-8172"],"journal":"Rheumatology International","last_mentioned_on":1488325440,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26092613","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00296-015-3313-2"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00296-015-3313-2.pdf","pmid":"26092613","pubdate":"2015-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Effects of rheumatoid arthritis on household chores and leisure-time activities.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00296-015-3313-2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-rheumatoid-arthritis-household-chores-leisuretime-activities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":929449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7344445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229375,"mean":8.3479090829825,"rank":34831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":193960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229375,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":830,"mean":3.4556791314837,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":830,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.9911764705882,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
