Repeat ablation was preformed in 55% of patients with recurrent arrhythmia in the catheter group, and 24% in the surgery group, increasing the success rate to 39% and 53% respectively after one or more procedures. Predictors of success after the first procedure in a multivariable setting included higher baseline EF, and male gender. Persistent or long-standing AF, and log of AF duration were associated with lower success. Major complications occurred in 6% of the catheter ablation and 18% of the AF surgery groups. On follow-up, 16 patients died (9 in catheter and 7 in surgery group) and 1 underwent heart replacement. Lower baseline EF, and older age were independently associated with death.\nCatheter ablation and AF surgery are associated with symptomatic improvement in HCM patients. However, long-term success is lower and complications are higher than previously published.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007602","authors":["Bassiouny, Mohamed","Lindsay, Bruce D","Lever, Harry","Saliba, Walid","Klein, Allan","Banna, Moustafa","Abraham, JoEllyn","Shao, Mingyuan","Rickard, John","Kanj, Mohamed","Tchou, Patrick","Dresing, Thomas","Baranowski, Bryan","Bhargava, Mandeep","Callahan, Thomas","Tarakji, Khaldoun","Cantillon, Daniel","Hussein, Ayman","Marc Gillinov, A","Smedira, Nicholas G","Wazni, Oussama"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.hrthm.2015.03.042","first_seen_on":"2015-06-25T04:49:42+00:00","issns":["1556-3871","1547-5271"],"journal":"Heart Rhythm","last_mentioned_on":1435207763,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1547527115003410"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.heartrhythmjournal.com\/article\/S1547527115003410\/pdf","pmid":"25814420","pubdate":"2015-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Outcomes of nonpharmacologic treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-nonpharmacologic-treatment-atrial-fibrillation-patients-hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5276531,"mean":6.2120126170061,"rank":2800354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1790336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5276531,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186467,"mean":8.4670755955511,"rank":103129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":65024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186467,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":647,"mean":4.7985510835913,"rank":341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":647,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":3.1033333333333,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
