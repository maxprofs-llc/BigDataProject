Multilevel logistic regressions modelled the probability of GP providing space response, considering patient multimorbidity, deprivation conditions and other contextual factors. Further multinomial regressions explored the possible impact of multimorbidity and deprivation on expression of and specific responses to patients' emotional distress.\nIt was less likely for GPs to provide space as the consultation proceeded, controlling for multimorbidity and deprivation variables. Patients with multimorbidity were less likely to express emotional distress in an explicit form. GPs were more likely to provide acknowledgement to emotions expressed by patients from more deprived areas.\nMultimorbidity and deprivation may influence the dynamics of the GP consultations in specific ways. Rigorous methodologies using larger samples are required to explore further how these two variables relate to each other and influence cue expression, provider response and subsequent patient outcomes.\nUnderstanding how multimorbidity and deprivation impact on GP consultations may help inform future service improvement programmes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032a1","authors":["Zhou, Yuefang","Lundy, Jenna-Marie","Humphris, Gerry","Mercer, Stewart William","Yuefang Zhou","Jenna-Marie Lundy","Gerry Humphris","Stewart William Mercer"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pec.2015.05.026","endpage":"1070","first_seen_on":"2015-06-23T16:32:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0738-3991","07383991","1873-5134"],"issue":"9","journal":"Patient Education & Counseling","last_mentioned_on":1437211828,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0738399115002712","http:\/\/eprints.gla.ac.uk\/107580\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.pec.2015.05.026","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.pec.2015.05.026"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/article\/S0738399115002712\/pdf","pmid":"26111501","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1063","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Do multimorbidity and deprivation influence patients\u2019 emotional expressions and doctors\u2019 responses in primary care consultations? \u2013 An exploratory study using multilevel analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0738399115002712","volume":"98","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multimorbidity-deprivation-influence-patients-emotional-expressions-doctors-responses-primary-care-c-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5366929,"mean":6.2764892370478,"rank":902881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":4461282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5366929,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186646,"mean":8.5373318545904,"rank":40902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":145573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186646,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1147,"mean":4.0753141361257,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1147,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":5.0573770491803,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
