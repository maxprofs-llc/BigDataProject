There is recent interest in the development of tools for service prioritization, but none are specifically targeted to obstetrics. Therefore, the aim of this study was (i) to conduct a practice audit surveying the demographics of patients attending obstetrics wards at a high-capacity maternity hospital; and (ii) to evaluate a triage tool developed to prioritize pharmacy services.\nA retrospective case review of women discharged after birth admissions was undertaken at a hospital in National Health Service (NHS) Scotland during June 2014. Demographic and admission data were collected, as well as pharmacist interventions and missed opportunities in patient care on post-natal wards. A pharmacy triage tool was developed and retrospectively applied to each case to ascertain a risk category that would trigger and target pharmacist review. Interventions\/opportunities were classified as either clinical (medication related) or administrative (potential for error development).\nOne hundred and seventy-five cases were reviewed with a median age of 29\u00a0years old. Eighty-six patients (49\u00b71%) were retrospectively classified with elevated risk using the triage tool. A total of 117 charts (66\u00b79%) were identified with missed opportunities for pharmacist intervention, which was significantly greater among patients classified as higher risk (75\u00b76 vs. 58\u00b74%, P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7017). Compared to low-risk patients, patients with a higher-risk classification had lower rates of administrative missed opportunities (55\u00b74 vs. 80\u00b78%, P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7015), but numerically higher rates of clinical (26\u00b72 vs. 9\u00b76%, p=NS) and mixed clinical\/administrative (18\u00b75 vs. 9\u00b76%, p=NS) missed opportunities, although this failed to reach statistical significance.\nEvaluation of a triage tool for obstetric services demonstrated potential for prioritizing higher-risk patients for pharmacist review and addressing opportunities for clinical improvements.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d06","authors":["Covvey, J.
