The genetic testing plays an important role in the diagnosis of LQTS. A total of 15 genes have been reported for autosomal-dominant forms of Romano-Ward-type congenital LQTS and 2 genes for autosomal-recessive forms of the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in genetics of LQTS and briefly describe forward perspectives of LQTS investigation.Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 25 June 2015; doi:10.1038\/jhg.2015.74.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002de4","authors":["Yukiko Nakano","Wataru Shimizu"],"doi":"10.1038\/jhg.2015.74","endpage":"55","first_seen_on":"2015-06-25T14:13:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1435-232X","1434-5161"],"journal":"Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1491447674,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/jhg\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/jhg201574a.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/jhg.2015.74"],"pmid":"26108145","pubdate":"2015-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical research","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"51","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Genetics of long-QT syndrome","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetics-longqt-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":3.25,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":1650053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6330319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228702,"mean":8.1390049103416,"rank":56394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":171801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228702,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":838,"mean":5.5418972520908,"rank":301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":838,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":10.92737254902,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
