There are several types of epigenetic modifications to both DNA and histone proteins in eukaryotic cells; chiefly studied among these are changes to cytosine, where methylation of the 5-carbon position is the most prominent. Although this has many consequences for gene regulation and cell differentiation, other modifications have recently emerged as biologically relevant. Since global DNA methylation states may be used as a general measure of the methylome, cost-effective, rapid, and specific analytical tools are wanted.This protocol described here focuses on the Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA), a method which analyzes global DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) through the use of restriction enzymes and detection with Pyrosequencing(\u00ae). Up to 96 samples can be simultaneously analyzed. In contrast to the majority of other methods focused on 5mC analysis, with appropriate enzymes, LUMA does not appear to detect 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and is therefore more specific than most 5mC techniques.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Luttropp, Karin","Sj\u00f6holm, Louise K","Ekstr\u00f6m, Tomas J"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-2715-9_16","first_seen_on":"2015-06-25T10:19:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1435256224,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26103902?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26103902"],"pmid":"26103902","pubdate":"2015-06-25T22:04:59+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gene Function","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Global Analysis of DNA 5-Methylcytosine Using the Luminometric Methylation Assay, LUMA.","type":"article","volume":"1315"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5278180,"mean":6.2101388035557,"rank":2800614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1791904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5278180,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186468,"mean":8.4668568915681,"rank":103132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":65022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186468,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4134,"mean":1.4778190176627,"rank":1214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4134,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":2.7016496350365,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Brianxbio\/status\/614014957542207488","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4208885],"posted_on":"2015-06-25T10:19:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Ho","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Brianxbio","tweeter_id":"215282928","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":54},"tweet_id":"614014957542207488"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/status\/614135234410487809","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4208885],"posted_on":"2015-06-25T18:17:04+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
