The laryngofissure cut opened the larynx via the lateral aspect so that the anterior commissure was exposed. A needle was passed through the thyroid cartilage to reach the anterior commissure. The second needle was crossed over the first tracheal ring. The distance between the two needles was measured.\nThe mean distance between the anterior commissure of true vocal folds and the first tracheal ring was 26.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.28\u00a0mm (21.3-42.5\u00a0mm) in our subjects. This distance was 27.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.45 and 25.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0mm, in men and women, respectively. There was no statistically significant correlation between this distance with body mass index (BMI), age, and sex.\nThe distance between the anterior commissure and the first tracheal ring in patients with laryngotracheal pathologies helps in determining the best therapeutic plan for patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ada","authors":["Bakhshaee, Mehdi","Khadivi, Ehsan","Movahed, Rahman","Naserisadr, Masoud"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvoice.2015.04.004","first_seen_on":"2015-06-24T23:55:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4588"],"journal":"Journal of Voice","last_mentioned_on":1435190073,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26099432?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26099432","pubdate":"2015-06-25T22:08:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Performing Arts And Creative Writing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Evaluation of the Distance Between Anterior Commissure of True Vocal Folds and the First Tracheal Ring and Related Laryngeal Indices in 40 Human Cadavers.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-distance-between-anterior-commissure-true-vocal-folds-first-tracheal-ring-related-larynge"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5273534,"mean":6.2055440464697,"rank":2797378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1790761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5273534,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186177,"mean":8.4789077002408,"rank":103017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":64912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186177,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":549,"mean":2.1415510948905,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":549,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.7945384615385,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/status\/613857774955446272","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4207204],"posted_on":"2015-06-24T23:54:33+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":389},"tweet_id":"613857774955446272"}]}}
