In (I), the fused pyrrolidine rings adopt envelope conformations with the C atoms opposite the fused N-C bond as the flap in each ring, and their mean planes are inclined to one another by 52.8\u2005(3)\u00b0. In (II), the pyrrolidine and thia-zole rings are both twisted on the fused N-C bond, and their mean planes are inclined to one another by 70.8\u2005(2)\u00b0. In both (I) and (II), the furan ring adopts an envelope conformation with the adjacent C atom of the macrocycle as the flap. In the crystal of (I), mol-ecules are linked via C-H\u22efN and C-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds, forming sheets parallel to (10-1), while in (II), mol-ecules are linked via C-H\u22efN and C-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds, forming helical chains propagating along [010], which are linked via C-H\u22efS hydrogen bonds, forming slabs parallel to (001).","authors":["Viswanathan, V."],"doi":"10.1107\/s205698901501141x","endpage":"831","first_seen_on":"2015-06-25T00:01:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"7","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1435190405,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S205698901501141X="],"pmcid":"PMC4518911","pmid":"26279878","pubdate":"2015-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"827","title":"Crystal structures of two triazola-dioxola-benzena\u00adcyclo\u00adnona\u00adphanes","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structures-two-triazoladioxolabenzenacyclononaphanes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5273580,"mean":6.2055386742117,"rank":3712240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":883207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5273580,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186416,"mean":8.4631202102837,"rank":130380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":35731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186416,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15878,"mean":3.4135307677773,"rank":8895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15878,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":612,"mean":2.9586350245499,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":612,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystE\/status\/613859166973743104","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4207218],"posted_on":"2015-06-25T00:00:05+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"613859166973743104"}]}}
