Our study aimed to explore the association of TNF-\u03b1 polymorphisms and OS susceptibility in the Han Chinese population.\n80 OS patients and 99 healthy people, matched on the age and sex, participated in the study. Genotyping was conducted by the method of polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP). Then logistic regression was used to evaluate the effects of TNF-\u03b1 polymorphisms (-308G\/A and -238G\/A) on the pathology of OS.\nThe frequency of AA genotype in -308G\/A locus in the cases was significantly higher than that of the healthy group (20.0% vs. 6.1%). Patients with OS were more likely to possess AA genotype of -308G\/A locus (OR=4.00, 95% CI=1.41-11.38). For the patients with A allele, the risk for OS increased 0.62 fold (OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.04-2.50). There was no remarkable relationship of -238G\/A polymorphisms and OS susceptibility. In addition, we found that patients with G-A and A-A haplotypes was much higher in the cases than that of control group (68.0% and 25.0%, 53.0% and 38.9%, respectively). A-G haplotype appeared to increase the risk for OS (OR=1.93, 95% CI=1.13-2.94).\nThe AA genotype of -308G\/A locus of TNF-\u03b1 gene was a risk factor for OS, however there was no correlation between -238G\/A of TNF-\u03b1 and OS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc2b","authors":["Zhao, Zhongwei","Tang, Xiangyu","Song, Kai","Li, Xiang","Zhang, Yonggang"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-23T14:46:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-2625"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1435070716,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26097610?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26097610","pubdate":"2015-06-23T22:03:28+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Association of -308G\/A and -238G\/A polymorphisms of TNF-\u03b1 and osteosarcoma risk.","type":"article","volume":"8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5268528,"mean":6.2009945015013,"rank":4386250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5268528,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185423,"mean":8.5108509993422,"rank":150002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185423,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1220,"mean":0.9953486464315,"rank":658,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1220,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":1.0484,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/613357156201435136","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4201323],"posted_on":"2015-06-23T14:45:16+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
