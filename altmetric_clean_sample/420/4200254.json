They are a balancing part of an even more dynamic equilibrium of normalcy against daily assaults. PARP finds its companion candidates in other tumor suppressors, with the most prominent and glaring one being breast cancer (BRCA) 1 and 2. The strength of both is split by PARP inhibitors, inculcating the synthetic lethality of tumor cell, which is now in the market for ovarian cancer treatment. There are many reasons for the resistance of such inhibitors, which are now becoming clinically important. These are seen along with other damage repair approaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004116","authors":["Bose, Chinmoy K","Basu, Nirban"],"doi":"10.5152\/jtgga.2015.15029","first_seen_on":"2015-06-23T10:31:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1309-0399"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of the Turkish-German Gynecological Association","last_mentioned_on":1435054204,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26097394?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26097394","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"PARP inhibitors and more.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parp-inhibitors-more"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5268582,"mean":6.2010341536005,"rank":3708743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":882264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5268582,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185425,"mean":8.5108600936234,"rank":129811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":35418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185425,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.1203125,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"EC":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cancerSL\/status\/613287902701686784","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4200254],"posted_on":"2015-06-23T10:10:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Synthetic Lethality","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439039751878750209\/WmW-NwUf_normal.png","description":"Daily RSS feed for papers on Synthetic Lethality in Cancer. cancer AND (synthetic lethal OR synthetic lethality).
