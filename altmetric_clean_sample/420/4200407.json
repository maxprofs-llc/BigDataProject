Modification of the normal methylation pattern, unique to each organism, leads to the development of pathological processes and diseases, including cancer. Therefore, quantification of the DNA methylation and analysis of changes in the methylation pattern is very important from a practical point of view and can be used for diagnostic purposes, as well as monitoring of the treatment progress. In this paper we present a new method for quantification of 5-methyl-2'deoxycytidine (m(5)C) in the DNA. The technique is based on conversion of m(5)C into fluorescent 3,N(4)-etheno-5-methyl-2'deoxycytidine (\u03b5m(5)C) and its identification by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The assay was used to evaluate m(5)C concentration in DNA of calf thymus and peripheral blood of cows bred under different conditions. This approach can be applied for measuring of 5-methylcytosine in cellular DNA from different cells and tissues.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006827","authors":["Giel-Pietraszuk, Ma\u0142gorzata","Insi\u0144ska-Rak, Ma\u0142gorzata","Golczak, Anna","Sikorski, Marek","Barciszewska, Miros\u0142awa","Barciszewski, Jan"],"doi":"10.18388\/abp.2015_988","first_seen_on":"2015-06-23T11:00:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1734-154X"],"journal":"Acta Biochimica Polonica","last_mentioned_on":1435057235,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26098716?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26098716","pubdate":"2015-06-23T22:01:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Quantification of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine in the DNA.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantification-5methyl2deoxycytidine-dna"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5268582,"mean":6.2010341536005,"rank":4386360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5268582,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185424,"mean":8.510904645055,"rank":150007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185424,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234,"mean":1.5520686695279,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.65,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
