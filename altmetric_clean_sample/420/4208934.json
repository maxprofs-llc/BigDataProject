The plasmacytoid morphology can be found in a variety of other malignancies including carcinomas, plasma cell neoplasms, lymphoproliferative disorders, and sarcomas. The authors report a rare case of plasmacytoid amelanotic malignant melanoma in a 78-year-old man presenting with an enlarging palpable, erythematous mass on his left posterior shoulder. A fine needle aspirate showed atypical findings with single amelanotic cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, mono- and multi-nucleation with prominent nucleoli and intranuclear inclusions. Review of the excision and immunohistochemical analysis revealed the malignant plasmacytoid cells stained with vimentin, S-100, HMB-45, and other staining patterns consistent with melanoma. Initial evaluation was negative for other sites of disease. However, 4 months later, the patient was noted to have metastatic disease to his lungs and liver. Given that the tumor was noted to be BRAF V600R mutated, the patient was started on single agent dabrafenib. The plasmacytoid morphology can be found in a variety of malignancies. Melanoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any malignancy presenting with plasmacytoid features.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5323cf058f61000446e","authors":["Linda Kocovski","Anita Bane","Shangguo Tang","Samih Salama","Salem Alowami"],"doi":"10.4081\/rt.2015.5698","first_seen_on":"2015-06-25T10:23:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2036-3613","2036-3605"],"issue":"2","journal":"Rare Tumors","last_mentioned_on":1435227722,"links":["http:\/\/www.pagepress.org\/journals\/index.php\/rt\/article\/view\/5698"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pagepress.org\/journals\/index.php\/rt\/article\/download\/5698\/4695","pmid":"26266008","pubdate":"2015-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Amelanotic melanoma presenting with plasmacytoid morphology and BRAF V600 mutation","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amelanotic-melanoma-presenting-plasmacytoid-morphology-braf-v600-mutation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5276657,"mean":6.2118283841153,"rank":2800414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1790385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5276657,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186467,"mean":8.4664857614794,"rank":103125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":65024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186467,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":1.4323529411765,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.1071428571429,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
