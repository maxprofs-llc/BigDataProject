Qualitative and quantitative features of capillary networks, including capillary diameter and density, were compared with perfusion-labeled histological specimens from the same eccentricity. Twelve human donor eyes with no history of eye disease were used for histological comparisons.\nsvOCT was able to clearly distinguish the morphological features of the nerve fiber layer capillary network, the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer capillary network, the capillary network at the border of the inner plexiform layer and superficial boundary of the inner nuclear layer, and the capillary network at the boundary of the deep inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer. The morphological features of these networks were highly comparable to those in previous histological studies. There were no statistical differences in mean capillary diameter between svOCT images and histology for all networks other than the RGC capillary network. Capillary density measurements were significantly greater in svOCT images, except in the RGC capillary network.\nsvOCT has the capacity to provide histology-like anatomical information about human retinal capillary networks in vivo. It may have great potential as a research and diagnostic tool in the management of retinal vascular diseases. Further work is required to clarify the cause of some quantitative differences between svOCT and histology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a79","authors":["Tan, Priscilla Ern Zhi","Balaratnasingam, Chandrakumar","Xu, Jing","Mammo, Zaid","Han, Sherry X","Mackenzie, Paul","Kirker, Andrew W","Albiani, David","Merkur, Andrew B","Sarunic, Marinko V","Yu, Dao-Yi"],"doi":"10.1167\/iovs.14-15879","first_seen_on":"2015-06-23T12:08:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-5783"],"issue":"6","journal":"Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science","last_mentioned_on":1435061271,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26098464?dopt=Abstract#pubmed"],"pmid":"26098464","pubdate":"2015-06-23T22:01:43+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Quantitative Comparison of Retinal Capillary Images Derived By Speckle Variance Optical Coherence Tomography With Histology.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-comparison-retinal-capillary-images-derived-speckle-variance-optical-coherence-tomograp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5268582,"mean":6.2010341536005,"rank":4386359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5268582,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185424,"mean":8.5109046450549,"rank":150007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185424,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2217,"mean":2.3293059566787,"rank":1607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2217,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":1.4378392857143,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
