Her latest paper (1000 cell analysis)","Our new LC-MS platform: online digest+separation in open tubular 10 um ID columns. And videos, with elevator music!"],"citation":{"abstract":"A novel open tubular nanoproteomic platform featuring accelerated on-line protein digestion and high-resolution nano liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been developed. The platform features very narrow open tubular columns, and is hence particularly suited for limited sample amounts. For enzymatic digestion of proteins, samples are passed through a 20 \u00b5m inner diameter (ID) trypsin + endoproteinase Lys-C immobilized open tubular enzyme reactor (OTER). Resulting peptides are subsequently trapped on a monolithic pre-column and transferred on-line to a 10 \u00b5m ID porous layer open tubular (PLOT) liquid chromatography LC separation column. Wnt\/\u00df-catenein signaling pathway (Wnt-pathway) proteins of potentially diagnostic value were digested+detected in targeted-MS\/MS mode in small cell samples and tumor tissues within 120 minutes. For example, a potential biomarker Axin1 was identifiable in just 10 ng of sample (protein extract of \u223c1,000 HCT15 colon cancer cells). In comprehensive mode, the current OTER-PLOT set-up could be used to identify approximately 1500 proteins in HCT15 cells using a relatively short digestion+detection cycle (240 minutes), outperforming previously reported on-line digestion\/separation systems. The platform is fully automated utilizing common commercial instrumentation and parts, while the reactor and columns are simple to produce and have low carry-over. These initial results point to automated solutions for fast and very sensitive MS based proteomics, especially for samples of limited size.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Hanne Kolsrud Hustoft","Tore Vehus","Ole Kristian Brandtzaeg","Stefan Krauss","Tyge Greibrokk","Steven Ray Wilson","Elsa Lundanes"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0106881","first_seen_on":"2014-09-15T18:50:36+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1432901929,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/authors\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0106881","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0106881","http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/264746564_Open_tubular_lab-on-columnmass_spectrometry_for_targeted_proteomics_of_nanogram_sample_amounts","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25222838?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0106881"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0106881.pdf","pmid":"25222838","pubdate":"2014-09-15T07:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Open Tubular Lab-On-Column\/Mass Spectrometry for Targeted Proteomics of Nanogram Sample Amounts","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/open-tubular-laboncolumnmass-spectrometry-targeted-proteomics-nanogram-sample-amounts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6551568,"mean":6.0694288050471,"rank":2705756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3697072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6551568,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159131,"mean":8.3191246779365,"rank":67322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":86577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159131,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99523,"mean":9.8162609071362,"rank":47021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":48443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99523,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2519,"mean":17.3382025417,"rank":1380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2519,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
