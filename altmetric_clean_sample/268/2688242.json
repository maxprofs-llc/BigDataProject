Additional independent risk factors for poor health outcomes among many include diabetes, physical inactivity and physical dysfunction. Physical inactivity partly contributes to the accelerated deterioration of physical function in people in all stages of CKD, to levels that significantly impact on clinically and patient important outcomes such as morbidity, employment, quality of life (QoL) and ultimately survival. Ongoing research aims to determine the effectiveness and impact of exercise rehabilitation on reducing\/managing the risk of CVD, alleviating physical function limitations, preventing disability and enhancing QoL. Current research also aims to elucidate the mechanisms via which exercise therapy may contribute to clinically relevant benefits.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000572b","authors":["Koufaki P","Greenwood SA","Macdougall IC","Mercer TH"],"doi":"10.1891\/0739-6686.31.235","first_seen_on":"2014-09-16T17:43:11+00:00","issns":["0739-6686"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annual review of nursing research","last_mentioned_on":1410889344,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24894142?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24894142","pubdate":"2014-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Publishing Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Exercise therapy in individuals with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and synthesis of the research evidence.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exercise-therapy-individuals-chronic-kidney-disease-systematic-review-synthesis-research-evidence-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2294529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1620981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113615,"mean":8.2481035435776,"rank":55069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":46332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113615,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.7067058823529,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cardiactivist\/status\/511933130714783744","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2688242],"posted_on":"2014-09-16T17:42:24+00:00","author":{"name":"The Cardiactivist","url":"http:\/\/www.cardiactivist.com","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/416697121434128385\/bhSj9Arr_normal.jpeg","description":"The Cardiactivist promotes good health by sharing medical  news related to exercise.
