In the context of an inflamed tissue, extensive changes in gene expression occur in both parenchymal cells and infiltrating cells of the immune system. Recently, basic transcriptional mechanisms that control inflammation have been clarified at a genome scale, particularly in macrophages and conventional dendritic cells. The regulatory logic of distinct groups of inflammatory genes can be explained to some extent by identifiable sequence-encoded features of their chromatin organization, which impact on transcription factor (TF) accessibility and impose different requirements for gene activation. Moreover, it has become apparent that the interplay between TFs activated by inflammatory stimuli and master regulators exerts a crucial role in controlling cell-type-specific transcriptional outputs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f3b","authors":["Stephen T Smale","Gioacchino Natoli"],"doi":"10.1101\/cshperspect.a016261","first_seen_on":"2014-09-13T12:29:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-0264"],"journal":"Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology","last_mentioned_on":1410674855,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25213094?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25213094","pubdate":"2014-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Transcriptional Control of Inflammatory Responses.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptional-control-inflammatory-responses-10"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1919939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2544750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117113,"mean":8.130540798552,"rank":43800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":71733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117113,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":3.122941475827,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.9767368421053,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
