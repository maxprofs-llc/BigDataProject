However, the use of high-dose opioids has essentially replaced such procedures. Recognition of the limits of medical therapy to treat cancer pain effectively is growing, while conversely, in regions with limited access to pain medications, the importance of destructive surgical techniques is increasing. A critical evaluation of the evidence for destructive techniques is warranted, and the authors review current evidence underlying these procedures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d98","authors":["Raslan AM","Cetas JS","McCartney S","Burchiel KJ"],"doi":"10.3171\/2010.6.jns10119","first_seen_on":"2014-09-16T18:00:32+00:00","issns":["0022-3085"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1410886800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20690810"],"pmid":"20690810","pubdate":"2010-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Destructive procedures for control of cancer pain: the case for cordotomy.","type":"article","volume":"114","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/destructive-procedures-control-cancer-pain-case-cordotomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.528,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.528},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":849837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":4185835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129844,"mean":8.6676915967748,"rank":26893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":102950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129844,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1695,"mean":4.1257992916175,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":1520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1695,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":3.2682926829268,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":17,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":2,"ZA":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"The Role of Neurosurgical Interventions in Palliative Care","url":"http:\/\/www.pallimed.org\/2014\/09\/the-role-of-neurosurgical-interventions.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PallimedAPalliativeMedicineBlog+%28Pallimed%3A++A+Hospice+%26+Palliative+Medicine+Blog%29","citation_ids":[2158591,2688298,2688299,2688300],"posted_on":"2014-09-16T17:00:00+00:00","summary":"(In preparation for the 9\/17\/14 #hpm Tweetchat, guest host Dr. William Rosenberg summarizes a few of the neurosurgical interventions which may be useful in palliative care. - Ed.)There are three major ways that neurosurgery can alleviate pain:1.
