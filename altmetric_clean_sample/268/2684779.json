Several groups have implemented chromogenic-based and fluorescence-based protocols to detect microRNA expression in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical tissue specimens. These emerging robust and reproducible tissue slide-based assays are valid tools to bring about the clinical application of in situ microRNA detection for routine diagnostics. Here, I describe a fully automated fluorescence-based four-color multiplex assay for co-detection of a microRNA (e.g., let-7a, miR-10b, miR-21, miR-34a, miR-126, miR-145, miR-155, miR-205, miR-210), reference RNA (e.g., U6 snRNA, 18S rRNA), and protein markers (e.g., CD11b, CD20, CD45, collagen I, cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 19, smooth muscle actin, tubulin, vimentin) in FDA-approved Leica Bond-MAX staining station.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Lorenzo F Sempere","Sempere LF"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-1459-3_13","first_seen_on":"2014-09-15T16:33:13+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1940-6029","1064-3745"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1410798783,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25218384?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25218384","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Fully Automated Fluorescence-Based Four-Color Multiplex Assay for Co-detection of MicroRNA and Protein Biomarkers in Clinical Tissue Specimens.","type":"article","volume":"1211","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fully-automated-fluorescencebased-fourcolor-multiplex-assay-codetection-microrna-protein-biomarkers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4256174,"mean":5.1191184833717,"rank":3393539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":122530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4256174,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111895,"mean":8.2871201315531,"rank":89326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111895,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2873,"mean":1.543401810585,"rank":1780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2873,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.7032142857143,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
