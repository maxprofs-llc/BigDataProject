Herein, the authors explore the possible clinical relationship between these two common disorders of bone. In this retrospective study, the medical charts of 100 women aged 50 through 75 years who had undergone stapedectomy for otosclerosis were reviewed and the prevalence of osteoporosis in these women was noted. Similarly, the prevalence of osteoporosis was determined in a control group of 100 women aged 50 to 75 years with presbycusis. Fifteen of 100 women with otosclerosis had a concomitant diagnosis of osteoporosis as compared with four of 100 women with presbycusis, yielding a significant clinical association (p = 0.007) between otosclerosis and osteoporosis. This study suggests an association between otosclerosis and osteoporosis, providing impetus and justification for future prospective clinical studies and related research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e18","authors":["Clayton AE","Mikulec AA","Mikulec KH","Merchant SN","McKenna MJ"],"doi":"10.1258\/0022215041917790","first_seen_on":"2014-09-15T17:56:33+00:00","issns":["0022-2151"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Laryngology & Otology","last_mentioned_on":1435386231,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15453937"],"pmid":"15453937","pubdate":"2004-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Association between osteoporosis and otosclerosis in women.","type":"article","volume":"118","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-osteoporosis-otosclerosis-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5281557,"mean":6.213098453185,"rank":2151321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3118967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5281557,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138866,"mean":8.7008973607461,"rank":49975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":88562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138866,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":820,"mean":2.0549597069597,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":820,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.2833333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
