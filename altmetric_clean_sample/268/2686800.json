In this study, whole genome and\/or transcriptome sequencing was performed on 19 specimens of PCa, matched adjacent benign prostate tissues, matched blood specimens, and organ donor prostates. A set of novel fusion transcripts was discovered in PCa. Eight of these fusion transcripts were validated through multiple approaches. The occurrence of these fusion transcripts was then analyzed in 289 prostate samples from three institutes, with clinical follow-up ranging from 1 to 15 years. The analyses indicated that most patients [69 (91%) of 76] positive for any of these fusion transcripts (TRMT11-GRIK2, SLC45A2-AMACR, MTOR-TP53BP1, LRRC59-FLJ60017, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4-AC011523.2, MAN2A1-FER, and CCNH-C5orf30) experienced PCa recurrence, metastases, and\/or PCa-specific death after radical prostatectomy. These outcomes occurred in only 37% (58\/157) of patients without carrying those fusion transcripts. Three fusion transcripts occurred exclusively in PCa samples from patients who experienced recurrence or PCaerelated death. The formation of these fusion transcripts may be the result of genome recombination. A combination of these fusion transcripts in PCa with Gleason's grading or with nomogram significantly improves the prediction rate of PCa recurrence. Our analyses suggest that formation of these fusion transcripts may underlie the aggressive behavior of PCa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006988","authors":["Yu YP","Ding Y","Chen Z","Liu S","Michalopoulos A","Chen R","Gulzar ZG","Yang B","Cieply KM","Luvison A","Ren BG","Brooks JD","Jarrard D","Nelson JB","Michalopoulos GK","Tseng GC","Luo JH","Yan P.
