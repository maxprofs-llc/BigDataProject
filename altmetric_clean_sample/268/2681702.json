Among a sample of 338 heterosexual men, results indicated that MGRS mediated the relation between adherence to the status and antifemininity norms, but not the toughness norm, and HTW. Adherence to the toughness norm maintained a positive association with HTW. These findings suggest that men's HTW develops via multiple pathways that are associated with different norms of hegemonic masculinity. Implications for the prediction of men's aggression against women are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f8","authors":["Kathryn E. Gallagher","Dominic J.
