If at least 50% clinical improvement occurred, then the patient underwent a permanent SNM procedure. We evaluated the patients using a bladder diary, post-void residual volume measurement and the Wexner questionnaire score for constipation before the test phase, during the test phase and after the permanent SNM.Results:In the test phase, the rate of improvement in dysuria (29.4%) was significantly lower than urgency frequency (64.7%), urinary incontinence (69.2%) and constipation (75.0%). An implant was performed in 13 (56.5%) patients, including 4 patients who still used intermittent catheterization to exclude urine after permanent SNM because the symptom of dysuria could not be improved significantly and 1 patient who achieved \u2a7e50% improvement in lower urinary tract dysfunction but not in constipation. During follow-up (17.5\u00b12.0 months), 1 patient (7.7%) failed and 1 patient had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux.Conclusion:Chronic SNM cannot always resolve all the bladder and bowel symptoms secondary to spinal cord disease or injury, but combined with other treatments may help improve multiple symptoms.Spinal Cord advance online publication, 16 September 2014; doi:10.1038\/sc.2014.157.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a6","authors":["G Chen","L Liao"],"doi":"10.1038\/sc.2014.157","first_seen_on":"2014-09-16T15:31:22+00:00","issns":["1362-4393","1476-5624"],"journal":"Spinal Cord","last_mentioned_on":1427479203,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/sc\/rss\/aop\/~3\/Lc92j6HZMFY\/sc.2014.157","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/sc\/journal\/v53\/n3\/full\/sc2014157a.html?WT.mc_id=FBK_SC_1503_EDITORPICKMARCH_PORTFOLIO"],"pmid":"25224602","pubdate":"2014-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Spinal cord diseases","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Sacral neuromodulation for neurogenic bladder and bowel dysfunction with multiple symptoms secondary to spinal cord disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sacral-neuromodulation-neurogenic-bladder-bowel-dysfunction-multiple-symptoms-secondary-spinal-cord"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4927789,"mean":5.8496464709949,"rank":666379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4256984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4927789,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127024,"mean":8.6326711697883,"rank":21786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":105071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127024,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":651,"mean":5.0928307692308,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":651,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":7.02416,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"GB":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Sacral neuromodulation for neurogenic bladder and bowel dysfunction with multiple symptoms secondary to spinal cord disease","url":"http:\/\/www.bioportfolio.com\/news\/article\/2065834\/Sacral-neuromodulation-for-neurogenic-bladder-and-bowel-dysfunction-with-multiple-symptoms-secondary.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[2687742],"posted_on":"2014-09-16T13:08:01+00:00","summary":"","author":{"name":"Bioportfolio","url":"http:\/\/www.bioportfolio.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/821\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-12-11_at_16.36.54.png?1449851849"}}],"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10152886448768167&id=6115848166","license":"public","citation_ids":[2687742],"posted_on":"2015-03-27T18:00:03+00:00","summary":"Editor\u2019s Pick from Spinal Cord\n\nCheck out this special article in the March issue of Spinal Cord, as chosen by the editor of the journal: 'Sacral Neuromodulation for Neurogenic Bladder and Bowel Dysfunction with Multiple Symptoms Secondary to Spinal Cord D","author":{"name":"Nature","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/6115848166","facebook_wall_name":"Nature","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/6115848166\/picture","id_on_source":"6115848166"}}]}}
