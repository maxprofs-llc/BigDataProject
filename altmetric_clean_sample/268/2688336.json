Materials and Methods All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee and are in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Seven-month-old transgenic (TgCRND8) (Tg) mice and their nontransgenic (non-Tg) littermates were entered in the study. Mice were treated weekly with MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound in the bilateral hippocampus (1.68 MHz, 10-msec bursts, 1-Hz burst repetition frequency, 120-second total duration). After 1 month, spatial memory was tested in the Y maze with the novel arm prior to sacrifice and immunohistochemical analysis. The data were compared by using unpaired t tests and analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc analysis. Results Untreated Tg mice spent 61% less time than untreated non-Tg mice exploring the novel arm of the Y maze because of spatial memory impairments (P < .05). Following MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound, Tg mice spent 99% more time exploring the novel arm, performing as well as their non-Tg littermates. Changes in behavior were correlated with a reduction of the number and size of amyloid plaques in the MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound-treated animals (P < .01). Further, after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatment, there was a 250% increase in the number of newborn neurons in the hippocampus (P < .01). The newborn neurons had longer dendrites and more arborization after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound, as well (P < .01). Conclusion Repeated MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatments led to spatial memory improvement in a Tg mouse model of AD. The behavior changes may be mediated by decreased amyloid pathologic abnormalities and increased neuronal plasticity. \u00a9 RSNA, 2014.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086e2","authors":["Alison Burgess","Sonam Dubey","Sharon Yeung","Olivia Hough","Naomi Eterman","Isabelle Aubert","Kullervo Hynynen"],"doi":"10.1148\/radiol.14140245","endpage":"745","first_seen_on":"2014-09-16T18:06:43+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1527-1315","0033-8419"],"issue":"3","journal":"Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1493831123,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25222068?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/pubs.rsna.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1148\/radiol.14140245","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25222068","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1148\/radiol.14140245","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4314115\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25222068"],"pmid":"25222068","pubdate":"2014-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Radiological Society of North America","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"736","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Alzheimer Disease in a Mouse Model: MR Imaging\u2013guided Focused Ultrasound Targeted to the Hippocampus Opens the Blood-Brain Barrier and Improves Pathologic Abnormalities and Behavior","type":"article","volume":"273","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alzheimer-disease-mouse-model-mr-imagingguided-focused-ultrasound-targeted-hippocampus-opens-bloodbr-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":41.024,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":4,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":41.024},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150286,"mean":6.9044882123689,"rank":215623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7934679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150286,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183752,"mean":7.9286843500174,"rank":6383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":177369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183752,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3192,"mean":12.454888122846,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":3051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3192,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":17.218571428571,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
