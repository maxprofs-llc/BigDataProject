Clinical evidence indicates that metabolism of CYP2D6 substrates is increased during pregnancy, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To identify transcription factors potentially responsible for CYP2D6 induction during pregnancy, a panel of genes differentially expressed in the livers of pregnant vs. nonpregnant CYP2D6-humanized (tg-CYP2D6) mice was compiled via microarray experiments followed by qRT-PCR verification. As a result, seven transcription factors (ATF5, EGR1, FOXA3, JUNB, KLF9, KLF10, and REV-ERB\u03b1) were found to be upregulated during pregnancy. Results from transient transfection and promoter reporter gene assays indicate that KLF9 itself is a weak transactivator of CYP2D6 promoter but significantly enhances CYP2D6 promoter transactivation by HNF4\u03b1, a known transcriptional activator of CYP2D6 expression. The results from deletion and mutation analysis of CYP2D6 promoter activity identified a KLF9 putative binding motif at -22\/-14 region to be critical in the potentiation of HNF4\u03b1-induced transactivation of CYP2D6. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a direct binding of KLF9 to the putative KLF binding motif. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed increased recruitment of KLF9 to CYP2D6 promoter in the livers of tg-CYP2D6 mice during pregnancy. Taken together, our data suggest that increased KLF9 expression is in part responsible for CYP2D6 induction during pregnancy via the potentiation of HNF4\u03b1 transactivation of CYP2D6.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e7","authors":["Kwi Hye Koh","Xian Pan","Wei Zhang","Alan McLachlan","Raul Urrutia","Hyunyoung Jeong"],"doi":"10.1124\/mol.114.093666","first_seen_on":"2014-09-14T10:32:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-0111"],"journal":"Molecular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1423848845,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25217496?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/molpharm.aspetjournals.org\/content\/86\/6\/727.full"],"pmid":"25217496","pubdate":"2014-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Kruppel-like Factor 9 (KLF9) Promotes Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 Expression during Pregnancy in CYP2D6-humanized Mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kruppellike-factor-9-promotes-hepatic-cytochrome-p450-2d6-expression-during-pregnancy-cyp2d6humanize"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4755595,"mean":5.7068799069093,"rank":3368251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":775747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4755595,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124945,"mean":8.6188970738892,"rank":84876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":24809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124945,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":993,"mean":3.0308951612903,"rank":830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":993,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.2404761904762,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
