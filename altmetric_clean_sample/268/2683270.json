HP1\u03b3 has multiple phosphorylation sites, including serine 83 (S83) that marks it to sites of active transcription. In a guinea pig model for Shigella enterocolitis, we observed that the defective type III secretion mxiD Shigella flexneri strain caused more HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation in the colon than the wild-type strain. Shigella interferes with HP1 phosphorylation by injecting the phospholyase OspF. This effector interacts with HP1\u03b3 and alters its phosphorylation at S83 by inactivating ERK and consequently MSK1, a downstream kinase. MSK1 that here arises as a novel HP1\u03b3 kinase, phosphorylates HP1\u03b3 at S83 in the context of an MSK1-HP1\u03b3 complex, and thereby favors its accumulation on its target genes. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that this mechanism is linked to up-regulation of proliferative gene and fine-tuning of immune gene expression. Thus, in addition to histones, bacteria control host transcription by modulating the activity of HP1 proteins, with potential implications in transcriptional reprogramming at the mucosal barrier.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Habiba Harouz","Christophe Rachez","Benoit M Meijer","Benoit Marteyn","Fran\u00e7oise Donnadieu","Florence Cammas","Christian Muchardt","Philippe Sansonetti","Laurence Arbibe"],"doi":"10.15252\/embj.201489244","first_seen_on":"2014-09-15T02:59:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-2075"],"journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1416324431,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25216677?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/content\/early\/2014\/09\/12\/embj.201489244","http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/content\/33\/22\/2606?etoc=","http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/33\/22\/2606?rss=1"],"pmid":"25216677","pubdate":"2014-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Shigella flexneri targets the HP1\u03b3 subcode through the phosphothreonine lyase OspF","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shigella-flexneri-targets-hp1-subcode-through-phosphothreonine-lyase-ospf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4522755,"mean":5.2848280542506,"rank":381734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4137894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4522755,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117452,"mean":8.4568854756452,"rank":14435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":102857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117452,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4286,"mean":3.5069516919487,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4286,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":13.4275,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
