Interlink between Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) at the blood brain barrier (BBB) has raised hope toward a new disease modifying therapy in AD. Pgp is a major efflux transporter for beta amyloid (A[Formula: see text]) at human BBB. A literature survey reveals diminished expression of Pgp transporter at the BBB in AD patients. Pregnane X Receptor is a major transcriptional regulator of Pgp. Restoration of Pgp at the BBB enhances the elimination of the A[Formula: see text] from brain alongside and inhibits the apical to basolateral movement of A[Formula: see text] from the circulatory blood. This review concentrates on in vitro, in vivo, and in silico advancements on the study of the PXR in context to Pgp and discusses the substrate and inhibitor specificity between PXR and Pgp.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e4","authors":["Sumit Jain","Vijay Rathod","Rameshwar Prajapati","Prajwal P Nandekar","Abhay T Sangamwar"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11030-014-9550-6","first_seen_on":"2014-09-13T10:18:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-501X"],"journal":"Molecular Diversity","last_mentioned_on":1435267894,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25213397?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25213397?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25213397","pubdate":"2014-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Pregnane X Receptor and P-glycoprotein: a connexion for Alzheimer's disease management.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pregnane-x-receptor-pglycoprotein-connexion-alzheimers-disease-management-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561630,"mean":6.0798051118097,"rank":2435900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4027320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561630,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159127,"mean":8.2762219373329,"rank":57983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":97900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159127,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.4783018867925,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
