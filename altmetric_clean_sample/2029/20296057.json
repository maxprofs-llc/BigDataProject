Genomic expression profiling aids clinical decision-making in most patients, because most are estrogen receptor-positive. The commercially available classifiers are prognostic for distant recurrence in node-negative and also node-positive patients. Patients at genomically low risk have excellent 5-year outcomes with endocrine therapy alone. Some assays also predict for benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemotherapy in node-negative and node-positive patients, but with varying levels of evidence. Genomic classifiers are also prognostic of late relapse and may predict benefit from extended adjuvant endocrine therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007eda","authors":["Schwartzberg, Lee S"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-19T10:15:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1540-1413"],"issue":"5S","journal":"Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (JNCCN)","last_mentioned_on":1495188883,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28515241?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28515241","pubdate":"2017-05-19T22:08:07+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Use of Biomarkers and Multigene Assays in Breast Cancer.","type":"article","volume":"15"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":7121596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233772,"mean":12.348685243251,"rank":190195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233772,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":528,"mean":8.8553244781784,"rank":446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":528,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":27.481644444444,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/865511023532359680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20296057],"posted_on":"2017-05-19T10:14:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":714},"tweet_id":"865511023532359680"}]}}
