We exploited these assays to show that IRAK4 was constitutively active and that its intrinsic activity towards Pellino1 was not increased significantly by stimulation with interleukin-1 (IL-1) in IL-1R-expressing HEK293 cells, Pam3Csk4-stimulated human THP1 monocytes or primary human macrophages. Our results, in conjunction with those of other investigators, suggest that the IL-1-stimulated trans-autophosphorylation of IRAK4 is initiated by the MyD88-induced dimerisation of IRAK4 and is not caused by an increase in the intrinsic catalytic activity of IRAK4. In contrast to IRAK4, we found that IRAK1 was inactive in unstimulated cells and converted to an active protein kinase in response to IL-1 or Pam3Csk4 in human cells. Surprisingly, the IL-1-stimulated activation of IRAK1 was not affected by pharmacological inhibition of IRAK4 and not reversed by dephosphorylation and\/or deubiquitylation, suggesting that IRAK1 catalytic activity is not triggered by a covalent modification but by an allosteric mechanism induced by its interaction with IRAK4.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["Vollmer, Stefan","Strickson, Sam","Zhang, Tinghu","Gray, Nathanael","Lee, Katherine","Rao, Vikram","Cohen, Philip","Stefan Vollmer","Sam Strickson","Tinghu Zhang","Nathanael Gray","Katherine Lee","Vikram Rao","Philip Cohen"],"doi":"10.1042\/bcj20170097","first_seen_on":"2017-05-19T06:14:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0264-6021","1470-8728"],"journal":"Biochemical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1496608698,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28512203?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28512203\/"],"pmid":"28512203","pubdate":"2017-05-19T22:15:21+00:00","publisher":"Portland Press Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The mechanism of activation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 by interleukin-1 and Toll-Like receptor agonists","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanism-activation-irak1-irak4-interleukin1-tolllike-receptor-agonists"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":4187791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3916337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241091,"mean":12.418485553113,"rank":121338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":109630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241091,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4993,"mean":2.8789142628205,"rank":3451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4993,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":3.7217333333333,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TumorImm_papers\/statuses\/865450604079988736","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20291967],"posted_on":"2017-05-19T06:14:37+00:00","author":{"name":"TumorImmunoPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/741322452093931520\/rQvFtFTA_normal.jpg","description":"A TwitterBot for Cancer Immunology and Tolerance papers on #PubMed.
