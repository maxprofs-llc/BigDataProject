Here, we briefly review the key processes in the development of CAV during heart transplantation and highlight the roles of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in these processes during heart transplantation. Understanding the roles of TRP channels in contributing to the key procedures for the development of CAV during heart transplantation could provide basic scientific knowledge for the development of new preventive and therapeutic approaches to manage patients with CAV after heart transplantation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd13","authors":["Ma, Shuo","Jiang, Yue","Huang, Weiting","Li, Xintao","Li, Shuzhuang"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-19T10:18:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1643-3750"],"journal":"Medical science monitor international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","last_mentioned_on":1495189036,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28516902?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28516902","pubdate":"2017-05-19T22:04:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Role of Transient Receptor Potential Channels in Heart Transplantation: A Potential Novel Therapeutic Target for Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy.","type":"article","volume":"23"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":7121595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233772,"mean":12.348683104405,"rank":190194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233772,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1015,"mean":2.8144792899408,"rank":678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1015,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":2.1191304347826,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/trp_papers\/statuses\/865511668570144769","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20296211],"posted_on":"2017-05-19T10:17:16+00:00","author":{"name":"trppapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"trp_papers","tweeter_id":"4731026308","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":46},"tweet_id":"865511668570144769"}]}}
