Here we report the effects of the 1998 bleaching event on coral calcification as well as the composition of the calcifying fluid (cf) from which corals precipitate their calcium carbonate skeletons. This was investigated by using the Sr\/Ca, Li\/Mg (temperature), and boron isotopes (\u03b4(11)B) and B\/Ca (carbonate chemistry) proxies in a Porites sp. coral. Following the summer of 1998 the coral exhibited a prolonged period (~18 months) of reduced calcification (~60%) and a breakdown in the seasonality of the geochemical proxies. However, the maintenance of elevated dissolved inorganic carbon (DICcf; >\u00d72 seawater)\u00a0and pHcf (>8.3 compared to seawater ~8.0) even during severe stress of 1998 indicate that a minimum threshold of high aragonite saturation state (\u03a9cf) of ~14 (~\u00d74 seawater), is an essential pre-requisite for coral calcification. However, despite maintaining elevated levels of \u03a9cf even under severe stress, coral growth is still impaired. We attribute this to reductions in either the effective active volume of calcification and\/or DICcf as bleaching compromises the photosynthetically fixed carbon pool available to the coral.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["J.
