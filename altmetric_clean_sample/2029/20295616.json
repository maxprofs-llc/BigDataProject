The emergence of drug-resistance mechanisms, especially among bacteria, threatens the efficacy of all current antimicrobial agents, some of them already ineffective. As a result, there is an urgent need for new antimicrobial drugs. Host defense antimicrobial peptides (HDPs) are natural occurring and well-conserved peptides of innate immunity, broadly active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, viruses and fungi. They also are able to exert immunomodulatory and adjuvant functions by acting as chemotactic for immune cells, and inducing cytokines and chemokines secretion. Moreover, they show low propensity to elicit microbial adaptation, probably because of their non-specific mechanism of action, and are able to neutralize exotoxins and endotoxins. HDPs have the potential to be a great source of novel antimicrobial agents. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the advances made in the development of human defensins as well as the cathelicidin LL-37 and their derivatives as antimicrobial agents against bacteria, viruses and fungi for clinical use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c5","authors":["Pach\u00f3n-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Mar\u00eda Eugenia","Smani, Younes","Pach\u00f3n, Jer\u00f3nimo","S\u00e1nchez-C\u00e9spedes, Javier"],"doi":"10.1093\/femsre\/fux012","first_seen_on":"2017-05-19T10:03:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1574-6976","0168-6445"],"issue":"3","journal":"FEMS Microbiology Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1500350539,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28521337?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28521337?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/femsre\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/femsre\/fux012","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/femsre\/article\/41\/3\/323\/3830264\/Perspectives-for-clinical-use-of-engineered-human#.WW2IMYgdLDg.twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/femsre\/article-pdf\/41\/3\/323\/17171263\/fux012.pdf","pmid":"28521337","pubdate":"2017-05-19T22:00:15+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"OUP accepted manuscript","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perspectives-clinical-engineered-human-host-defense-antimicrobial-peptides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":2.85,"3m":1.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":3235203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4958603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233773,"mean":12.348549860548,"rank":80749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":151408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233773,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":486,"mean":6.9469567010309,"rank":335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":486,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":13.344705882353,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
