The axillary-iliac AVG was first reported in 1987, and few authors have explored this access. We evaluated our experience with this AVG configuration utilizing the early cannulation (EC) graft Flixene\u2122 (Atrium \u2122, Hudson, NH, USA). Eight patients (75\u00a0% men; mean age 37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0years) with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) underwent axillo-iliac AVG creation with Flixene\u2122 grafts; all had exhausted peripheral veins, occluded thoracic central veins, and inadequate femoral veins. Inflow from the axillary artery and outflow in iliocaval system was assessed prior to access creation. An axillary-to-common iliac AVG was constructed using a 6\u00a0mm (mm) EC graft and tunneled in the chest and abdominal wall. Eight grafts were implanted; all were patent after placement. Seven (88\u00a0%) were successfully used for hemodialysis within 72\u00a0h and one (12\u00a0%) within 96. During the mean follow-up of 6\u00a0months, 5 (62\u00a0%) patients underwent thrombectomy, 1 (12\u00a0%) of them had balloon angioplasty at the vein anastomosis, and 2 (25\u00a0%) grafts were removed secondary to infection. The remaining grafts are still functioning. Complications as high-output heart failure, steal syndrome and venous hypertension were not observed. Construction of axillo-iliac AVG with EC grafts in the setting of exhausted veins, occluded intrathoracic central veins and hostile groins, is a viable arteriovenous access alternative while avoiding central venous catheters.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b7b","authors":["Carlos A.
