It is not known, however, if this is a localised or generalised phenomenon. In the present study, levels of AEA, related N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) and linoleic acid-derived oxylipins have been measured in the blood of 26 healthy women and 38 women with migraine (26 with aura, 12 without aura) who were matched for age and body-mass index. Blood samples were taken on two occasions: the first sample near the start of the menstrual cycle (when present) and the second approximately fourteen days later. For a subset of migraine patients, two additional blood samples were taken, one during a migraine attack and one approximately 1 month later (to be at the same stage in the menstrual cycle, when present). NAEs and oxylipins were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Twenty-nine lipids were quantified, of which 16 were found to have a high reproducibility of measurement. There were no significant differences in the levels of AEA, the related NAEs stearoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamide or any of the nine linoleic acid-derived oxylipins measured either between migraine patients with vs. without aura, or between controls and migraine patients (after stratification to take into account whether or not the individuals had regular menstruation cycles) in either of the first two samples. Levels of linoleoylethanolamide were lower in the patients with vs. without aura on the second sample but not in the first sample, but the biological importance of this finding is unclear. Due to time-dependent increases in their concentrations ex vivo prior to centrifugation, AEA and oleoylethanolamide levels in the samples collected during migraine attacks were not analysed, but for the other fourteen lipids, there were no significant differences in plasma concentrations during migraine vs. one month later. It is concluded that migraine is not associated with a generalised (as opposed to localised) deficiency in these lipids.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008641","authors":["Sandra Gouveia-Figueira","Kristina Goldin","Sanaz A.
