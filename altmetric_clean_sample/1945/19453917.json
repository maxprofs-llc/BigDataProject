This study is a preliminary investigation of the expression in sporadic VIII CN schwannomas of Yes-associated protein (YAP), transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), and amphiregulin (AREG), a direct target gene of YAP and TAZ. The expression of YAP, TAZ and AREG was correlated with the volumetric dimensions of tumors on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (ceMRI).\nYAP, TAZ and AREG expression was assessed immunohistochemically in surgical specimens of 36 consecutive sporadic VIII CN schwannomas. 3D reconstructions of the tumors and their corresponding volumes in cm3 were obtained from measurements on ceMRI images using the OsiriX\u00ae software.\nWe found a significant direct correlation between TAZ expression and VIII CN schwannoma volumes on latest preoperative ceMRI (p<0.0003). Mean TAZ expression was also significantly higher in VIII CN schwannomas with a volume \u22652.1 cm3 than in those with a volume <2.1 cm3(p<0.0018). No significant correlations emerged for YAP or AREG expression and VIII CN schwannoma volume.\nThe immunohistochemical expression of TAZ (but not YAP or AREG) correlated significantly with schwannoma volume measured on ceMRI. Further investigations are needed to identify the biological factors influencing tumor proliferation (ideally secreted proteins like AREG) that might be detected using non-invasive approaches (i.e., blood samples).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007826","authors":["Martini, Alessandro","Marioni, Gino","Zanoletti, Elisabetta","Cappellesso, Rocco","Stramare, Roberto","Fasanaro, Elena","Faccioli, Chiara","Giacomelli, Luciano","Denaro, Luca","D\u2019Avella, Domenico","Mazzoni, Antonio","Fassina, Ambrogio"],"doi":"10.5301\/ijbm.5000263","first_seen_on":"2017-04-22T14:14:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0393-6155","1724-6008"],"journal":"International Journal of Biological Markers","last_mentioned_on":1492870444,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28430338?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28430338","pubdate":"2017-04-22T22:03:08+00:00","publisher":"Wichtig Publishing, SRL","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","biochemistry"],"title":"YAP, TAZ and AREG expression in eighth cranial nerve schwannoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/yap-taz-areg-expression-eighth-cranial-nerve-schwannoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088698,"mean":6.8825438942685,"rank":7002889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088698,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233078,"mean":12.761077575222,"rank":189769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233078,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":5.1988910891089,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
