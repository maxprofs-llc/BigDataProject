Reactive oxygen species resulting from xenobiotic and endogenous metabolites are sensed by a poorly understood process, triggering a cascade of regulatory factors and leading to the activation of the transcription factor Nrf2 (SKN-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans). Nrf2\/SKN-1 activation promotes the induction of the Phase II detoxification system that serves to limit oxidative stress. We have extended a previous C. elegans genetic approach to explore the mechanisms by which a Phase II enzyme is induced by endogenous and exogenous oxidants. The xrep ( xenobiotics response pathway) mutants were isolated as defective in their ability to regulate properly the induction of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) reporter. The xrep-1 gene was previously identified as wdr-23, which encodes a C. elegans homolog of the mammalian \u00df-propeller repeat-containing protein WDR-23. Here, we identify and confirm the mutations in xrep-2, xrep-3, and xrep-4 The xrep-2 gene is alh-6, an ortholog of a human gene mutated in familial hyperprolinemia. The xrep-3 mutation is a gain-of-function allele of skn-1 The xrep-4 gene is F46F11.6, which encodes a F-box-containing protein. We demonstrate that xrep-4 alters the stability of WDR-23 (xrep-1), a key regulator of SKN-1 (xrep-3). Epistatic relationships among the xrep mutants and their interacting partners allow us to propose an ordered genetic pathway by which endogenous and exogenous stressors induce the Phase II detoxification response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002942","authors":["Tetsunari Fukushige","Harold E.
