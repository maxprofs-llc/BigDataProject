We report the case of a 66-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain, blood in the stool, fever and chills. Laboratory tests were significant for leukocytosis and microcytic anemia. Abdominal imaging revealed a right colon mass and aortitis. Colonoscopy confirmed the right colon mass and also discovered a rectal mass, both adenocarcinomas. Treatment consisted of antibiotics, aortic repair, right hemi-colectomy and later trans-anal excision of the rectal mass. Blood cultures and the aortic specimen grew C. septicum. The patient improved and was doing well in follow up.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a1e","authors":["Deepanshu Jain"],"doi":"10.20524\/aog.2017.0140","first_seen_on":"2017-06-30T10:06:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["17927463","1108-7471"],"issue":"4","journal":"Annals of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1498817166,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28655990?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5480006","pmid":"28655990","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Clostridium septicum aortitis with synchronous ascending colon and rectal adenocarcinoma","type":"article","volume":"30"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236730,"mean":12.99389845773,"rank":194181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236730,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":6.3798024691358,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/880729147382702080","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21436125],"posted_on":"2017-06-30T10:06:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"880729147382702080"}]}}
