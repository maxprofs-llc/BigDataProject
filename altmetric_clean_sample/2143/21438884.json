IHR and PHR following open and laparoscopic rectal cancer resection have only been sparingly evaluated.\nPatients who underwent rectal cancer resection were identified in the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group's database. To identify IHR and PHR following rectal cancer resection, we linked data to the Danish Ventral Hernia Database. The absolute risk of IHR and PHR was estimated as cumulative incidence proportions, treating death as competing risk. We used Cox proportional hazard regression analysis with multivariable adjustment to compute hazard ratios (HRs) comparing open and laparoscopic approach.\nThe 5-year risk of IHR was 4.1% among patients undergoing open resection (n\u00a0=\u00a03090) and 3.2% among those undergoing laparoscopic resection (n\u00a0=\u00a03099), corresponding to a risk difference of 0.9% (95% CI 0.0-2.0, P\u00a0=\u00a00.057). Laparoscopic rectal resection was not associated with lower risk of IHR (adjusted HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.67-1.31, P\u00a0=\u00a00.709). A total of 2577 patients had a colostomy at rectal cancer resection and the 5-year risk of PHR was 2.1% after open surgery compared with 6.7% after laparoscopic surgery, corresponding to a risk difference of -4.6% (95% CI -6.4 to -2.7, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Laparoscopic surgery was associated with increased risk of PHR (adjusted HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.53-4.29, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nWe observed no association between surgical approach of rectal cancer resection and subsequent IHR. Laparoscopic surgery was associated with increased risk of PHR.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035f7","authors":["Andersen, Peter","Erichsen, Rune","Fr\u00f8slev, Trine","Madsen, Mogens R.","Laurberg, S\u00f8ren","Iversen, Lene H."],"doi":"10.1007\/s00464-017-5648-0","first_seen_on":"2017-06-30T12:20:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0930-2794","1432-2218"],"journal":"Surgical Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1498825201,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28643055"],"pmid":"28643055","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Open versus laparoscopic rectal cancer resection and risk of subsequent incisional hernia repair and paracolostomy hernia repair: a nationwide population-based cohort study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/open-versus-laparoscopic-rectal-cancer-resection-risk-subsequent-incisional-hernia-repair-paracolost"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":4513214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2352892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236730,"mean":12.993882828044,"rank":132325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":82395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236730,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3345,"mean":2.7818738038277,"rank":1655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3345,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":6.4281818181818,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/coboma_ltd\/statuses\/880762848514682880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21438884],"posted_on":"2017-06-30T12:20:01+00:00","author":{"name":"coboma ltd.","url":"http:\/\/www.coboma.ltd","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/849219400913887232\/bwtflkX-_normal.jpg","description":"coboma ltd. is a consultancy for Strategic Sales & Marketing and Bus.
