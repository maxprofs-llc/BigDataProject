Previously, by analyzing cells in exponential growth phase, we selected an indigenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine strain, namely CD-6Sc, for its higher tolerance to desiccation and higher expression of specific desiccation stress-related genes in comparison to other yeast strains. In this study, we performed a desiccation treatment on stationary phase cells by comparing the efficacy of two different methods: a \"laboratory dry test\" in a small-scale (mild stress) and a treatment by spray-drying (severe stress), one of the most appropriate preservation method for yeasts and other micro-organisms. The expression of selected desiccation-related genes has been also assessed in order to validate predictive marker for desiccation tolerance. Our data demonstrate that the \"mild\" and the \"severe\" desiccation treatments give similar results in terms of cell recovery, but the choice of marker genes strictly depends on the growth phase in which cells undergo desiccation. The indigenous CD-6Sc was ultimately identified as a high dehydration stress tolerant indigenous strain suitable for ADY production. This study highlights the exploitation of natural yeast biodiversity as a source of hidden technological features and as an alternative approach to strain improvement by genetic modifications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d3c","authors":["Zambuto, Marianna","Romaniello, Rossana","Guaragnella, Nicoletta","Romano, Patrizia","Votta, Sonia","Capece, Angela"],"doi":"10.1002\/yea.3245","first_seen_on":"2017-07-22T10:14:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0749-503X","1097-0061"],"journal":"Yeast","last_mentioned_on":1500718454,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28732117?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28732117","pubdate":"2017-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Identification by phenotypic and genetic approaches of an indigenous Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n wine strain with high desiccation tolerance","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255259,"mean":6.9732582659374,"rank":7139998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255259,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167668,"mean":11.632125498757,"rank":136759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167668,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292,"mean":2.5789278350515,"rank":227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":5.545,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/888703726478696448","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22274399],"posted_on":"2017-07-22T10:14:14+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
