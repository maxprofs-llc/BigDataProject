This study was performed to detect antibiotic resistant bacteria in untreated hospital waste.\nWaste water samples were collected from sewerage disposal points of two renowned hospital of Dhaka city and a total of 59 Escherichia coli and 29 Klebsiella pneumonia isolates were isolated. Antibiotic susceptibility were measured by disc diffusion method.\nResistance among E. coli and K. pneumoniae to 10 frequently used antibiotic tested were respectively as follows: cefotaxime (CTX) 48 and 45%; ceftazidime (CAZ) 40 and 38%; ampicillin (AMP) 71 and 100%; streptomycin (S) 50 and 34%; sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) 58 and 28%; ciprofloxacin (CIP) 71 and 48%; kanamycin (K) 38 and 10%; chloramphenicol (C) 28 and 10%; gentamycin (CN) 19 and 16% and imipenem (IPM) 12 and 7%.\nalso demonstrate that the sites that were at the disposal point of hospital waste have higher degree of resistance. High degree of resistance was observed when 23 high-resistant E. coli isolates were further tested with 15 additional antibiotics.\nThis study revealed a significant rise of MDR bacteria in the hospital waste and underscore necessity of hospital waste treatment.","altmetric_jid":"521611773cf058827c00004c","authors":["Rabbani, M.A.G.","Hawlader, Md.
