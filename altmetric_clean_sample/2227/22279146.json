The UNICEF-managed SMNet was created as a strategy to eradicate polio by engaging >7000 frontline social mobilizers to advocate for vaccination in some of the most underserved, marginalized, and at-risk communities in India. This network focused initially on generating demand for polio vaccination but later expanded its messaging to promote routine immunization and other health and sanitation interventions related to maternal and children's health. As an impact of the network's interventions, in collaboration with other eradication efforts, these high-risk pockets witnessed an increase in full routine immunization coverage. The experience of the SMNet offers lessons for health-system strengthening for social mobilization and promoting positive health behaviors for other priority health programs like the Universal Immunization Program.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Deutsch, Nicole","Singh, Prem","Singh, Vivek","Curtis, Rod","Siddique, Anisur Rahman"],"doi":"10.1093\/infdis\/jix068","first_seen_on":"2017-07-22T17:06:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0022-1899","1537-6613"],"issue":"suppl_1","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1503567759,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article\/216\/suppl_1\/S260\/3935067\/Legacy-of-PolioUse-of-Indias-Social-Mobilization?rss=1&utm_content=buffer3828f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article\/216\/suppl_1\/S260\/3935067\/Legacy-of-Polio-Use-of-India-s-Social-Mobilization"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article-pdf\/216\/suppl_1\/S260\/18251956\/jix068.pdf","pmid":"28838190","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"OUP accepted manuscript","type":"article","volume":"216","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/legacy-polio-indias-social-mobilization-network-strengthening-universal-immunization-program-india"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.55,"score_history":{"1y":5.55,"6m":5.55,"3m":5.55,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":1531324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6886065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222592,"mean":12.908480872991,"rank":53307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":168963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222592,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6953,"mean":6.6041467203682,"rank":1641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6953,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":9.3533043478261,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"IN":3}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/postpolionews\/statuses\/888807381819326464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22279146],"posted_on":"2017-07-22T17:06:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Post-Polio News","url":"https:\/\/www.post-polio.org.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000571299619\/4fad51378685b137344ccbd5b7c9aee3_normal.png","description":"Incorporating NewsBites (Est. 1997) & Polio and Post-Polio News (Est. 2004).
