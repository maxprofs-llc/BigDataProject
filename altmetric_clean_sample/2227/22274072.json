(2) To assess the capability of the MPS to identify different seizure types.\n120 EEG records from children with intractable seizures were converted to MPS by taking the median power across leads and using multi-taper spectral estimation. Twelve blinded neurology residents were trained to interpret the spectrogram with a five-minute video tutorial and post-test. Two residents independently assessed each set for presence of seizures. Their performance was compared to seizures identified using conventional EEG. Two blinded neurologists separately reviewed the EEGs and spectrograms to independently categorize the seizures. Their results were used to determine the spectrogram's capability to reveal seizures and visualize different seizure types for the user.\nThree key MPS features distinguished seizures from inter-ictal background: power difference relative to background, down-sloping resonance bands, and power in high frequencies. Using these features, residents identified seizures with 77% sensitivity and 72% specificity. 86% (51\/59) of focal seizures and 81% (22\/27) of generalized seizures were detected by at least one resident. Missed seizures included brief (<60s) seizures, tonic seizures, seizures with predominant delta (0-4Hz) activity, and seizures evident primarily in supplementary low temporal leads.\nThe MPS is a novel qEEG modality that requires minimal training to interpret. It enables physicians without extensive neurophysiology training to identify seizures with sensitivity and specificity comparable to more complex multi-modal qEEG displays.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088e0","authors":["Peter Yan","Tamar Melman","Sherry Yan","Munkhzul Otgonsuren","Zachary Grinspan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.seizure.2017.06.016","first_seen_on":"2017-07-22T10:01:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["10591311","1532-2688"],"journal":"Seizure","last_mentioned_on":1500840431,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28732280?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28732280?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28732280","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Evaluation of a novel median power spectrogram for seizure detection by non-neurophysiologists","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-novel-median-power-spectrogram-seizure-detection-nonneurophysiologists"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261251,"mean":6.9754429808982,"rank":6267883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1116379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261251,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170755,"mean":11.625204856109,"rank":120180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170755,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":916,"mean":3.3114885245902,"rank":650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":916,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.2181818181818,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EpilepticDanio\/statuses\/888700485271793664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22274072],"posted_on":"2017-07-22T10:01:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Epilepsy & Zebrafish","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/894208500817170437\/b0xsJZl5_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"EpilepticDanio","tweeter_id":"872858535297679360","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":11},"tweet_id":"888700485271793664"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JohnMillichapMD\/statuses\/889215336028880896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22274072],"posted_on":"2017-07-23T20:07:11+00:00","author":{"name":"John J.
