Many applications, notably in nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology, benefit from the enhanced optical properties of these materials, which can be exploited to image, damage or destroy targeted cells and sub-cellular structures with unprecedented precision. Modern inorganic chemistry enables the synthesis of a large library of nanoparticles with an increasing variety of shapes, composition, and optical characteristic. However, identifying and tailoring nanoparticles morphology to specific applications remains challenging and limits the development of efficient nanoplasmonic technologies. In this work, we report a strategy for the rational design of gold plasmonic nanoshells (AuNS) for the efficient ultrafast laser-based nanoscale bubble generation and cell membrane perforation, which constitute one of the most crucial challenges towards the development of effective gene therapy treatments. We design an in-silico rational design framework that we use to tune AuNS morphology to simultaneously optimize for the reduction of the cavitation threshold while preserving the particle structural integrity. Our optimization procedure yields optimal AuNS that are slightly detuned compared to their plasmonic resonance conditions, with an optical breakdown threshold 30 % lower than randomly selected AuNS, and 13 % lower compared to similarly optimized gold nanoparticles (AuNP). This design strategy is validated using time-resolved bubble spectroscopy, shadowgraphy imaging and electron microscopy that confirm the particle structural integrity and a reduction of 51 % of the cavitation threshold relative to optimal AuNP. Rationally designed AuNS are finally used to perforate cancer cells with an efficiency of 61 %, using 33 % less energy compared to AuNP, which demonstrate that our rational design framework is readily transferable to a cell environment. The methodology developed here thus provides a general strategy for the systematic design of nanoparticles for nanomedical applications and should be broadly applicable to bio-imaging and cell nanosurgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["R\u00e9mi Lachaine","Lachaine, Remi","Boutopoulos, Christos","Lajoie, Pierre-Yves","Boulais, Etienne","Meunier, Michel","Christos Boutopoulos","Pierre-Yves Lajoie","\u00c9tienne Boulais","Michel Meunier"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.nanolett.6b00562","endpage":"3194","first_seen_on":"2016-04-13T18:02:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-6992","1530-6984"],"issue":"5","journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1470433915,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.6b00562"],"pmid":"27048763","pubdate":"2016-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"3187","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Rational Design of Plasmonic Nanoparticles for Enhanced Cavitation and Cell Perforation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.6b00562","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rational-design-plasmonic-nanoparticles-enhanced-cavitation-cell-perforation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":7070684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275123,"mean":11.530156592348,"rank":231829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275123,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4268,"mean":12.519384110616,"rank":3943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4268,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177,"mean":18.672113636364,"rank":168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
