Healthy older adults (n = 928) underwent cognitive assessments at baseline with two subsequent annual follow-ups, and completed scales regarding their perceptions, attitudes, and driving behaviours. Multivariate analysis showed small but statistically significant relationships between the cognitive tests and self-report measures, with the largest magnitudes between scores on the Trails B cognitive task (seconds), perceptions of driving abilities (\u03b2 = -0.32), and situational driving avoidance (\u03b2 = 0.55) (p < 0.05). Cognitive slowing and executive dysfunction appear to be associated with modestly lower perceived driving abilities and more avoidance of driving situations over time in this exploratory analysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000dc7","authors":["Mark J.\u00a0Rapoport","Paweena\u00a0Sukhawathanakul","Gary\u00a0Naglie","Holly\u00a0Tuokko","Anita\u00a0Myers","Alexander\u00a0Crizzle","Nicol\u00a0Korner-Bitensky","Brenda\u00a0Vrkljan","Michel\u00a0B\u00e9dard","Michelle M.\u00a0Porter","Barbara\u00a0Mazer","Isabelle\u00a0G\u00e9linas","Malcolm\u00a0Man-Son-Hing","Shawn\u00a0Marshall","Rapoport, Mark J","Sukhawathanakul, Paweena","Naglie, Gary","Tuokko, Holly","Myers, Anita","Crizzle, Alexander","Korner-Bitensky, Nicol","Vrkljan, Brenda","B\u00e9dard, Michel","Porter, Michelle M","Mazer, Barbara","G\u00e9linas, Isabelle","Man-Son-Hing, Malcolm","Marshall, Shawn",", "],"doi":"10.1017\/s071498081600009x","endpage":"11","first_seen_on":"2016-04-13T19:10:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1710-1107"],"journal":"Canadian Journal on Aging","last_mentioned_on":1460722507,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10258906&fileId=S071498081600009X"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S071498081600009X","pmid":"27021848","pubdate":"2016-03-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Cognitive Performance, Driving Behavior, and Attitudes over Time in Older Adults","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cognitive-performance-driving-behavior-attitudes-time-older-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":3149569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4295863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270464,"mean":11.358928570636,"rank":108553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":157160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270464,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167,"mean":2.8626626506024,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.3236842105263,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
