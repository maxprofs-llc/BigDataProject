All synthesized butyrolactone analogues were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Streptococcus gordonii. Among the derivatives, B-12 and B-13 had the lowest MIC of 9.38\u03bcg\/mL where they have shown to be stronger bactericidals, by 2-3 times, than the reference antibiotic, doxycycline. These two compounds were then checked for their cytotoxicity against human gingival epithelial cell lines, Ca9-22, and macrophages, THP-1, by MTT and LDH assays which confirmed their safety against the tested cell lines. A preliminary study of the structure-activity relationships unveiled that the functional groups at the C4 position had an important influence on the antibacterial activity. An optimum length of the alkyl chain at the C5 position registered the best antibacterial inhibitory activity however as its length increased the bactericidal effect increased as well. This efficiency was attained by a carboxyl group substitution at the C4 position indicating the important dual role contributed by these two substituents which might be involved in their mechanism of action.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f1","authors":["Sweidan, Alaa","Chollet-Krugler, Marylene","van de Weghe, Pierre","Chokr, Ali","Tomasi, Sophie","Bonnaure-Mallet, Martine","Bousarghin, Latifa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmc.2016.09.040","first_seen_on":"2016-10-18T20:27:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-3391","09680896"],"issue":"22","journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1474454972,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0968089616307349"],"pmid":"27687969","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of potential antibacterial butyrolactones","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-synthesis-biological-evaluation-potential-antibacterial-butyrolactones"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":6385410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1142232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249714,"mean":12.777058559226,"rank":174349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":45324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249714,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1373,"mean":2.3983571428571,"rank":831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1373,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":4.6936363636364,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pw_researchgrou\/statuses\/778546700076060672","license":"public","citation_ids":[12737385],"posted_on":"2016-09-21T10:49:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Pierre van de Weghe","url":"https:\/\/international.univ-rennes1.fr","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/554540948487958529\/Sgi9ALOA_normal.jpeg","description":"vice-pdt International Relations @UnivRennes1 & Prof Org Chem - Total synthesis, Med Chem, Catalysis.
