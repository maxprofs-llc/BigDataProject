Inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), prevents the development of many of these inflammation-induced preclinical behaviors. However, dysregulation in the balance of downstream metabolism, where neuroactive kynurenines are generated, is hypothesized to be a functionally important pathogenic feature of inflammation-induced depression. Here we utilized two novel transgenic mouse strains to directly test the hypothesis that neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism causes depressive-like behavior following peripheral immune activation. Wild-type (WT) or kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO)-deficient (KMO(-\/-)) mice were administered either lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.5\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1)) or saline intraperitoneally. Depressive-like behavior was measured across multiple domains 24\u2009h after immune challenge. LPS precipitated a robust depressive-like phenotype, but KMO(-\/-) mice were specifically protected from LPS-induced immobility in the tail suspension test (TST) and reduced spontaneous alternations in the Y-maze. Direct administration of 3-hydroxykynurenine, the metabolic product of KMO, caused a dose-dependent increase in depressive-like behaviors. Mice with targeted deletion of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase (HAAO), the enzyme that generates quinolinic acid, were similarly challenged with LPS. Similar to KMO(-\/-) mice, LPS failed to increase immobility during the TST. Whereas kynurenine metabolism was generally increased in behaviorally salient brain regions, a distinct shift toward KMO-dependent kynurenine metabolism occurred in the dorsal hippocampus in response to LPS. Together, these results demonstrate that KMO is a pivotal mediator of hippocampal-dependent depressive-like behaviors induced by peripheral LPS challenge.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008be7","authors":["J M Parrott","L Redus","D Santana-Coelho","J Morales","X Gao","J C O'Connor"],"doi":"10.1038\/tp.2016.200","first_seen_on":"2016-10-18T19:51:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["false","2158-3188"],"issue":"10","journal":"Translational Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1476914237,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/tp\/journal\/v6\/n10\/abs\/tp2016200a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/tp\/journal\/v6\/n10\/full\/tp2016200a.html"],"pmid":"27754481","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neuroscience","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular neuroscience","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"e918","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism is increased in the dorsal hippocampus and drives distinct depressive behaviors during inflammation","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neurotoxic-kynurenine-metabolism-increased-dorsal-hippocampus-drives-distinct-depressive-behaviors-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7560115,"mean":6.5270342886323,"rank":5722471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1012090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7560115,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236421,"mean":12.53048285255,"rank":164524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":42939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236421,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":923,"mean":18.27032537961,"rank":796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":923,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":12.455243243243,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
