Besides efficiently scavenging the mechanical energy of internal organs, this study proposes a self-powered, flexible and one-stop implantable triboelectric active sensor (iTEAS) that can provide continuous monitoring of multiple physiological and pathological signs. As demonstrated in human-scale animals, the device can monitor the heart rates, reaching an accuracy of ~99%. Cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular premature contraction can be detected in real-time. Further, a novel method of monitoring respiratory rates and phases is established by analyzing variations of the output peaks of the iTEAS. The blood pressure can be independently estimated and the velocity of blood flow be calculated with aid of a separate arterial pressure catheter. With the core-shell packaging strategy, monitoring functionality remains excellent during 72 hours after closure of the chest. The in vivo biocompatibility of the device is examined after 2 weeks of implantation, proving suitability for practical use. As a multifunctional biomedical monitor which is exempt from external power supply, the proposed iTEAS holds great potential in future healthcare industry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Ye Ma"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.nanolett.6b01968","endpage":"6051","first_seen_on":"2016-10-18T20:22:53+00:00","issns":["1530-6992","1530-6984"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1475009826,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.6b01968?ref=tw&hootPostID=d4046fd6910774d57a4c6f830eb766c2"],"pmid":"27607151","pubdate":"2016-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"6042","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Self-Powered, One-Stop, and Multifunctional Implantable Triboelectric Active Sensor for Real-Time Biomedical Monitoring","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfpowered-onestop-multifunctional-implantable-triboelectric-active-sensor-realtime-biomedical-moni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.15,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":1845536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6593650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250080,"mean":12.775583243695,"rank":74678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":175356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250080,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4364,"mean":12.489316525327,"rank":1870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4364,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220,"mean":21.15499543379,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
