Meta-analyses were performed to examine the association of the miR-196a2 C>T and miR-499 A>G polymorphisms with HBV-related HCC risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.\nA total of 13 studies involving 3,964 cases and 5,875 healthy controls were included. Random-effect meta-analysis showed that the T allele and TT genotype of miR-196a2 C>T were associated with significantly lower HBV-related HCC risk (allelic model, OR =0.84, 95% CI =0.71-0.99, P=0.04; homozygous model, OR =0.68, 95% CI =0.47-0.98, P=0.04). In contrast, miR-499 A>G showed no significant association with HBV-related HCC risk in either overall pooled analysis or ethnic subgroup analysis according to any of the four genetic models. Based on analysis of ethnic subgroups, neither miR-196a2 C>T nor miR-499 A>G was significantly associated with risk of HBV-related HCC in Chinese population.\nThe polymorphism miR-196a2 C>T, but not miR-499 A>G, may be associated with decreased HBV-related HCC risk. These conclusions should be verified in large, well-designed studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bca2","authors":["Zhu, Shao-Liang","Zhong, Jian-Hong","Gong, Wen-Feng","Li, Hang","Li, Le-Qun"],"doi":"10.2147\/ott.s96738","first_seen_on":"2016-05-05T19:12:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-6930"],"journal":"OncoTargets and therapy","last_mentioned_on":1462475637,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27143913?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27143913","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"2111","title":"Association of the miR-196a2 C&gt;T and miR-499 A&gt;G polymorphisms with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma risk: an updated meta-analysis","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-mir196a2-ct-mir499-ag-polymorphisms-hepatitis-b-virusrelated-hepatocellular-carcinoma-ri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7657182,"mean":6.5797688551388,"rank":5518562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1865372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7657182,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266429,"mean":11.383605011485,"rank":171286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":79774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266429,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":924,"mean":1.771105092091,"rank":420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":924,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.4244186046512,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/728301265227108352","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7188061],"posted_on":"2016-05-05T19:12:07+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
