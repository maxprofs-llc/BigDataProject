Infants had body composition measured (using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and HBM collected.\nA significant interaction between maternal BMI and infant sex on insulin levels (p\u2009=\u20090.0322) was observed such that insulin was 229% higher in obese mothers nursing female infants than in normal weight mothers nursing female infants and 179% higher than obese mothers nursing male infants. For leptin, a significant association with BMI category was observed (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) such that overweight and obese mothers had 96.5% and 315.1% higher leptin levels than normal weight mothers, respectively. Leptin was also found to have a significant (p\u2009=\u20090.0004) 33.7% decrease from months 1 to 6, controlling for BMI category and sex. A significant inverse relationship between month 1 leptin levels and infant length (p\u2009=\u20090.0257), percent fat (p\u2009=\u20090.0223), total fat mass (p\u2009=\u20090.0226) and trunk fat mass (p\u2009=\u20090.0111) at month 6 was also found. No associations or interactions were observed for glucose, TNF-\u03b1 or IL-6.\nThese data demonstrate that maternal BMI, infant sex and stage of lactation affect the compositional make-up of insulin and leptin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e83","authors":["Fields, D.A.","George, B.","Williams, M.","Whitaker, K.","Allison, D.B.","Teague, A.","Demerath, E.W."],"doi":"10.1111\/ijpo.12182","endpage":"85","first_seen_on":"2017-02-10T23:32:15+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["20476302","2047-6310"],"issue":"S1","journal":"International Journal of Pediatric Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1505182501,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ijpo.12182\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview&utm_content=bufferead42&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fijpo.12182#.WKgKecuz8LY.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fijpo.12182#.WK3c7T2s2Ug.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/doi\/10.1111\/ijpo.12182\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ijpo.12182\/full?utm_content=bufferd5e06&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ijpo.12182\/pdf","pmid":"28160457","pubdate":"2017-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"78","subjects":["metabolism","pediatrics"],"title":"Associations between human breast milk hormones and adipocytokines and infant growth and body composition in the first 6 months of life","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/ijpo.12182","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/associations-between-human-breast-milk-hormones-adipocytokines-infant-growth-body-composition-first"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.65,"score_history":{"1y":7.65,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":1166739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7235448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280746,"mean":12.66918081533,"rank":56947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":223646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280746,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":561,"mean":11.20575,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":561,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":14.46,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
