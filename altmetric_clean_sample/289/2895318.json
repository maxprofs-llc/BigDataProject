For the different samples, the temperature of the maximum carbon oxidation rate was determined by thermogravimetric analysis, and a kinetic model was proposed for the degradation of the materials in an oxidizing atmosphere (synthetic air). The effect of the addition of different amounts of CuBr2 was studied, finding that its presence accelerates the degradation of the carbonaceous structure in the presence of oxygen. The thermal degradation of the samples in air is satisfactorily described by a first-order single-reaction model. In addition, combustion runs of one of the mixtures (consisting of activated carbon+50 wt % CuBr2, pyrolyzed at 700 \u00b0C) were performed in a quartz horizontal laboratory furnace. The analysis of the emissions and the solid residue proved the formation of brominated dioxins and furans at 300, 400, and 500 \u00b0C, with a maximum yield at 300 \u00b0C (91.7 ng\/g of total PBDD\/Fs) and a higher bromination degree with increasing temperature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Nuria Ortu\u00f1o"],"doi":"10.1021\/es501818d","first_seen_on":"2014-11-17T11:44:19+00:00","issns":["0013-936X"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1416224623,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/es501818d"],"pmid":"24946180","pubdate":"2014-06-20T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"De novo synthesis of brominated dioxins and furans.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novo-synthesis-brominated-dioxins-furans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4517894,"mean":5.2830313263467,"rank":2318408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1604348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4517894,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136682,"mean":8.1657615908577,"rank":68034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":52205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136682,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4713,"mean":8.6744469439728,"rank":2951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4713,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212,"mean":11.042132701422,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
