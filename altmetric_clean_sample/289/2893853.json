Clinical presentation can be variable, and symptoms may be due to neck pain or compressive myeloradiculopathy. We discuss the pathology, grading systems, clinical presentation, indications for surgery and surgical management of cervical myelopathy related to rheumatoid arthritis in this paper. We describe our surgical technique and results. We recommend early consultation for surgical management when involvement of the cervical spine is suspected in rheumatoid arthritis. Even patients with advanced cervical myelopathy should be discussed for surgical treatment, since in our experience improvement in function after surgery is common.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004281","authors":["Mukerji N","Todd NV"],"doi":"10.1155\/2011\/153628","first_seen_on":"2014-11-16T21:04:02+00:00","issns":["2090-1852"],"issue":"","journal":"Neurology Research International","last_mentioned_on":1416183139,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22203899?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3238417","pmid":"22203899","pubdate":"2011-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Cervical myelopathy in rheumatoid arthritis.","type":"article","volume":"2011","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cervical-myelopathy-rheumatoid-arthritis-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4517894,"mean":5.2830313263467,"rank":2016223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2393070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4517894,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116661,"mean":9.0227477455856,"rank":49473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":63386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116661,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":2.2985901639344,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":21.53,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
