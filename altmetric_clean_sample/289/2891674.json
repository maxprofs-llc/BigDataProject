Co-delivery of antigens to DC with essential components like genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules or stimulation with recombinant cytokines is a potential method for designing an effective tumor vaccine protocol. Here, we describe the stimulation of purified splenic- or bone marrow-derived DC with recombinant interleukin-15 (IL-15) in the presence of intact soluble antigen from metastatic lymphoma tumor cells in an experimental animal model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Hira SK","Verma D","Manna PP"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-0345-0_6","first_seen_on":"2014-11-15T14:46:01+00:00","issns":["1064-3745"],"issue":"","journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1416076810,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24619670?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24619670","pubdate":"2014-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vaccine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Tumor antigen-\/cytokine-pulsed dendritic cells in therapy against lymphoma.","type":"article","volume":"1139","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumor-antigencytokinepulsed-dendritic-cells-therapy-against-lymphoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3579954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":140835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122166,"mean":8.5724876192038,"rank":93937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122166,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3194,"mean":1.3740219229565,"rank":2026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3194,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.1014328358209,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/533631916340424704","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2891674],"posted_on":"2014-11-15T14:45:37+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
