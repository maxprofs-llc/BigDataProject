Although the positive outcomes of lay representative involvement can include more relevant research questions and outcomes, challenges are also apparent, including tokenistic involvement by research teams. A Cancer Research UK-funded and National Cancer Research Institute-registered cancer clinical trials unit in the United Kingdom established a program of work to promote genuine and consistent involvement of lay representatives (or \"research partners\") as part of the research team. Furthermore, a volunteer was employed to recruit and coordinate the research partners in partnership with a national agency for public involvement in health and social care research in Wales. This article reports on the development of this project and how it will be formally evaluated. Recommendations for involving lay representatives are also posed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc71","authors":["Jim Fitzgibbon","Jessica Baillie","Natalie Simon","Annmarie Nelson"],"doi":"10.2147\/ppa.s66734","first_seen_on":"2014-11-15T11:10:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-889X"],"journal":"Patient preference and adherence","last_mentioned_on":1416299870,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25395838?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4226446\/#!po=2.27273"],"pmid":"25395838","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"The role of the public in developing interventions: a reflection and critique of a cancer clinical trials unit\u2019s model","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-public-developing-interventions-refection-critique-cancer-clinical-trials-units-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4522755,"mean":5.2848280542506,"rank":1997369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2504541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4522755,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122470,"mean":8.7992587511943,"rank":50703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":71008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122470,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":424,"mean":2.2230165484634,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":424,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.463,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2},"mendeley":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/palliativewise\/status\/533577609008132096","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2891039],"posted_on":"2014-11-15T11:09:50+00:00","author":{"name":"palliativewise","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514052300982087682\/KD4yHF1g_normal.png","id_on_source":"palliativewise","tweeter_id":"2826469171","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":152},"tweet_id":"533577609008132096"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonathanboote\/status\/534602885875896320","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2891039],"posted_on":"2014-11-18T07:03:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Jonathan Boote","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Jonathan_Boote","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/903031718218747904\/-_mFRIC4_normal.jpg","description":"Researcher & consultant.
