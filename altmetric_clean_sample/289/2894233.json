Such a neural workspace should have two important properties: The ability to store sensory information across delay periods and the ability to flexibly transform sensory information. Here we used a combination of functional MRI and multivariate decoding to indentify such neural representations. Subjects were required to memorize a complex artificial pattern for an extended delay, then rotate the mental image as instructed by a cue and memorize this transformed pattern. We found that patterns of brain activity already in early visual areas and posterior parietal cortex encode not only the initially remembered image, but also the transformed contents after mental rotation. Our results thus suggest that the flexible and general neural workspace supporting visual working memory can be realized within posterior brain regions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2014.11.018","first_seen_on":"2014-11-17T01:30:34+00:00","issns":["10538119","1095-9572"],"journal":"NeuroImage","last_mentioned_on":1417664830,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1053811914009355","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25463456?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25463456","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Parietal and early visual cortex encode working memory content across mental transformations.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parietal-early-visual-cortices-encode-working-memory-content-across-mental-transformations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6566032,"mean":6.0853440493961,"rank":1086306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5476485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6566032,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195244,"mean":7.7091719651923,"rank":39077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":156001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195244,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4719,"mean":7.0952971598135,"rank":1388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":3319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4719,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":8.9034680851064,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
