Depositions lead to an inflammatory response that can ultimately destroy renal function and lead to chronic kidney disease. However, the pathological processes leading to the development of renal injury and disease progression remain poorly understood. To investigate the mechanisms of disease development in glomerulonephritis various animal models have been developed, which include as the most popular one the induction of glomerulonephritis by the injection of heterologous antibodies directed to the glomerular basement membrane. The role of mast cells and mast cell-derived mediators has been evaluated in these models. In this chapter we describe the methods that allow to set up and study the disease parameters of immune-mediated glomerulonephritis development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Monteiro RC","Beghdadi W","Madjene LC","Pons M","Peuchmaur M","Blank U"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-1568-2_29","first_seen_on":"2014-11-16T23:45:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1064-3745"],"issue":"","journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1416181463,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25388269"],"pmid":"25388269","pubdate":"2014-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The function of mast cells in autoimmune glomerulonephritis.","type":"article","volume":"1220","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/function-mast-cells-autoimmune-glomerulonephritis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":3651952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":143277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116498,"mean":8.9858152742133,"rank":92092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116498,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3195,"mean":1.4008240450845,"rank":2050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3195,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.0521791044776,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"The function of mast cells in autoimmune glomerulonephritis. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100004600507770\/posts\/1501630420112520","license":"public","citation_ids":[2894033],"posted_on":"2014-11-16T23:44:23+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25388269 \n2015;1220:487-96. doi: 10.1007\/978-1-4939-1568-2_29.\nThe function of mast cells in autoimmune glomerulonephritis.     \n\n>The role of mast cells and mast cell-derived mediators has been evaluated in these models.","author":{"name":"Cathy Scofield","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100004600507770","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/100004600507770\/picture","id_on_source":"100004600507770"}}]}}
