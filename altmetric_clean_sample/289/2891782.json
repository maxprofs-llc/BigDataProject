All published studies report benign tumors with a diameter <2-3\u200acm and no invasion of the testis. In this article, we present one case of a giant malignant paraganglioma in the testis of a patient who had initially been operated for a giant mass in the scrotum. The mass developed in approximately 4 months. This is the first study reporting the following findings: i) paraganglioma was found exclusively in the testis, invading the testicle and not the spermatic cord, ii) it was malignant with lung metastasis, and iii) its size was 17.5\u200acm\u00d710\u200acm\u00d79.5\u200acm. We present the first - giant - malignant paraganglioma. Moreover, it is the first case report of a paraganglioma in the testis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"548ec0372a83ee48028b4569","authors":["Marinos C Makris","Konstantinos C Koumarelas","Apostolos S Mitrousias","Giannos G Psathas","Athanasios Mantzioros","Stratigoula P Sakellariou","Panagiota Ntailiani","Evripides Yettimis"],"doi":"10.1530\/edm-14-0055","first_seen_on":"2014-11-15T15:28:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2052-0573"],"journal":"EDM Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1416065246,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25392737?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25392737","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"A 'giant' paraganglioma in the testis.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/giant-paraganglioma-testis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3579961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":140835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122166,"mean":8.572483935661,"rank":93935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122166,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":0.65396825396825,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
