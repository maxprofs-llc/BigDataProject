The regulatory relations are usually modeled as a network; simply, every gene is modeled as a node and relations are shown as edges between two related genes. This paper presents a novel method for inferring correlation networks, networks constructed by connecting co-expressed genes, through predicting co-expression level from genes promoter's sequences. According to the results, this method works well on biological data and its outcome is comparable to the methods that use microarray as input. The method is written in C++ language and is available upon request from the corresponding author.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007518","authors":["Ghasem Mahdevar","Abbas Nowzari-Dalini","Mehdi Sadeghi"],"first_seen_on":"2014-11-16T15:08:58+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1880-5779"],"issue":"5","journal":"Genes and Genetic Systems","last_mentioned_on":1416150491,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24694393?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24694393","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Inferring gene correlation networks from transcription factor binding sites.","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inferring-gene-correlation-networks-transcription-factor-binding-sites"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":3651960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":143266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116499,"mean":8.9858278425383,"rank":92095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116499,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":1.3360224719101,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
