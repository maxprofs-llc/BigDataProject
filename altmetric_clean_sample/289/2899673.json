In the literature there are a number of descriptions of outbreaks or experimental investigations involving meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Acinetobacter spp., and other pathogens. Often only the bedrail has been sampled during investigation of outbreaks, rather than more important potential reservoirs of infection, such as mattresses and pillows, which are in direct contact with patients. It is essential that these items and other bed components are adequately decontaminated to minimise the risk of cross-infection, but detailed advice on this aspect is often lacking in reports and official documents. Clear guidelines should be formulated, specifying the decontamination procedure for each component of the bed. In outbreaks, investigation should include an assessment of mattresses and pillow contamination as a critical aspect in outbreak management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a48","authors":["Creamer E","Humphreys H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jhin.2008.01.014","first_seen_on":"2014-11-18T13:32:44+00:00","issns":["01956701"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","last_mentioned_on":1416317698,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18355943"],"pmid":"18355943","pubdate":"2008-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hospitals","communicablediseases"],"title":"The contribution of beds to healthcare-associated infection: the importance of adequate decontamination.","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contribution-beds-healthcareassociated-infection-importance-adequate-decontamination"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2163061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2869369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164864,"mean":7.9975288572939,"rank":61312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":103417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164864,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":731,"mean":5.9835726027397,"rank":359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":731,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":5.2791666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
