We report on a primary HIV-1 infection in a Caucasian patient. A routine quantitative assay (Nuclisens EasyQ HIV-1 2.0, BioM\u00e9rieux SA) showed 6,700 HIV-1 RNA copies\/ml. A combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) consistent with low baseline HIV-1 RNA was started. Few days later, the analysis performed with REGA HIV-1 Subtyping Tool - Version 3.0 attributed the HIV-1 sequence to the CRF02_AG recombinant form. Therefore, a second real-time PCR assay was performed, using the Versant HIV-1 RNA 1.0 Assay (kPCR) (Siemens HealthCare Diagnostics) which revealed a HIV-1 RNA of 230,000 copies\/ml. Consequently, the ongoing cART was potentiated. This case suggests that the wide genetic variability of HIV-1 subtypes may affect the capability of the commonly used assays to detect and accurately quantify HIV-1 RNA in non-B subtypes and CRFs. In presence of CRFs different commercial HIV-1 RNA tests should be performed to find the most reliable for viral load quantification at the diagnosis, because it influences the choice of cART, and during the follow-up. Indeed, international guidelines for HIV-1 infection management suggest to monitor patient' HIV-RNA with the same assay over the course of treatment. As different commercial tests can be performed in the same laboratory with considerable difficulty, the laboratory should select an assay that is suitable not only for the more prevalent strain, but also for less frequent ones that, nevertheless, can occur. Then, knowing and investigating the spread of non-B strains has essential clinical and laboratory implications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce51","authors":["Tatarelli, Paola","Taramasso, Lucia","Di Biagio, Antonio","Sticchi, Laura","Nigro, Nicola","Barresi, Renata","Viscoli, Claudio","Bruzzone, Bianca"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-26T05:05:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1121-7138"],"issue":"2","journal":"new microbiologica","last_mentioned_on":1464285654,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27196556"],"pmid":"27196556","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"HIV-1 RNA quantification in CRF02_AG HIV-1 infection: too easy to make mistakes.","type":"article","volume":"39"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7811999,"mean":6.6309711159621,"rank":3428592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4296873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7811999,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268966,"mean":11.415698756343,"rank":111882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":153139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268966,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":1.6805076923077,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/a_dibiagio\/statuses\/735695924312170496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8274101],"posted_on":"2016-05-26T04:55:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Antonio Di Biagio","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000816269928\/7f85ee3ba6d16f845ff7ac6a9d3f4862_normal.jpeg","description":"Medico, Infettivologo,  Genova","id_on_source":"a_dibiagio","tweeter_id":"452275230","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":101},"tweet_id":"735695924312170496"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ASprugnoli\/statuses\/735893486780702720","license":"gnip","rt":["a_dibiagio"],"citation_ids":[8274101],"posted_on":"2016-05-26T18:00:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Alessandro Sprugnoli","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/617641389438955520\/hRbXuLJz_normal.jpg","description":"Non chiamatemi perfezione!
