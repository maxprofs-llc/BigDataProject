These strains included the type strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Agrobacterium rhizogenes, Agrobacterium radiobacter, Agrobacterium vitis, Agrobacterium rubi, Rhizobium fredii, Rhizobium galegae, Rhizobium huakuii, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Rhizobium loti, Rhizobium meliloti, and Rhizobium tropici. A phylogenetic analysis showed that the 15 strains of Agrobacterium and Rhizobium species formed a compact phylogenetic cluster clearly separated from the other members of the alpha subclass of the Proteobacteria. However, Agrobacterium species and Rhizobium species are phylogenetically entwined with one another, and the two genera cannot be separated. In the Agrobacterium species, the strains of biovar 1, biovar 2, Agrobacterium rubi, and Agrobacterium vitis were clearly separated. The two biovars exhibited homogeneity in their phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and phylogenetic characteristics, and two species should be established for the two biovars. We considered the nomenclature of the two biovars, and revised descriptions of Agrobacterium radiobacter (for the biovar 1 strains) and Agrobacterium rhizogenes (for the biovar 2 strains) are proposed. The name Agrobacterium tumefaciens is rejected because the type strain of this species was assigned to Agrobacterium radiobacter, and consequently the description of the genus Agrobacterium is revised.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["HIROYUKI SAWADA","HIROYUKI IEKI","HIROSHI OYAIZU","SATOSHI MATSUMOTO","Sawada, H","Ieki, H","Oyaizu, H","Matsumoto, S"],"doi":"10.1099\/00207713-43-4-694","endpage":"702","first_seen_on":"2016-05-26T02:59:41+00:00","issns":["1466-5034","1465-2102","0020-7713"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1464231515,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1099\/00207713-43-4-694","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8240952"],"pmid":"8240952","pubdate":"1993-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Microbiology Society","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"694","subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"Proposal for Rejection of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Revised Descriptions for the Genus Agrobacterium and for Agrobacterium radiobacter and Agrobacterium rhizogenes","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proposal-rejection-agrobacterium-tumefaciens-revised-descriptions-genus-agrobacterium-agrobacterium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7811999,"mean":6.6309711159621,"rank":1913005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4821757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7811999,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268966,"mean":11.415877032327,"rank":85989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":179157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268966,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3533,"mean":2.7281109852775,"rank":398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3533,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":1.2868421052632,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
