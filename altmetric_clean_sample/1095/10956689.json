Brain aging was induced by DG treatment (100 mg\/kg body weight) via daily subcutaneous injection for 8 weeks.\nDG, EPA and DHA treatments changed brain fatty acid composition. DG down-regulated brain Bcl-2 expression and up-regulated Bax expression. Compared with DG groups, EPA and DHA further enhanced Bax expression. DG decreased glutathione content, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) production, the intake of EPA or DHA caused greater ROS and GSSG formation. DG treatments up-regulated the protein expression of p47(phox) and gp91(phox), and the intake of EPA or DHA led to greater p47(phox) and gp91(phox) expression. DG increased brain prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and activity, the intake of EPA or DHA reduced brain COX-2 activity and PGE2 formation. DG enhanced brain p53, p16 and p21 expression. EPA and DHA intake led to greater p21 expression, and EPA only caused greater p53 and p16 expression.\nThese findings suggest that these two PUFAs have toxic effects toward aging brain.","authors":["Yuan-Man Hsu","Mei-Chin Yin"],"doi":"10.7603\/s40681-016-0017-1","first_seen_on":"2016-09-01T02:02:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2211-8020","2211-8039"],"issue":"3","journal":"BioMedicine","last_mentioned_on":1472695338,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4980825\/"],"pmid":"27514534","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","title":"EPA or DHA enhanced oxidative stress and aging protein expression in brain of d-galactose treated mice","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epa-dha-enhanced-oxidative-stress-aging-protein-expression-brain-dgalactose-treated-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BioMedcine\/statuses\/771166233249013760","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10956689],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T02:02:12+00:00","author":{"name":"BioMedicine","url":"http:\/\/biomedicine.cmu.edu.tw\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573279765911613441\/UWQpAEpU_normal.jpeg","description":"BioMedicine (ISSN: 2211-8039), a peer-reviewed and open access journal","id_on_source":"BioMedcine","tweeter_id":"3061027646","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":12},"tweet_id":"771166233249013760"}],"googleplus":[{"url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/117708588731539391820\/posts\/EpmWsCUcFhs","license":"public","citation_ids":[10956689],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T02:02:18+00:00","summary":"EPA or DHA enhanced oxidative stress and aging protein expression in brain of d-galactose treated mice Effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6) upon fatty acid composition, oxidative and inflammatory factors and agi","author":{"name":"BioMedicine ISSN:2211-8039","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/117708588731539391820","image":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-iNU8vKAjGVY\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAAN0\/K1WJ128FkCU\/photo.jpg?sz=50","id_on_source":"117708588731539391820"}}]}}
