Paraneoplastic phenomena in general regress with cure and in most cases with treatment of the cancer. This study was undertaken to determine whether MP regressed with cancer treatment and cure.\nThis was a retrospective review of a database of all patients with MP confirmed on CT between 2003 and August 2015 at Christchurch Hospital. Patients were categorized as having malignant or non-malignant disease, and follow-up scans were assessed for remission of MP. Patients with malignancy were further categorized as having malignancy cured or not cured.\nA total of 308 patients were identified with possible MP; 135 were excluded as radiological appearances were not typical of MP (43 patients) or there was no follow-up CT (92). Of 173 patients (131 men) included, 75 (43\u00b74 per cent) were diagnosed with malignancy. Follow-up imaging showed that 33 patients (19\u00b71 per cent) had remission of MP, whereas 140 (80\u00b79 per cent) had no remission. There was no difference in the rates of MP remission in the malignancy versus no malignancy groups (P = 1\u00b7000), or between groups in which malignancy was cured or not cured (P = 0\u00b7572). Nor was there any difference in the rates of MP remission in malignancy cured versus no malignancy groups (P = 0\u00b7524).\nMP does not behave like a paraneoplastic phenomenon. The association with malignancy is most likely an epiphenomenon of the many CT images acquired for staging of cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002457","authors":["Buchwald, P.","Diesing, L.","Dixon, L.","Wakeman, C.","Eglinton, T.","Dobbs, B.","Frizelle, F."],"doi":"10.1002\/bjs.10229","endpage":"1730","first_seen_on":"2016-08-31T21:40:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2168"],"issue":"12","journal":"British Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1484376157,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bjs.10229\/abstract?hootPostID=fb94d1a160f341b06da8b1d101ce32ce"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bjs.10229\/pdf","pmid":"27515476","pubdate":"2016-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1727","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Cohort study of mesenteric panniculitis and its relationship to malignancy","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cohort-study-mesenteric-panniculitis-relationship-malignancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":3974836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4035049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248500,"mean":12.504713000857,"rank":124713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":121426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248500,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2234,"mean":6.5622140618003,"rank":1574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2234,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":13.96858974359,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"AT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BJSurgery\/statuses\/771100377756364800","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10954064],"posted_on":"2016-08-31T21:40:31+00:00","author":{"name":"BJS","url":"http:\/\/www.bjs.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/816210613806448640\/ln1pVTwV_normal.jpg","description":"BJS, formerly the British Journal of Surgery, is the premier peer-reviewed surgical journal in Europe, with an impact factor of 5.899.","id_on_source":"BJSurgery","tweeter_id":"266507266","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":11418},"tweet_id":"771100377756364800"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pascaleschmitt\/statuses\/820159165888864256","license":"gnip","rt":["BJSurgery"],"citation_ids":[10954064],"posted_on":"2017-01-14T06:42:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Christo Kienholz MD","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/904479027917881344\/AWl7lzSm_normal.jpg","description":"Dr. med.
