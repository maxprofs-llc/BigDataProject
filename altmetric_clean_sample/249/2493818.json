These advances are of particular interest to researchers studying organisms with missing or incomplete genomes, as the need for knowledge of sequence information is overcome. De novo assembly methods have gained widespread acceptance in the RNA-Seq community for organisms with no true reference genome or transcriptome. While such methods have tremendous utility, computational cost is still a significant challenge for organisms with large and complex genomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Benjamin AM","Nichols M","Burke TW","Ginsburg GS","Lucas JE","Ashlee M Benjamin","Marshall Nichols","Thomas W Burke","Geoffrey S Ginsburg","Joseph E Lucas"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-15-570","first_seen_on":"2014-07-08T19:21:56+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1471-2164",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1405528090,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/15\/570\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-15-570.pdf","pmid":"25001289","pubdate":"2014-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"570","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Comparing reference-based RNA-Seq mapping methods for non-human primate data","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2164-15-570","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparing-referencebased-rnaseq-mapping-methods-nonhuman-primate-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5336996,"mean":6.2508246434545,"rank":2463081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2740123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5336996,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130476,"mean":8.2890126384367,"rank":53736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":72673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130476,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4776,"mean":3.8751258638743,"rank":2517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":2032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4776,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":3.3256287878788,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
