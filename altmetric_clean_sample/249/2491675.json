A\u03b21-42 levels can be decreased by \u03b3-secretase modulators (GSM), which are small molecules that modulate \u03b3-secretase, an enzyme essential for A\u03b2 production. BMS-869780 is a potent GSM that decreased A\u03b21-42 and A\u03b21-40 and increased A\u03b21-37 and A\u03b21-38, without inhibiting overall levels of A\u03b2 peptides or other APP processing intermediates. BMS-869780 also did not inhibit Notch processing by \u03b3-secretase and lowered brain A\u03b21-42 without evidence of Notch-related side effects in rats. Human pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were predicted through allometric scaling of PK in rat, dog, and monkey and were combined with the rat pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters to predict the relationship between BMS-869780 dose, exposure and A\u03b21-42 levels in human. Off-target and safety margins were then based on comparisons to the predicted exposure required for robust A\u03b21-42 lowering. Because of insufficient safety predictions and the relatively high predicted human daily dose of 700\u2009mg, further evaluation of BMS-869780 as a potential clinical candidate was discontinued. Nevertheless, BMS-869780 demonstrates the potential of the GSM approach for robust lowering of brain A\u03b21-42 without Notch-related side effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5283cf058f610003dec","authors":["Toyn, Jeremy H."],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/431858","first_seen_on":"2014-07-08T03:11:41+00:00","issns":["2090-8024"],"journal":"International Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","last_mentioned_on":1404789074,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ijad\/2014\/431858\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ijad\/2014\/431858.pdf","pmid":"25097793","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Identification and Preclinical Pharmacology of the <svg xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" style=\"vertical-align:-3.636pt;width:11.1125px;\" id=\"M1\" height=\"15.0125\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 11.1125 15.0125\" width=\"11.1125\">\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t<g transform=\"matrix(.022,-0,0,-.022,.062,10.412)\"><path id=\"x1D738\" d=\"M377 450h126l-264 -401q0 -75 -21 -153q-12 -44 -36 -71t-56 -27q-27 0 -42 18.5t-15 42.5q0 34 30 89q9 16 32 50q21 31 29 46q13 91 13 208q0 45 -11 94q-11 47 -34 47q-38 0 -61 -81h-23q40 150 121 150q46 0 65 -34.5t19 -99.5q0 -54 -7 -125z\"><\/path><\/g>\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n<\/svg>-Secretase Modulator BMS-869780","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-preclinical-pharmacology-secretase-modulator-bms869780"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3579149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109079,"mean":7.9507923687639,"rank":84201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109079,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":3.6272950819672,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1,"Unspecified":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Chemistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"RU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ThihaSwe_dr\/status\/486346744863924225","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2491675],"posted_on":"2014-07-08T03:11:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Psychiatry Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PsychiatryUpdates.by.DrThihaSwe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3471096253\/6b7bd3fc313986902cd1574474364bae_normal.jpeg","description":"[RSS Updates from Psychiatry Journals globally, plus some mental health related news] \/ Should follow only if you are interested in Mental Health","id_on_source":"ThihaSwe_dr","tweeter_id":"1259166031","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":985},"tweet_id":"486346744863924225"}]}}
