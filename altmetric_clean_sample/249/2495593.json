Modulation of GSK-3\u03b2 in vSMC following ectopic expression of constitutively active GSK-3\u03b2, siRNA knockdown and pharmacological inhibition with SB-216763 demonstrated that GSK-3\u03b2 positively regulates Notch intracellular domain expression, CBF-1\/RBP-J\u03ba transactivation and downstream target gene mRNA levels, while concomitantly promoting vSMC proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 attenuated Notch signaling and decreased vSMC proliferation and survival. Exposure of vSMC to cyclic strain environments in vitro using both a Flexercell\u2122 Tension system and a novel Sylgard\u2122 phantom vessel following bare metal stent implantation revealed that cyclic strain inhibits GSK-3\u03b2 activity independent of p42\/p44 MAPK and p38 activation concomitant with reduced Notch signaling and decreased vSMC proliferation and survival. Exposure of vSMC to changes in medial strain microenvironments in vivo following carotid artery ligation revealed that enhanced GSK-3\u03b2 activity was predominantly localized to medial and neointimal vSMC concomitant with increased Notch signaling, proliferating nuclear antigen and decreased Bax expression, respectively, as vascular remodeling progressed. GSK-3\u03b2 is an important modulator of Notch signaling leading to altered vSMC cell growth where low strain\/tension microenvironments prevail.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000238b","authors":["Shaunta Guha","John P.
