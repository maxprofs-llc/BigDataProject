Several small series have reported long-term disease-free survival (DSF) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In this study, we analyze the outcomes of 289 patients receiving allogeneic transplantation for primary myelofibrosis between 1989 and 2002, from the database of the Center for International Bone Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). The median age was 47 years (range: 18-73 years). Donors were HLA identical siblings in 162 patients, unrelated individuals in 101 patients, and HLA nonidentical family members in 26 patients. Patients were treated with a variety of conditioning regimens and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens. Splenectomy was performed in 65 patients prior to transplantation. The 100-day treatment-related mortality was 18% for HLA identical sibling transplants, 35% for unrelated transplants, and 19% for transplants from alternative related donors. Corresponding 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 37%, 30%, and 40%, respectively. DFS rates were 33%, 27%, and 22%, respectively. DFS for patients receiving reduced-intensity transplants was comparable: 39% for HLA identical sibling donors and 17% for unrelated donors at 3 years. In this large retrospective series, allogeneic transplantation for myelofibrosis resulted in long-term relapse-free survival (RFS) in about one-third of patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e3","authors":["Ballen KK","Shrestha S","Sobocinski KA","Zhang MJ","Bashey A","Bolwell BJ","Cervantes F","Devine SM","Gale RP","Gupta V","Hahn TE","Hogan WJ","Kr\u00f6ger N","Litzow MR","Marks DI","Maziarz RT","McCarthy PL","Schiller G","Schouten HC","Roy V","Wiernik PH","Horowitz MM","Giralt SA","Arora M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbmt.2009.10.025","endpage":"367","first_seen_on":"2014-07-09T19:18:01+00:00","issns":["1083-8791","10838791"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biology of Blood & Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1480357972,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19879949?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/www.bbmt.org\/article\/S1083-8791(09)00496-0\/abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC2908949","pmid":"19879949","pubdate":"2009-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"358","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Outcome of transplantation for myelofibrosis.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcome-transplantation-myelofibrosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.35,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":729517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7089103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177124,"mean":7.376557691548,"rank":19637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":157434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177124,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1296,"mean":3.7791505791506,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1296,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.0039473684211,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
