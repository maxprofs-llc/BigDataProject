The test set was employed to assess the performance of several wave function correlated and density functional theory methods. We found that second-order correlation methods describe relatively well the dihydrogen complexes. However, for high accuracy inclusion of triple contributions is important. On the other hand, none of the considered density functional methods can simultaneously yield accurate bond lengths and interaction energies. However, we found that improved results can be obtained by the inclusion of nonlocal exchange contributions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["E. Fabiano","L. A. Constantin","F.
