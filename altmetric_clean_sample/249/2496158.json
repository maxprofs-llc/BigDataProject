Materials and Methods: We studied medical records of 9,320 patients and we extracted individualized medical details. We recorded the majority of symptoms and the majority of findings of physical examination into the system, which was named IMPACT\u00ae (Intelligent Medical Patient Record and Coding Tool). Subsequently the system was evaluated by clinicians, based on the examination of 1206 patients. Results: The evaluation results showed that IMPACT\u00ae is an efficient tool, easy to use even under time-pressing conditions. Conclusion: IMPACT\u00ae seems to be a promising tool for illustration-guided, structured data entry of medical narrative, in electronic patient records.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67f3cf058f6100098a4","authors":["Elias Papazissis"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-09T15:14:59+00:00","issns":["0926-9630"],"journal":"Studies in Health Technology & Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1404918813,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25000021?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25000021","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","medicalinformatics"],"title":"The development and evaluation of a new coding system for medical records.","type":"article","volume":"202","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-evaluation-new-coding-system-medical-records"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3053576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":926635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108687,"mean":7.9663153488033,"rank":71801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108687,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":791,"mean":1.5627316455696,"rank":410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":791,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.6928571428571,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AR":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DrDanielLuna\/status\/486890909259563008","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2496158],"posted_on":"2014-07-09T15:13:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Daniel Luna","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1799952177\/image_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"DrDanielLuna","tweeter_id":"255769205","geo":{"lt":-34.61315,"ln":-58.37723,"country":"AR"},"followers":460},"tweet_id":"486890909259563008"}]}}
