An appreciable decrease in faecal organisms, especially anaerobes, was apparent after 48 h of commencing the course, and most bacteria had disappeared from the stool after five days. There were three episodes of septicaemia, all with enteric organisms, whilst on these antibiotics; one proved fatal. The emergence of resistance to aminoglycosides in faecal flora, notably Klebsiella, in 6\/11 courses constituted a major problem in the use of such prophylaxis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8083cf058f61000baa0","authors":["K.
