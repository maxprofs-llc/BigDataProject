How these signals are coordinated at the molecular level to ensure coherent cellular responses remains unclear. Here, we illustrate a molecular circuit that integrates all major growth-regulating signals, including auxin, brassinosteroid, gibberellin, light, and temperature. Analyses of genome-wide targets, genetic and biochemical interactions demonstrate that the auxin-response factor ARF6, the light\/temperature-regulated transcription factor PIF4, and the brassinosteroid-signaling transcription factor BZR1, interact with each other and cooperatively regulate large numbers of common target genes, but their DNA-binding activities are blocked by the gibberellin-inactivated repressor RGA. In addition, a tripartite HLH\/bHLH module feedback-regulates PIFs and additional bHLH factors that interact with ARF6, and thereby modulates auxin sensitivity according to developmental and environmental cues. Our results demonstrate a central growth-regulation circuit that integrates hormonal, environmental, and developmental controls of cell elongation in Arabidopsis hypocotyl.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"560420b12a83eea5738b4567","authors":["Eunkyoo Oh","Jia-Ying Zhu","Ming-Yi Bai","Rafael Augusto Arenhart","Yu Sun","Zhi-Yong Wang"],"doi":"10.7554\/elife.03031","first_seen_on":"2014-07-09T09:53:45+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["2050-084X"],"journal":"eLife","last_mentioned_on":1421712000,"links":["http:\/\/elifesciences.org\/content\/3\/e03031","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.03031"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/elifesciences.org\/content\/3\/e03031.full.pdf","pmid":"24867218","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications Limited","title":"Cell elongation is regulated through a central circuit of interacting transcription factors in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-elongation-regulated-through-central-circuit-interacting-transcription-factors-arabidopsis-hypo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4842394,"mean":5.7741414812912,"rank":1857356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2945441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4842394,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118493,"mean":8.2698259460555,"rank":37640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":79830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118493,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2012,"mean":23.670393833913,"rank":1388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2012,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":25.326487804878,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Ph.
