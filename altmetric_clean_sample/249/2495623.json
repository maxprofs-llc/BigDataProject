Systematic reviews can do this by decreasing inappropriate clinical variation and quickly expediting the application of current, effective advances to everyday practice. However, research suggests that evidence from systematic reviews has not been widely adopted by health professionals. Little is known about the facilitators to uptake of research evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e38","authors":["Wallace, John","Byrne, Charles","Clarke, Mike"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1744-1609.2012.00288.x","endpage":"346","first_seen_on":"2014-07-09T11:25:16+00:00","issns":["1744-1609","1744-1595"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Evidence-Based Healthcare","last_mentioned_on":1404904915,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1744-1609.2012.00288.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1744-1609.2012.00288.x\/pdf","pmid":"23173658","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Asia","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"338","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Making evidence more wanted: a systematic review of facilitators to enhance the uptake of evidence from systematic reviews and meta\u2010analyses","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/making-evidence-more-wanted-systematic-review-facilitators-enhance-uptake-evidence-systematic-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6337722,"mean":5.9776361196717,"rank":4683444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":943311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6337722,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146868,"mean":7.8541886604889,"rank":97015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":28237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146868,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":3.9229756097561,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
