The selection process employed can influence the socio-economic composition of the student cohort and this study therefore evaluated whether Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) performance was influenced by school type or area-level Higher Education (HE) participation rates. Methods: MMI performance for all UK applicants was recorded and consent to link performance with socio-economic data was requested using an applicant questionnaire. Station-level and total MMI scores, and offer rates were compared between applicants from non-selective, non-fee-paying schools and from selective and\/or fee-paying schools; and between applicants from each quintile of area-level HE participation. Results: 793 applicants were included in the analysis. MMI performance and offer rates were slightly higher for applicants from non-selective, non-fee-paying schools and\/or from lower HE participation quintiles, but the effects were small and not statistically significant. Conclusions: The MMI did not favour applicants from selective and\/or fee-paying schools, or from areas with high HE participation rates. Work to evaluate whether the relationship between MMI and medical school performance is the same for all sub-groups of students is now required.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041e4","authors":["Celia A.
