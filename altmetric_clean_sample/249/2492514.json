The molecular mechanisms linking cholesterol to neurotoxicity have remained elusive for a long time, but recent data have allowed the identification of functional cholesterol-binding domains in several amyloidogenic proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we analyse the cholesterol-binding properties of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides and the impact of these interactions on amyloid pore formation. We show that although the cholesterol-binding domains of A\u03b2 peptides and of the transmembrane precursor C99 are partially overlapping, they involve distinct amino acid residues so that cholesterol has a greater affinity for A\u03b2 than for C99. Synthetic 22-35 and 25-35 fragments of A\u03b2 retained the ability of the full-length peptide 1-42 to bind cholesterol and to form zinc-sensitive, calcium-permeable amyloid pores in cultured neural cells. Studies with mutant peptides allowed to identify key residues involved in cholesterol binding and channel formation. Cholesterol promoted the insertion of A\u03b2 in the plasma membrane, induced alpha-helical structuration, and forced the peptide to adopt a tilted topology that favoured the oligomerization process. Bexarotene, an amphipathic drug currently considered as a potential candidate medication for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, competed with cholesterol for binding to A\u03b2, and prevented oligomeric channel formation. These studies indicate that it is possible to prevent the generation of neurotoxic oligomers by targeting the cholesterol-binding domain of A\u03b2 peptides. This original strategy could be used for the treatment of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases that involve cholesterol-dependent toxic oligomers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Coralie Di Scala","Henri Chahinian","Nouara Yahi","Nicolas Garmy","Jacques Fantini"],"doi":"10.1021\/bi500373k","first_seen_on":"2014-07-08T10:35:43+00:00","issns":["1520-4995"],"journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1404815680,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25000142?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25000142?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25000142","pubdate":"2014-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Interaction of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptides with cholesterol: mechanistic insights into amyloid pore formation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interaction-alzheimers-%CE%B2amyloid-peptides-cholesterol-mechanistic-insights-amyloid-pore-formation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561630,"mean":6.0798051118097,"rank":3117170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1959715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561630,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150394,"mean":7.8851632722269,"rank":74411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":57697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150394,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6177,"mean":2.5669954663212,"rank":4328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":1100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6177,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":1.3005494505495,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
