During both conditions, the students were asked to demonstrate different techniques in response to an instructor's punching attack. During baseline, the students received no feedback on their responses in either condition. During the intervention phase, the students received differential reinforcement in the form of instructor feedback for each different punching or kicking technique they performed during a session of the drill condition, but no reinforcement was provided for techniques in the sparring condition. Results showed that both students increased the number of different techniques they performed when reinforcement and extinction procedures were conducted during the drill condition, and that this increase in response variability generalized to the sparring condition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8c","authors":["Jay W Harding","David P Wacker","Wendy K Berg","Gary Rick","John F Lee","Harding, Jay W.","Wacker, David P.","Berg, Wendy K.","Rick, Gary","Lee, John F."],"doi":"10.1901\/jaba.2004.37-185","endpage":"195","first_seen_on":"2014-07-08T07:07:52+00:00","issns":["1938-3703","0021-8855"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1404911194,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1284493\/pdf\/15293637.pdf","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1901\/jaba.2004.37-185\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1284493\/pdf\/15293637.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1284493","pmid":"15293637","pubdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"185","subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"PROMOTING RESPONSE VARIABILITY AND STIMULUS GENERALIZATION IN MARTIAL ARTS TRAINING","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/promoting-response-variability-stimulus-generalization-martial-arts-training"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6337722,"mean":5.9776361196717,"rank":2594112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3602573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6337722,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147243,"mean":7.8383989079205,"rank":59568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":82950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147243,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":642,"mean":7.79135725429,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":642,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.9857142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
