We know about plant to plant communication!"],"citation":{"abstract":"Plants emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as a means to warn other plants of impending danger. Nearby plants exposed to the induced VOCs prepare their own defense weapons in response. Accumulated data supports this assertion, yet much of the evidence has been obtained in laboratories under artificial conditions where, for example, a single VOC might be applied at a concentration that plants do not actually experience in nature. Experiments conducted outdoors suggest that communication occurs only within a limited distance from the damaged plants. Thus, the question remains as to whether VOCs work as a single component or a specific blend, and at which concentrations VOCs elicit insect and pathogen defenses in undamaged plants. We discuss these issues based on available literature and our recent work, and propose future directions in this field.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008547","authors":["Hirokazu Ueda","Yukio Kikuta","Kazuhiko Matsuda"],"doi":"10.4161\/psb.18765","first_seen_on":"2014-07-09T14:28:58+00:00","issns":["1559-2324"],"issue":"2","journal":"Plant Signaling & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1493377215,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3405699\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3405699\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3405699","pmid":"22353877","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Horticultural Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"222","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Plant communication: Mediated by individual or blended VOCs?","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plant-communication-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8138092,"mean":6.879675480889,"rank":872304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7253809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8138092,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178501,"mean":7.5264016134456,"rank":22011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":156213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178501,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":735,"mean":1.810514986376,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":735,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.037962962963,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"NP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CoolScienceOTD\/status\/486878940879802368","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2496080],"posted_on":"2014-07-09T14:25:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Cool Science OTD","url":"http:\/\/huffinesinstitute.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000499024672\/ec08d07c58ba6225fe73a890d0b806b7_normal.jpeg","description":"The latest in science, brought to you by the Huffines Institute for Sports Medicine and Human Performance at Texas A&M","id_on_source":"CoolScienceOTD","tweeter_id":"1860890359","geo":{"lt":30.62798,"ln":-96.33441,"country":"US"},"followers":155},"tweet_id":"486878940879802368"}],"news":[{"title":"15 astounding facts about trees","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30387377112&p=1pl&v=1&x=DdcANYFWRN_rRcPLFflzpg","license":"public","citation_ids":[4464963,18258262,405503,2496080,1754673,13002764,418517],"posted_on":"2017-04-28T11:00:15+00:00","summary":"As National Arbor Day draws attention to trees, here's a closer look at how weird and wonderful these pillars of our communities can be.","author":{"name":"Mother Nature Network","url":"http:\/\/www.mnn.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/159\/normal\/image.png?1369925807"}}]}}
