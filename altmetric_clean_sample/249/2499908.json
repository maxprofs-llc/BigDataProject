In computed tomography (CT) images of a 17th century middle-aged male mummy (the Andong mummy), we observed that the abdominal contents had protruded into the right thoracic cavity through the diaphragmatic defect, accompanied by a mediastinal shift to the left. On autopsy, the defect in the right posterolateral aspect of the diaphragm was reconfirmed, as was the herniation of the abdominal organs. The herniated contents included the right lobe of the liver, the pyloric part of the stomach, a part of the greater omentum, and the right colic flexure connecting the superior part of the ascending colon and the right part of the transverse colon. Taking our CT and autopsy results together, this case was diagnosed as the Bochdalek-type CDH. Herein we make the first ever report of a CT-assisted diagnosis of a pre-modern historical case of CDH. Our results show the promising utility of this modality in investigations of mummified human remains archaeologically obtained.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yi-Suk Kim","In Sun Lee","Go-Un Jung","Myeung Ju Kim","Chang Seok Oh","Dong Su Yoo","Won-Joon Lee","Eunju Lee","Soon Chul Cha","Dong Hoon Shin"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0099779","first_seen_on":"2014-07-10T18:42:50+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1463713302,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0099779","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0099779","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0099779?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FPLoSONE+%28PLOS+ONE+Alerts%3A+New+Articles%29","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0099779","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0099779"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0099779.pdf","pmid":"24988465","pubdate":"2014-07-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e99779","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Radiological Diagnosis of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia in 17th Century Korean Mummy","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiological-diagnosis-congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-17th-century-korean-mummy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":36.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":36.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7722452,"mean":6.6241115612059,"rank":215725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7506643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7722452,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176414,"mean":7.4086368918393,"rank":6486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":169923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176414,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109715,"mean":10.264704577356,"rank":5540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":104173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109715,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2649,"mean":15.766879909366,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":2436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2649,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
