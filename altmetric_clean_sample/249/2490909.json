When the number of spectral peaks or single emitters in imaging is limited, the solution of the deconvolution is required to be sparse, and desirable results are obtained using a penalized estimation techniques. We impose sparseness by using penalized regression with a penalty based on the L0-norm, as discussed in earlier work. Several extensions to this approach are presented. Results are demonstrated on pulse identification in endocrine data where the aim is to model the secretion pattern as a sparse series of spikes. An application in single-molecule fluorescence imaging demonstrates the algorithm when applied to two-dimensional data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Johan J. de Rooi"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac500260h","first_seen_on":"2014-07-07T22:32:55+00:00","issns":["0003-2700"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1404772256,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac500260h"],"pmid":"24893114","pubdate":"2014-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Sparse deconvolution in one and two dimensions: Applications in endocrinology and single-molecule fluorescence imaging.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sparse-deconvolution-one-two-dimensions-applications-endocrinology-singlemolecule-fluorescence-imagi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3057029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108993,"mean":7.8849459960366,"rank":72414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":25777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108993,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5069,"mean":2.4216104972376,"rank":2713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5069,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":370,"mean":3.6897506775068,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":370,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
