In this paper, by adopting a hybrid concept of transformation optics and singular media, we report a broadband meta-lens design methodology with ultra-high resolution. The meta-lens is made of subwavelength metal\/air layers, which exhibit singular medium property over a broad band. As a proof of concept, the subwavelength imaging ability is demonstrated over a broad frequency band from 1.5-10 GHz with the resolution varying from 1\/117 to 1\/17 wavelength experimentally.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Su Xu","Yuyu Jiang","Hongyi Xu","Junxia Wang","Shisheng Lin","Hongsheng Chen","Baile Zhang"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep05212","first_seen_on":"2014-06-09T23:35:20+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1402317548,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep05212"],"pmid":"24909738","pubdate":"2014-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied physics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Microwave photonics","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Realization of deep subwavelength resolution with singular media","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/realization-deep-subwavelength-resolution-singular-media"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":2667472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1699978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124901,"mean":7.9164267574062,"rank":61473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":47446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124901,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15807,"mean":13.321162723017,"rank":9296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":4954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15807,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":762,"mean":9.6613429697766,"rank":425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":762,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
