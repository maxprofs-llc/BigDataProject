However, previous studies tend to focus only on specific areas, indicating that application to another area or intervention strategy requires a similar time-consuming simulation. Here, we study the epidemic dynamics of the disease-spread over a commute network, using the Tokyo metropolitan area as an example, in an attempt to elucidate the general properties of epidemic spread over a commute network that could be used for a prediction in any metropolitan area. The model is formulated on the basis of a metapopulation network in which local populations are interconnected by actual commuter flows in the Tokyo metropolitan area and the spread of infection is simulated by an individual-based model. We find that the probability of a global epidemic as well as the final epidemic sizes in both global and local populations, the timing of the epidemic peak, and the time at which the epidemic reaches a local population are mainly determined by the joint distribution of the local population sizes connected by the commuter flows, but are insensitive to geographical or topological structure of the network. Moreover, there is a strong relation between the population size and the time that the epidemic reaches this local population and we are able to determine the reason for this relation as well as its dependence on the commute network structure and epidemic parameters. This study shows that the model based on the connection between the population size classes is sufficient to predict both global and local epidemic dynamics in metropolitan area. Moreover, the clear relation of the time taken by the epidemic to reach each local population can be used as a novel measure for intervention; this enables efficient intervention strategies in each local population prior to the actual arrival.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Kenta Yashima","Akira Sasaki"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0098518","first_seen_on":"2014-06-09T23:54:14+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1479935861,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098518","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0098518","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4048205\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0098518.pdf","pmid":"24905831","pubdate":"2014-06-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e98518","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Epidemic Process over the Commute Network in a Metropolitan Area","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemic-process-commute-network-metropolitan-area"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7729992,"mean":6.6289680453638,"rank":3032829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4641116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7729992,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176632,"mean":7.179117776608,"rank":53122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":122108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176632,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109776,"mean":10.273079335004,"rank":40747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":67538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109776,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2887,"mean":13.758039501039,"rank":1162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2887,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
