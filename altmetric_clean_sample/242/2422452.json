The molecular weight (or polymer chain length) of the linear polymer was controlled by reaction stoichiometry for the 11.5, 17.2, and 24.6 kDa polypeptides, and the highest molecular weight polypeptide was prepared using a sequential addition method to obtain a polypeptide having a molecular weight of 38.6 kDa. These polymers were used to prepare polymer conjugate systems designed to target and deliver an apolipoprotein B (ApoB) siRNA to hepatocyte cells and to help delineate the effect of polymer molecular weight or polymer chain length on siRNA delivery in vivo. A clear trend in increasing potency was found with increasing molecular weight of the polymers examined (at a constant polymer:siRNA (w\/w) ratio), with minimal toxicity found. Furthermore, the biodegradability of these polymer conjugates was examined and demonstrates the potential of these systems as siRNA delivery vectors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b89","authors":["Barrett SE","Abrams MT","Burke R","Carr BA","Crocker LS","Garbaccio RM","Howell BJ","Kemp EA","Kowtoniuk RA","Latham AH","Leander KR","Leone AM","Patel M","Pechenov S","Pudvah NT","Riley S","Sepp-Lorenzino L","Walsh ES","Williams JM","Colletti SL"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijpharm.2014.03.011","first_seen_on":"2014-06-10T06:35:52+00:00","issns":["0378-5173"],"journal":"International Journal of Pharmaceutics","last_mentioned_on":1418763610,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijpharm.2014.03.011","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24607208","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24607208?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24607208","pubdate":"2014-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"An in vivo evaluation of amphiphilic, biodegradable peptide copolymers as siRNA delivery agents.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vivo-evaluation-amphiphilic-biodegradable-peptide-copolymers-sirna-delivery-agents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4627399,"mean":5.419528273356,"rank":565864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4059700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4627399,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108917,"mean":7.9451468838371,"rank":16384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":92460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108917,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":751,"mean":1.77852,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":751,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":2.3085714285714,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
