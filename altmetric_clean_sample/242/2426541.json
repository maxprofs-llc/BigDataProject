We analyzed anthocyanin composition and the expression of elements encoding anthocyanin and flavonols biosynthesis underlying different medium pH values by using three different leave color type cultivars. HPLC analysis demonstrated that high medium pH values treatment induced a dramatic decrease in the concentration of cyaniding in crabapple leaves. Conversely, the high medium pH values induced up-regulation of the content of flavones and flavonols, suggesting that low pH treatment-induced anthocyanin accumulation. Quantitative real time PCR experiment showed the expression level of anthocyanidin synthase (McANS) and uridine diphosphate glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (McUFGT) was up-regulated by low pH values treatment, and high medium pH value treatment up-regulate the transcription level of flavonol synthase (McFLS). Meanwhile, several MYB TFs have been suggested in the regulation of pH responses. These results strongly indicate that the low pH treatment-induced anthocyanin accumulation is mediated by the variation of mRNA transcription of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yanchen Zhang","Jie Zhang","Tingting Song","Jinyan Li","Ji Tian","Kaina Jin","Yuncong Yao"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0097904","first_seen_on":"2014-06-11T12:54:24+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1402482453,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24914811?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24914811","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Low Medium pH Value Enhances Anthocyanin Accumulation in Malus Crabapple Leaves.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-medium-ph-value-enhances-anthocyanin-accumulation-malus-crabapple-leaves"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7907886,"mean":6.6924917881274,"rank":4146949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2205291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7907886,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177112,"mean":7.2307698448998,"rank":83458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":73264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177112,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111160,"mean":10.337405554206,"rank":64242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":35743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111160,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2890,"mean":13.826157840083,"rank":1746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":794,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2890,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
