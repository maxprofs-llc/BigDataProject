However, continuation phase patient costs still represented 89% and 77% of the 2-month average national income in the respective countries. Direct travel costs in some settings were kept low by local delivery system features such as community treatment observation. Lost productivity and costs for supplementary foods remained significant. <\/sec> <sec id=\"st4\"> <title>CONCLUSIONS<\/title> Although it is not a straightforward exercise to determine the exact magnitude of likely savings, a shorter regimen would reduce out-of-pocket expenses incurred by patients in the most recent 2 months of the continuation phase and allow an earlier return to productive activities. <\/sec>","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007a18","authors":["Gospodarevskaya, E.","Gospodarevskaya E","Tulloch O","Bunga C","Ferdous S","Jonas A","Islam S","Rahman M","Hussain MA","Haque MN","Egwaga S","Gardiner E","PrayGod G","Islam MA","Mann GH","Wells WA","Squire SB","E.
