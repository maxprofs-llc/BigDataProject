T-lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of 90 ITP patients in the active phase and 59 normal controls were detected by flow cytometry. ITP patients were treated with a conventional dose of corticosteroids, and therapeutic response was evaluated after 3 months. The level of CD4 T lymphocytes (35.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.6%) and natural killer cells (13.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.1%) in the active ITP patients was lower compared with the control group (40.4\u200a\u00b1\u200a3.7% and 23.2\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.1%, respectively, P\u200a<\u200a0.05 for both). The level of CD8 T lymphocytes (30.11\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.50%) in ITP showed a significantly wider distribution than that in the normal controls (25.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a5.91%, P\u200a<\u200a0.05). Additionally, the patients with higher levels of CD4 T cells were less likely to respond to corticosteroids (r\u200a=\u200a0.69, P\u200a=\u200a0.04). The detection of immunocyte subsets might be helpful for the ITP patients concerning their diagnosis and determination of therapeutic outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd4","authors":["Wei Rong","Zhang Yan-Xiang","Xu Shan-Shan","Shi Ju-Mei"],"doi":"10.1097\/mbc.0000000000000155","first_seen_on":"2014-06-10T11:06:28+00:00","issns":["1473-5733","0957-5235"],"journal":"Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis","last_mentioned_on":1403489551,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24911458?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/bloodcoagulation\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Lymphocyte_subsets_in_primary_immune.99180.aspx"],"pmid":"24911458","pubdate":"2014-06-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Lymphocyte subsets in primary immune thrombocytopenia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lymphocyte-subsets-primary-immune-thrombocytopenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770902,"mean":5.7220129992239,"rank":3192586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1390274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770902,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116023,"mean":7.9959521297686,"rank":73024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":38192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116023,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":635,"mean":0.97876971608833,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":635,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.2679487179487,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/status\/476304700045000704","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2423370],"posted_on":"2014-06-10T10:07:44+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":221},"tweet_id":"476304700045000704"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BloodCoagFibrin\/status\/480896149922930688","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2423370],"posted_on":"2014-06-23T02:12:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Blood Coag & Fibrin","url":"http:\/\/www.bloodcoagulation.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2436101481\/gxkzmqfq7cf9ekh29zp4_normal.jpeg","description":"Devoted to publishing significant developments worldwide in the field of blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, thrombosis, platelets and the kininogen-kinin system.","id_on_source":"BloodCoagFibrin","tweeter_id":"718776926","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":175},"tweet_id":"480896149922930688"}]}}
