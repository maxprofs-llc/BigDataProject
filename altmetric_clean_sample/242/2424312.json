In Africa, the distribution of different species of Rickettsia in their tick vectors is poorly studied. We have collected 1169 hard ticks from 5 different species in the northern Senegal, close to the Saharan border. In a far northern collection site, corresponding to the Rickettsia africae distribution area, we collected three Amblyomma variegatum ticks infected by R. africae. Rickettsia africae was also identified in a Hyalomma marginatum rufipes tick, which may represent the secondary host for the pathogen. Rickettsia aeschlimannii was identified in H. m. rufipes, Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, and Hyalomma impeltatum ticks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b72","authors":["Masse Sambou","Ngor Faye","Hubert Bass\u00e8ne","Georges Diatta","Didier Raoult","Oleg Mediannikov"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ttbdis.2014.04.002","first_seen_on":"2014-06-10T14:51:28+00:00","issns":["1877-9603"],"journal":"Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1402411847,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24908548"],"pmid":"24908548","pubdate":"2014-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["parasitology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Identification of rickettsial pathogens in ixodid ticks in northern Senegal.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-rickettsial-pathogens-ixodid-ticks-northern-senegal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3555442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107831,"mean":7.7016910692759,"rank":82811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107831,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":410,"mean":1.9272420537897,"rank":329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":410,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.198,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
