Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of a single surgeon's experience from 2009 to 2013. Results: Twenty-eight children 11-18 years of age (mean, 15.5 years) with a mean body mass index of 18.9\u00b13\u2009kg\/m(2) underwent single-incision laparoscopic ileocecectomy for Crohn's disease. Mean operative time was 86.5\u00b125.9 minutes (range, 56-166 minutes). There were no extra ports placed or conversions to open surgery. Five children (18%) were on parenteral nutrition at time of surgery, 14 (50%) were on steroids, and 9 (32%) were on tumor necrotic factor inhibitors. A stapled extracorporeal anastomosis was performed in all children. Complications included abscess (n=4), small bowel obstruction (n=3), superficial wound infection (n=3), and small bowel perforation (n=1). Some patients had more than one complication. Of those with complications, 5 (56%) were on steroids, 5 (56%) were on tumor necrotic factor inhibitors, and 1 patient was on both. The perforation occurred at a point of adhesiolysis also involved with Crohn's disease. There were no anastomotic leaks. Median follow-up was 17 months (range, 1-47 months). Conclusions: Single-incision laparoscopic ileocecectomy is safe and feasible in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e17","authors":["Nicole E Sharp","Priscilla Thomas","Shawn D St Peter"],"doi":"10.1089\/lap.2013.0517","first_seen_on":"2014-06-12T10:13:30+00:00","issns":["1557-9034"],"journal":"Journal of Laparoendoscopic & Advanced Surgical Techniques","last_mentioned_on":1402567956,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24918784?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24918784","pubdate":"2014-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Single-Incision Laparoscopic Ileocecectomy in Children with Crohn's Disease.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/singleincision-laparoscopic-ileocecectomy-children-crohns-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3908982,"mean":5.0142013956037,"rank":3126596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":88900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3908982,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97489,"mean":7.5237958413262,"rank":77661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97489,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186,"mean":0.66675675675676,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.85,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
