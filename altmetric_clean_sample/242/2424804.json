The effects of arnica C30 on pain and postoperative recovery after total abdominal hysterectomy were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, controlled study. Of 93 women entered into the study, 20 did not complete protocol treatment: nine were excluded because they failed to comply with the protocol, nine had their operations cancelled or changed within 24 h and two had to be withdrawn because of the recurrence of previously chronic painful conditions. Those who did not complete protocol treatment were equally divided between the arnica (nine patients) and placebo groups (11 patients). 73 patients completed the study, of whom 35 received placebo and 38 received arnica C30. The placebo group had a greater median age and the arnica group had slightly longer operations; nevertheless, no significant difference between the two groups could be demonstrated. We conclude that arnica in homoeopathic potency had no effect on postoperative recovery in the context of our study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ee5","authors":["O Hart","M A Mullee","G Lewith","J Miller","Hart, O","Mullee, M A","Lewith, G","Miller, J"],"first_seen_on":"2014-06-10T19:05:42+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0141-0768"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1420032755,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1296141\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9068434"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1296141\/pdf\/jrsocmed00043-0019.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1296141","pmid":"9068434","pubdate":"1997-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Royal Society of Medicine Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"73","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of homoeopathic arnica C30 for pain and infection after total abdominal hysterectomy.","type":"article","volume":"90","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/doubleblind-placebocontrolled-randomized-clinical-trial-homoeopathic-arnica-c30-pain-infection-after-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8031452,"mean":6.80952670918,"rank":541780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7488585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8031452,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178301,"mean":7.311216365676,"rank":14543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":163725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178301,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1389,"mean":14.222737752161,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1389,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":10.799,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HomeopathyNo\/status\/498916067419639808","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2424804],"posted_on":"2014-08-11T19:37:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Homeopathy No Worky","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/493956752191135746\/PmVShbC3_normal.jpeg","description":"Homeopathy is the biggest snake oil medical scam since actual snake oil.
