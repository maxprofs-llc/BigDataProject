In vivo, distribution of L-selectin and cell surface levels determine the tethering efficiency and rolling velocity of leukocytes, respectively. Treatment of naive lymphocytes with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induces rapid ectodomain proteolytic down-regulation (shedding) of surface L-selectin via a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway. In an attempt to isolate proteins that are involved in regulating L-selectin expression, an affinity column was constructed using the 17-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin. Affinity purification of extracts from lymphocytes, pre-treated with or without PMA, allowed identification of proteins that interact with the affinity column under one condition but not the other. By using this approach, members of the Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin family of proteins were found to interact specifically with the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin. Moesin from PMA-stimulated lymphocytes, but not from unstimulated lymphocytes, bound to L-selectin tail. In contrast, ezrin from unstimulated or PMA-stimulated lymphocytes associated with L-selectin tail with equal affinity. Furthermore, the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220 significantly reduced the interaction of moesin, but not ezrin, with L-selectin. Alanine mutations of membrane-proximal basic amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin identified arginine 357 as a critical residue for both ezrin and moesin interaction. Finally, BIAcore affinity analysis confirmed that N-terminal moesin interacts specifically with L-selectin cytoplasmic tail, with relatively high affinity (K(d) approximately 40 nm). Based on these findings, although moesin and ezrin bind to a similar region of the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin, moesin binding is dependent on PKC activation, which suggests that ezrin and moesin are regulated differently in lymphocytes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Aleksandar Ivetic","J\u00fcrgen Deka","Anne Ridley","Ann Ager"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m109460200","first_seen_on":"2014-12-24T12:12:18+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1419423022,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M109460200"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/277\/3\/2321.full.pdf","pmid":"11706008","pubdate":"2002-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The Cytoplasmic Tail of L-selectin Interacts with Members of the Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) Family of Proteins CELL ACTIVATION-DEPENDENT BINDING OF MOESIN BUT NOT EZRIN","type":"article","volume":"277","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytoplasmic-tail-lselectin-interacts-members-ezrinradixinmoesin-erm-family-proteins-cell-activationd"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":2412017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1665500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155500,"mean":8.252992263616,"rank":78889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":58107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155500,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30644,"mean":2.5499216786868,"rank":19188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":7439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30644,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":3.0394183976261,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
