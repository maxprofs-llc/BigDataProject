The interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling pathway is of great importance in the pathogenesis of AR. However, how the signaling molecules in this pathway are regulated, particularly through microRNAs (miRNAs), remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the regulatory role and mechanism of miRNA-143 (miR-143) in IL-13-induced inflammatory cytokine and mucus production in nasal epithelial cells (NECs) from AR patients. Our results showed that forced expression of miR-143 significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), eotaxin and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) in IL-13-stimulated NECs. Moreover, we confirmed that miR-143 directly targeted and significantly suppressed IL-13 receptor \u03b11 chain (IL13R\u03b11) gene expression. This study thus suggests that miR-143 regulation of IL-13-induced inflammatory cytokine and mucus production in NECs from AR patients probably partly depends on inhibition of IL13R\u03b11. Therefore, the IL13R\u03b11 signaling pathway may be a potential target for the prevention and treatment of AR by miR-143.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Yaoshu Teng","Ruxin Zhang","Chunhui Liu","Lingling Zhou","Hong Wang","Wenjie Zhuang","Yu Huang","Zhicong Hong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2014.12.058","first_seen_on":"2014-12-23T21:14:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2104"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1429115217,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25529447?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25529447","pubdate":"2014-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"miR-143 inhibits interleukin-13-induced inflammatory cytokine and mucus production in nasal epithelial cells from allergic rhinitis patients by targeting IL13R\u03b11.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir143-inhibits-interleukin13induced-inflammatory-cytokine-mucus-production-nasal-epithelial-cells-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5000595,"mean":5.9176901672108,"rank":2303209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2570916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5000595,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175525,"mean":8.1257059547414,"rank":73158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":96761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175525,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6898,"mean":2.4861270117442,"rank":4572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":2255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6898,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170,"mean":1.7359644970414,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
