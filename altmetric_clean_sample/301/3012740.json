Awareness about various clinical features of acute and delayed transfusion reactions with an ability to assess the serious reactions on time can lead to a better prognosis. Evidence-based medicine has changed today's scenario of clinical practice to decrease adverse transfusion reactions. New evidence-based algorithms of transfusion and improved haemovigilance lead to avoidance of unnecessary transfusions perioperatively. The recognition of adverse events under anaesthesia is always challenging. The unnecessary blood transfusions can be avoided with better blood conservation techniques during surgery and with anaesthesia techniques that reduce blood loss. Better and newer blood screening methods have decreased the infectious complications to almost negligible levels. With universal leukoreduction of red blood cells (RBCs), selection of potential donors such as use of male donors only plasma and restriction of RBC storage, most of the non-infectious complications can be avoided.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003d82","authors":["Sandeep Sahu"," Hemlata","Anupam Verma"],"doi":"10.4103\/0019-5049.144650","first_seen_on":"2014-12-24T11:02:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0019-5049"],"issue":"5","journal":"Indian Journal of Anaesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1419418934,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25535415?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25535415","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Adverse events related to blood transfusion.","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adverse-events-related-blood-transfusion-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691387,"mean":5.4355271855819,"rank":3211028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":892284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691387,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155496,"mean":8.2704565420112,"rank":104371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":33605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155496,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216,"mean":1.0851162790698,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.39285714285714,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
