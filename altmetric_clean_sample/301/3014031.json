In\u00a0stark contrast to PIP inositol head-group phosphorylation, changes in phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipid\u00a0acyl chains in cancer have remained ill-defined. Here, we apply a mass-spectrometry-based method capable of unbiased high-throughput identification and quantification of cellular PI acyl chain composition. Using this approach, we find that PI lipid chains represent a cell-specific fingerprint and are unperturbed by serum-mediated signaling in contrast to the inositol head group. We find that mutation of Trp53 results in PIs containing reduced-length fatty acid moieties. Our results suggest that the anchoring tails of lipid second messengers form an additional layer of PIP signaling in cancer that operates independently of PTEN\/PI3-kinase activity but is instead linked to p53.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"52d545303cf058dd068b4567","authors":["Naguib A","Bencze G","Engle DD","Chio II","Herzka T","Watrud K","Bencze S","Tuveson DA","Pappin DJ","Trotman LC","Adam Naguib","Gyula Bencze","Dannielle\u00a0D.
