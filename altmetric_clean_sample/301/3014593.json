Pt-CHH1 was cloned from eyestalk, whereas Pt-CHH2 was cloned from thoracic ganglia. Sequence and structure analyses of Pt-CHH1 and Pt-CHH2 suggest that they may be generated from alternative splicing. Tissue distribution showed that transcript of Pt-CHH1 was only detected in eyestalk, while transcript of Pt-CHH2 was observed in several extra-eyestalk tissues. The transcript levels of Pt-CHH1 and Pt-CHH2 during molting and ovarian development were determined using qPCR. In molting process, level of Pt-CHH1 in eyestalk increased from stage A (postmolt), and to significant higher at stage C (intermolt), then decreased during premolt (D0-D4). In ovarian development, level of Pt-CHH1 in eyestalk decreased from previtellogenic stage (II), and to significant lower at mature stage (IV). The expression patterns of Pt-CHH2 in thoracic ganglia and Y-organ were distinct from that of Pt-CHH1 in eyestalk. The combined results suggest that Pt-CHH1 may be involved in inhibition of molting and ovarian development, whereas Pt-CHH2 may have other physiological functions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003761","authors":["Xi Xie"],"doi":"10.2108\/zs140053","first_seen_on":"2014-12-24T23:32:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0289-0003"],"issue":"12","journal":"Zoological Science (VSP International Science Publishers)","last_mentioned_on":1419463920,"links":["http:\/\/www.bioone.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2108\/zs140053?utm_content=bufferea846&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer&"],"pmid":"25483792","pubdate":"2014-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Molecular Cloning of Two Structure Variants of Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone (CHH) from the Swimming Crab (Portunus trituberculatus), and Their Gene Expression During Molting and Ovarian Development.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-cloning-two-structure-variants-crustacean-hyperglycemic-hormone-chh-swimming-crab-iportunu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3211069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":892435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155499,"mean":8.2530527337974,"rank":104346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":33608,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155499,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":414,"mean":2.1685859564165,"rank":281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":414,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":14.303571428571,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BioOneNews\/status\/547897512112427009","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3014593],"posted_on":"2014-12-24T23:32:00+00:00","author":{"name":"BioOne","url":"http:\/\/bioonepublishing.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/899632542671917056\/ahx8jIT4_normal.jpg","description":"BioOne is a nonprofit publisher committed to making research more accessible.
