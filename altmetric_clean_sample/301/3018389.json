In a Markov cohort cost-effectiveness analysis, we found that aspirin cost less and saved more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than warfarin in all age groups. Cost per QALY gained by aspirin was $24,506.20 at age of 55 and $47,148.10 at the age of 85 following THA and $15,117.20 and $24,458.10 after TKA, which were greater than warfarin. In patients undergoing THA\/TKA without prior VTE, aspirin is more cost-effective prophylactic agent than warfarin. Warfarin might be a better prophylaxis in TKA patients with high probability of VTE and very low probability of bleeding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Mostafavi Tabatabaee R","Rasouli MR","Maltenfort MG","Parvizi J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arth.2014.08.018","first_seen_on":"2014-12-27T06:07:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0883-5403"],"issue":"","journal":"The Journal of Arthroplasty","last_mentioned_on":1419660394,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25534862\/?i=14&from=knee"],"pmid":"25534862","pubdate":"2014-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Cost-Effective Prophylaxis Against Venous Thromboembolism After Total Joint Arthroplasty: Warfarin Versus Aspirin.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costeffective-prophylaxis-against-venous-thromboembolism-after-total-joint-arthroplasty-warfarin-ver-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3211069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":892467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155742,"mean":8.2835728420905,"rank":104577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":33641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155742,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":683,"mean":2.0347947214076,"rank":431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":683,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":2.0781818181818,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Knee_Surgeon\/status\/548721581183090690","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3018389],"posted_on":"2014-12-27T06:06:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Christopher Vertullo","url":"http:\/\/www.knee-surgeon.net.au","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/445529873549783040\/jqG9u-h__normal.jpeg","description":"Specialist Orthopaedic Knee Surgeon, Knee Surgery Researcher, Youth Sport Injury Prevention Advocate","id_on_source":"Knee_Surgeon","tweeter_id":"296478489","geo":{"lt":-28.00029,"ln":153.43088,"country":"AU"},"followers":942},"tweet_id":"548721581183090690"}]}}
