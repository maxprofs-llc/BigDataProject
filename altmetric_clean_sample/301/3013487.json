Here, we used molecular, cytogenetic and genomic approaches to analyse rRNA gene activity in two sibling T. mirus plants (33A and 33B) with widely different rRNA gene dosages. Plant 33B had ~400 rRNA genes at the D-genome locus, which is typical for T. mirus, accounting for ~25% of total rDNA. We observed characteristic expression dominance of T. dubius-origin genes in all organs. Its sister plant 33A harboured a homozygous macrodeletion that reduced the number of T. dubius-origin genes to about 70 copies (~4% of total rDNA). It showed biparental rDNA expression in root, flower and callus, but not in leaf where D-genome rDNA dominance was maintained. There was upregulation of minor rDNA variants in some tissues. The RNA polymerase I promoters of reactivated T. porrifolius-origin rRNA genes showed reduced DNA methylation, mainly at symmetrical CG and CHG nucleotide motifs. We hypothesise that active, decondensed rDNA units are most likely to be deleted via recombination. The silenced homeologs could be used as a 'first reserve' to ameliorate mutational damage and contribute to evolutionary success of polyploids. Deletion and reactivation cycles may lead to bidirectional homogenisation of rRNA arrays in the long term.Heredity advance online publication, 24 December 2014; doi:10.1038\/hdy.2014.111.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029dd","authors":["E Dobe\u0161ov\u00e1","H Malinsk\u00e1","R Maty\u00e1\u0161ek","A R Leitch","D E Soltis","P S Soltis","A Kova&rcaron;\u00edk"],"doi":"10.1038\/hdy.2014.111","first_seen_on":"2014-12-24T13:10:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0018-067X","1365-2540"],"journal":"Heredity","last_mentioned_on":1421153165,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/hdy\/rss\/aop\/~3\/-c4FKWg8NFc\/hdy.2014.111","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/hdy\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/hdy2014111a.html"],"pmid":"25537492","pubdate":"2014-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary biology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Silenced rRNA genes are activated and substitute for partially eliminated active homeologs in the recently formed allotetraploid, Tragopogon mirus (Asteraceae)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/silenced-rrna-genes-activated-substitute-partially-eliminated-active-homeologs-recently-formed-allot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":455859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4267954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157078,"mean":8.3120239245721,"rank":21228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":135488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157078,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":834,"mean":6.1414069627851,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":834,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":9.825,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Silenced rRNA genes are activated and substitute for partially eliminated active homeologs in the recently formed allotetraploid Tragopogon mirus Asteraceae","url":"http:\/\/www.bioportfolio.com\/news\/article\/2178168\/Silenced-rRNA-genes-are-activated-and-substitute-for-partially-eliminated-active-homeologs.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[3013487],"posted_on":"2014-12-24T12:04:01+00:00","summary":"","author":{"name":"Bioportfolio","url":"http:\/\/www.bioportfolio.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/821\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-12-11_at_16.36.54.png?1449851849"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HeredityJournal\/status\/554982716958339073","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3013487],"posted_on":"2015-01-13T12:46:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Heredity","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/hdy\/index.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/796336390686515200\/KUISYPV__normal.jpg","description":"The Genetics Society's journal covering a broad range of general genetics research.
