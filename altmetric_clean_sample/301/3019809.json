This aim of this study was to empirically examine and compare an extended internalising spectrum model with a categorical framework model implied by the current nosological structure. Responses to an online survey from a community sample (n = 518) were analysed to compare the fit of six alternative models of the relationship between sexual problems, depressive and anxiety disorders, separately for men and women. The best model for women (n = 336) was a dimensional spectrum model that included sexual arousal, orgasm and pain difficulties in the internalising spectrum. The results for men (n = 182) were less clear-cut: there were apparent categorical relationships for a small group (n = 8), and the spectrum model showed a good fit for 96% of the sample. These findings are consistent with a nosology that maintains discrete disorders and diagnostic chapters while recognising the relationships between them, as in the new structure of the DSM-5. As such, this study offers further evidence that there are dimensional relationships between sexual problems and depressive and anxiety disorders, which should be explicitly recognised in diagnostic systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000152b","authors":["Forbes MK","Baillie AJ","Schniering CA","Miriam K.
