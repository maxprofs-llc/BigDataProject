We propose that the abstract structural properties of a causal system, in addition to people's content and mechanism knowledge, influence decisions about how to intervene. In Experiment 1, participants preferred to intervene at specific locations (immediate causes, root causes) in a causal chain regardless of which content variables occupied those positions. In Experiment 2, participants were more likely to intervene on root causes versus immediate causes when they were presented with a long-term goal versus a short-term goal. These results show that the structural properties of a causal system can guide the design of interventions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003781","authors":["Edwards, Brian J.","Burnett, Russell C.","Keil, Frank C."],"doi":"10.1111\/cogs.12210","endpage":"1924","first_seen_on":"2014-12-25T10:11:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1551-6709","0364-0213"],"issue":"8","journal":"Cognitive Science","last_mentioned_on":1419502260,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cogs.12210\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cogs.12210\/pdf","pmid":"25530356","pubdate":"2014-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Neuroscience","Arts and Humanities"],"startpage":"1912","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Effects of Causal Structure on Decisions About Where to Intervene on Causal Systems","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-causal-structure-decisions-about-intervene-causal-systems"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6342860,"mean":5.9783001154528,"rank":5399316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6342860,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197998,"mean":7.9372775042047,"rank":155891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197998,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":499,"mean":6.9101646586345,"rank":464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":499,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.9772727272727,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
