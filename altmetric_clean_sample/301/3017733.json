A 72-year-old woman with an ileocecal neuroendocrine tumor underwent whole-body In pentetreotide scintigraphy for exclusion of distant metastases. Planar scintigraphy demonstrated marked tracer uptake in the ileocecal region and intense focal tracer accumulation within the neck. SPECT\/CT demonstrated a space-occupying lesion at the carotid bifurcation. Histopathological evaluation revealed carotid chemodectoma. SPECT\/CT is a valuable tool for the evaluation and precise anatomical localization of tracer uptake. In addition, other benign or malignant pathologies accumulating In pentetreotide may mimic neuroendocrine tumor metastases and should be considered particularly in unusual localizations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Wisotzki C","Jacobsen F","Salamon J","Derlin T"],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0b013e3182a20d78","first_seen_on":"2014-12-26T19:50:54+00:00","issns":["0363-9762"],"issue":"","journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1419623419,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24097001?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24097001","pubdate":"2013-10-08T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Synchronous Ileocecal Neuroendocrine Tumor and Carotid Chemodectoma: Diagnosis by 111In Pentetreotide SPECT\/CT.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synchronous-ileocecal-neuroendocrine-tumor-carotid-chemodectoma-diagnosis-111in-pentetreotide-spectc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3799415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155522,"mean":8.2462750882519,"rank":121896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155522,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1880,"mean":0.84591378392762,"rank":1307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1880,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":0.97444444444444,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/status\/548566495777660929","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3017733],"posted_on":"2014-12-26T19:50:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24805},"tweet_id":"548566495777660929"}]}}
