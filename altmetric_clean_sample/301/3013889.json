There was considerable heterogeneity between the EALs used and the study designs and a narrative summary of the findings were presented. Working length measurement was compared using three different methods: distance to the radiographic apex in teeth undergoing root canal treatment, (11 studies); concordance between the comparative measurements with EAL and radiography, (two studies); distance to specific anatomic apical reference points evaluated after tooth extraction (four studies)ded. The body of evidence was once again assessed as of low quality.ConclusionsWithin the limitations of this review, it is suggested that working length determination by using EAL may perform better than radiography alone.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f40","authors":["Isabel Mello"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.ebd.6401066","endpage":"120","first_seen_on":"2014-12-24T16:02:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1462-0049","1476-5446"],"journal":"Evidence-Based Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1421150528,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ebd\/journal\/v15\/n4\/full\/6401066a.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_The_BDJ"],"pmid":"25522947","pubdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"120","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Use of electronic apex locators may improve determination of working length","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electronic-apex-locators-improve-determination-working-length-abstracted"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":3255434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":879204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157076,"mean":8.3240203342353,"rank":106589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":32868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157076,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":348,"mean":4.5791527377522,"rank":289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":348,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":4.5791666666667,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/The_BDJ\/status\/547784164708483072","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3013889],"posted_on":"2014-12-24T16:01:36+00:00","author":{"name":"British Dental Jnl","url":"http:\/\/www.bdj.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/751009708610322432\/Bw_QAAlK_normal.jpg","description":"The flagship journal of @TheBDA, the British Dental Journal connects research, practice, ideas and opinion in dentistry","id_on_source":"The_BDJ","tweeter_id":"480366538","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":19441},"tweet_id":"547784164708483072"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gary_takacs\/status\/547787311824773120","license":"datasift","rt":["The_BDJ"],"citation_ids":[3013889],"posted_on":"2014-12-24T16:14:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Gary Takacs","url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/UHEdNF","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1358452235\/GaryTakacs_smallest_normal.jpg","description":"Gary's passion is helping #dentists create a ROCKING practice that provides personal, professional & financial success!
