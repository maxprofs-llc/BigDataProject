Age is not considered to be a contraindication for breast-conserving treatment, but retrospective studies have indicated that elderly patients are less likely to be treated conservatively. In the present study, survival, QOL and treatment preference have been investigated in a multicentre, randomised clinical trial of elderly patients with early breast cancer undergoing mastectomy or tumour excision plus tamoxifen. Eligible patients were aged 70 years or more and had histologically- or cytologically-confirmed operable breast cancer. A QOL questionnaire consisting of 36 items was constructed covering 9 scales assessing different QOL domains. Patients completed their assessment between 2 and 12 months after randomisation. 136 patients (65 in the mastectomy arm and 71 in the local excision arm) from six centres filled out a QOL form during the first year of follow-up. No significant difference in the duration of survival between the two treatment arms was observed when including patients included in the QOL sub-study (P=0.33). Patients undergoing tumour excision and tamoxifen did not differ from those undergoing mastectomy in terms of fatigue, emotional functioning, fear of recurrence, social support, physical functioning and leisure time activities. However, conservatively treated patients reported fewer arm problems (P=0.04) and a shift, although borderline significant, in the direction of a benefit in body image (P=0.06). As QOL seems to be better after conservative treatment, such treatment is to be preferred in both elderly and younger patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e9a","authors":["J.C.J.M de Haes","D Curran","N.K Aaronson","I.S Fentiman"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0959-8049(03)00149-7","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T05:54:15+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["09598049","0959-8049"],"issue":"7","journal":"European Journal of Cancer (1965)","last_mentioned_on":1174995900,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0959-8049(03)00149-7"],"pmid":"12706363","pubdate":"2003-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Quality of life in breast cancer patients aged over 70 years, participating in the EORTC 10850 randomised clinical trial","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quality-life-breast-cancer-patients-aged-70-years-participating-eortc-10850-randomised-clinical-tria-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7763031,"mean":6.6351825302687,"rank":1897956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4823755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7763031,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98648,"mean":11.062026275508,"rank":28921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":68853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98648,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1888,"mean":4.8620434552199,"rank":443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1888,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":2.8866666666667,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
