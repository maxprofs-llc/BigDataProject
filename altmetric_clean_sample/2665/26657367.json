The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of a 12-week the Ballistic Six upper-extremity plyometric training program on upper-body explosive power, endurance, and reaction time in pediatric overhead athletes. Twenty-eight female pediatric volleyball players participated in the study. The participants were randomly divided into 2 study groups: an intervention group (upper-extremity plyometric training in addition to the volleyball training; n = 14) and a control group (the volleyball training only; n = 14). All the participants were assessed before and after a 12-week training program for upper-body power, strength and endurance, and reaction time. Statistical comparison was performed using an analysis of variance test. Comparisons showed that after a 12-week training program, the Ballistic Six upper-body plyometric training program resulted in more improvements in an overhead medicine ball throwing distance and a push-up performance, as well as greater improvements in the reaction time in the nonthrowing arm when compared with control training. In addition, a 12-week training program was found to be effective in achieving improvements in the reaction time in the throwing arm for both groups similarly. Compared with regular training, upper-body plyometric training resulted in additional improvements in upper-body power and strength and endurance among pediatric volleyball players. The findings of the study provide a basis for developing training protocols for pediatric volleyball players.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Turgut, Elif","Cinar-Medeni, Ozge","Colakoglu, Filiz F.","Baltaci, Gul"],"doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0000000000002060","first_seen_on":"2017-09-27T16:55:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1064-8011","1533-4287"],"journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1506605664,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/publishahead\/_Ballistic_Six__Upper_Extremity_Plyometric.95744.aspx?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/9000\/00000\/_Ballistic_Six__Upper_Extremity_Plyometric.95744.pdf","pmid":"28945640","pubdate":"2017-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"\u201cBallistic Six\u201d Upper-Extremity Plyometric Training for the Pediatric Volleyball Players","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/_Ballistic_Six__Upper_Extremity_Plyometric.95744.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ballistic-six-upperextremity-plyometric-training-pediatric-volleyball-players"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":0.5,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":4523158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2357849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114159,"mean":11.49746638869,"rank":60963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":41195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114159,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3923,"mean":16.290596124426,"rank":3226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3923,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":6.1755102040816,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Sports and Recreations":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/childrenssports\/statuses\/913084612057944065","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26657367],"posted_on":"2017-09-27T16:55:10+00:00","author":{"name":"ChildrensSports","url":"http:\/\/www.childrensomaha.org\/sportsphysicaltherapy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/734766194058756096\/qYLQ9ZYr_normal.jpg","description":"Helping to safely return kids to sports while preventing injuries.
