Here we quantify the difference between a flat surface and a cylindrical microjet in terms of the energy-dependent information depth of the XPS experiment and in terms of the simulated photoelectron intensities using solutions of pure water and of 1 mol L(-1) NaI as examples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Giorgia Olivieri","Krista M.
