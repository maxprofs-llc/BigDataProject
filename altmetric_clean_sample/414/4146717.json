We investigated a prominent voltage-dependent, cation-selective, and calcium-activated vacuolar ion conductance of 320 pS (yeast vacuolar conductance, YVC1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we report on a gene, the deduced product of which possesses significant homology to the ion channel of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family. By using a combination of gene deletion and re-expression with direct patch clamping of the yeast vacuolar membrane, we show that this yeast TRP-like gene is necessary for the YVC1 conductance. In physiological conditions, tens of micromolar cytoplasmic Ca(2+) activates the YVC1 current carried by cations including Ca(2+) across the vacuolar membrane. Immunodetection of a tagged YVC1 gene product indicates that YVC1 is primarily localized in the vacuole and not other intracellular membranes. Thus we have identified the YVC1 vacuolar\/lysosomal cation-channel gene. This report has implications for the function of TRP channels in other organisms and the possible molecular identification of vacuolar\/lysosomal ion channels in other eukaryotes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Palmer, C P","Zhou, X L","Lin, J","Loukin, S H","Kung, C","Saimi, Y"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.141036198","first_seen_on":"2015-06-13T14:48:40+00:00","issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"14","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1324605047,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11427713"],"pmcid":"PMC35422","pmid":"11427713","pubdate":"2001-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"A TRP homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae forms an intracellular Ca(2+)-permeable channel in the yeast vacuolar membrane.","type":"article","volume":"98","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trp-homolog-saccharomyces-cerevisiae-forms-intracellular-ca2permeable-channel-yeast-vacuolar-membran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4002357,"mean":5.0339744892175,"rank":918780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2531230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4002357,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110849,"mean":6.8652953097651,"rank":30858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":77228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110849,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35487,"mean":14.046474550476,"rank":14057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":14534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35487,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":919,"mean":18.108348583878,"rank":461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":919,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
