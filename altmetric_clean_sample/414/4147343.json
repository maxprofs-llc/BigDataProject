The Study of the REVERSal Effects of Idarucizumab in Patients on Active Dabigatran (RE-VERSE AD\u2122) is a global phase 3 prospective cohort study aimed at investigating idarucizumab in dabigatran-treated patients who present with uncontrollable or life-threatening bleeding, and in those requiring urgent surgery or intervention. We describe the rationale for, and design of the trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02104947).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b6f","authors":["Schattauer GmbH - Publishers for Medicine and Natural Sciences","C.
