This paper explores some of the hypotheses and challenges of energy medicine including healer interventions, electromagnetic therapies, and homeopathy. Together with new findings from the bioelectromagnetic field, they spell out the rudiments of a new paradigm for biology and medicine based on information. Information embraces the complex network of relations in the matter and energy transactions of living systems. It offers a unified view of energy medicine modalities as well as a fresh perspective for biology and medicine and new questions for further research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51a3cf058f61000387c","authors":["Rubik, "],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-12T22:49:10+00:00","issns":["1078-6791"],"issue":"1","journal":"Alternative Therapies in Health & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1434149291,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9359774"],"pmid":"9359774","pubdate":"1995-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Energy Medicine and the Unifying Concept of Information","type":"article","volume":"1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5222019,"mean":6.1569969054133,"rank":3674494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":875012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5222019,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177561,"mean":8.6453655327778,"rank":125394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177561,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331,"mean":6.0652727272727,"rank":240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.7888888888889,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CamWellness\/status\/609492422003785728","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4142728],"posted_on":"2015-06-12T22:48:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Cam Wellness","url":"http:\/\/www.cam-wellness.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000573443573\/1c19e70e7f2731336a7538d8eca7ad9a_normal.jpeg","description":"For Betterment of Human Life.
