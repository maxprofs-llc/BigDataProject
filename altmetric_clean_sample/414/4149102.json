These immune checkpoints are hijacked by tumors to promote dysfunction of anti-tumor effector cells and consequently of tumor escape from the host immune system. Areas covered: Programmed death-1\/programmed death ligand (PD-1\/PDL-1), a checkpoint pathway, has been extensively investigated in leukemia mouse models. Expression of PD-1 on the surface of activated immune cells and of its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, on leukemic blasts has been documented. Clinical trials with PD-1 inhibitors in patients with hematological malignancies are ongoing with promising clinical responses. Expert opinion: Therapy of hematological cancers with antibodies blocking inhibitory receptors is expected to be highly clinically effective. Checkpoint inhibitory receptors and their ligands are co-expressed on hematopoietic cells found in the leukemic milieu. Several distinct immunological mechanisms are likely to be engaged by antibody-based checkpoint blockade. Co-expression of multiple inhibitory receptors on hematopoietic cells offers an opportunity for combining blocking antibodies to achieve more effective therapy. Up-regulation of receptor\/ligand expression in the leukemic milieu may provide a blood marker predictive of response. Finally, chemotherapy-induced up-regulation of PD-1 on T cells after conventional leukemia therapy creates a solid rationale for application of checkpoint blockade as a follow-up therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073bf","authors":["Sehgal, Alison","Whiteside, Theresa L","Boyiadzis, Michael"],"doi":"10.1517\/14712598.2015.1051028","endpage":"1203","first_seen_on":"2015-06-13T22:37:30+00:00","funders":["niehs","phs","nci"],"issns":["1744-7682","1471-2598"],"issue":"8","journal":"Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1455190174,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26036819","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26036819?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26036819","pubdate":"2015-06-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1191","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Programmed death-1 checkpoint blockade in acute myeloid leukemia.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/programmed-death1-checkpoint-blockade-acute-myeloid-leukemia-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7182236,"mean":6.3148176187464,"rank":2869254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4281755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7182236,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217386,"mean":8.089572307197,"rank":81790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":134037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217386,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":856,"mean":2.2411040935673,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":856,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.6175675675676,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
