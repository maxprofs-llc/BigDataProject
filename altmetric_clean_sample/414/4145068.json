Turbulent historic events and diverse geography of the region have produced a diverse contemporary population whose genetic analysis could provide insight into past demographic events.\nThe aims of this study were to characterize the Slovenian mitochondrial gene pool at the micro-geographic level and to compare it with surrounding populations.\nA total of 402 individuals from five Slovenian regions were analysed in this study by typing HVR I, HVR II and coding region polymorphisms of mtDNA.\nAnalysis revealed 47 haplogroups and sub-haplogroups, the most common of which were H*, H1, J1c, T2 and U5a. Intra-population comparisons revealed a sharp gradient of the J1c haplogroup between Slovenian regions, with a peak frequency of 24.5% being observed in the population of the Littoral Region.\nThe sharp gradient of the J1c haplogroup between Slovenian regions is in line with the archaeological horizon known as Impressed Ware culture and could, therefore, represent a genetic trace of the early Neolithic expansion route along the East Adriatic coastal region.","altmetric_jid":"55c8b9422a83ee4e4d8b4567","authors":["Zupan, Andrej","Hauptman, Nina","Glava\u010d, Damjan"],"doi":"10.3109\/03014460.2015.1006678","first_seen_on":"2015-06-13T10:19:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-5033"],"journal":"Annals of Human Biology","last_mentioned_on":1434190700,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26065896?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26065896","pubdate":"2015-06-13T22:06:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"The maternal perspective for five Slovenian regions: The importance of regional sampling.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maternal-perspective-five-slovenian-regions-importance-regional-sampling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5223626,"mean":6.1581687165544,"rank":4348280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5223626,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178144,"mean":8.6377307444021,"rank":145039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178144,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263,"mean":5.3339770992366,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.193,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
