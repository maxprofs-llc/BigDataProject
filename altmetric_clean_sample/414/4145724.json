Resveratrol exhibits an anticancer effect on various human cancer cells. However, the mechanism of resveratrol-induced anti-cancer effect at the molecular level remains to be elucidated. In this study, the mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effect of resveratrol in human ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR-3 and Caov-3) was investigated using various molecular biology techniques, such as flow cytometry, western blotting, and RNA interference, with a major focus on the potential role of autophagy in resveratrol-induced apoptotic cell death. We demonstrated that resveratrol induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which triggers autophagy and subsequent apoptotic cell death. Resveratrol induced ATG5 expression and promoted LC3 cleavage. The apoptotic cell death induced by resveratrol was attenuated by both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of autophagy. The autophagy inhibitor chloroquine, which functions at the late stage of autophagy, significantly reduced resveratrol-induced cell death and caspase 3 activity in human ovarian cancer cells. We also demonstrated that targeting ATG5 by siRNA also suppressed resveratrol-induced apoptotic cell death. Thus, we concluded that a common pathway between autophagy and apoptosis exists in resveratrol-induced cell death in OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Lang, Fangfang","Qin, Zhaoyang","Li, Fang","Zhang, Huilin","Fang, Zhenghui","Hao, Enkui"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0129196","first_seen_on":"2015-06-13T11:42:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1451573901,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26067645?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0129196","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26067645"],"pmid":"26067645","pubdate":"2015-06-13T22:03:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Apoptotic Cell Death Induced by Resveratrol Is Partially Mediated by the Autophagy Pathway in Human Ovarian Cancer Cells.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apoptotic-cell-death-induced-resveratrol-partially-mediated-autophagy-pathway-human-ovarian-cancer-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6896042,"mean":6.1898417149761,"rank":3380631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2012042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6896042,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216055,"mean":8.0556773121536,"rank":114918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":79711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216055,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101945,"mean":9.9529054186614,"rank":58798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":32304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101945,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6358,"mean":8.8329312568822,"rank":3836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6358,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
