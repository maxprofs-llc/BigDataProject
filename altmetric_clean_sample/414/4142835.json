Reaction of the iodinated intermediate with ethylene glycol and subsequent treatment with base led to formation of the C3-acetyl chlorin. Reaction of the iodinated intermediate with ethylenediamine afforded the C3-oxiranyl chlorin. The C3-formyl chlorin was readily derived from the epoxide without hazardous reagents such as OsO4. These reactions were facile and useful alternatives to the previous methods.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Oba, Toru","Masuya, Takuto","Yasuda, Satoru","Ito, Satoshi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2015.05.024","first_seen_on":"2015-06-12T23:13:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-3405","0960894X"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1434150800,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0960894X15004746"],"pmid":"26048784","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Alternative synthesis of 3-acetyl, 3-epoxy, and 3-formyl chlorins from a 3-vinyl chlorin, methyl pyropheophorbide-a, via iodination ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alternative-synthesis-3acetyl-3epoxy-3formyl-chlorins-3vinyl-chlorin-methyl-pyropheophorbidea-via-io"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5222019,"mean":6.1569969054133,"rank":2767594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1774275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5222019,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177561,"mean":8.6453655327778,"rank":99314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":60703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177561,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1731,"mean":2.5506450867052,"rank":784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1731,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":0.74705882352941,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
