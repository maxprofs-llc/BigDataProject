These biominerals are part of the gravity and linear acceleration detection system of the inner ear. Mutations in otopetrin 1 have been shown to result in lack of otoconia in tilted and mergulhador mutant mice. The molecular function of Otopetrin 1, a novel protein that contains ten predicted transmembrane domains, however, has remained elusive. Here we show that a mutation in the orthologous gene in zebrafish is responsible for the complete absence of otoliths in backstroke mutants. We examined the localization of Starmaker, a secreted protein that is highly abundant in otoliths in backstroke mutants. Starmaker protein accumulated within cells of the otic epithelium, indicating a possible defect in secretion. Our data suggest that Otopetrin 1 in zebrafish may be involved in the protein trafficking of components required for formation of biominerals in the ear.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ea","authors":["S\u00f6llner, Christian","Schwarz, Heinz","Geisler, Robert","Nicolson, Teresa"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00427-004-0440-2","first_seen_on":"2015-06-13T19:26:28+00:00","issns":["0949-944X"],"issue":"12","journal":"Development Genes & Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1330087697,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15480759"],"pmid":"15480759","pubdate":"2004-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"LifeSciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"Mutated otopetrin 1 affects the genesis of otoliths and the localization of Starmaker in zebrafish.","type":"article","volume":"214","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mutated-otopetrin-1-affects-genesis-otoliths-localization-starmaker-zebrafish"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999641,"mean":5.0355594219728,"rank":918774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2531196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999641,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110832,"mean":6.8656062233214,"rank":30850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":77219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110832,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128,"mean":2.6335275590551,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.4375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
