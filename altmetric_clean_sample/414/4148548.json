Concomitant diseases were chronic alcoholism ( n = 3), diabetes mellitus ( n = 1), and reflux esophagitis ( n = 1). Primary diagnosis was made endoscopically in all cases. Endoscopic findings other than pseudodiverticula were esophageal webs ( n = 2) and proximal esophageal stenoses ( n = 4). The typical radiologic findings were detectable in two patients, pathologic manometric findings were seen in only one patient. The authors treated the concomitant diseases and performed endoscopic dilatations of esophageal stenoses. One case with initial bleeding from an associated web is described in detail. According to our knowledge, this is the first publication of a case of EIP-associated bleeding.\nEsophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis is a differential diagnosis in cases of dysphagia and\/or esophageal strictures if no other causes are found. The authors think that endoscopy is the method of choice for establishing the diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be5","authors":["Hahne, M","Schilling, D","Arnold, J C","Riemann, J F"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-13T21:13:07+00:00","issns":["0192-0790"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1333695374,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11606853"],"pmid":"11606853","pubdate":"2001-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis: review of symptoms including upper gastrointestinal bleeding.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/esophageal-intramural-pseudodiverticulosis-review-symptoms-including-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999641,"mean":5.0355594219728,"rank":918747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2531139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999641,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110790,"mean":6.8670084683028,"rank":30836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":77188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110790,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1148,"mean":2.3523557105493,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1148,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.9804347826087,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
