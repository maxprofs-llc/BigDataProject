Sarcocyst walls were thick and possessed villous protrusions measuring 3.5-5.5\u00a0\u03bcm in length. Beauty rat snakes Elaphe taeniura (Cope) fed sarcocysts of the species shed sporulated o\u00f6cysts measuring 13-18\u00a0\u00d7\u00a09-13 (16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012)\u00a0\u03bcm with a prepatent period of 16 to 17 days. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA gene sequences revealed a close relationship between S. clethrionomyelaphis and other colubrid-transmitted species of Sarcocystis Lankester, 1882. This is the first report identifying S. clethrionomyelaphis from its natural intermediate host.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008ab9","authors":["Hu, Jun-Jie","Liu, Ting-Ting","Liu, Qiong","Esch, G W","Chen, Jin-Qing"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11230-015-9572-1","first_seen_on":"2015-06-14T00:42:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-5192"],"issue":"3","journal":"Systematic Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1443862147,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26063304?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26063304","pubdate":"2015-06-14T22:11:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agriculture","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Anatomy \/ Morphology \/ Histology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Systematics\/Taxonomy\/Biogeography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Sarcocystis clethrionomyelaphis Matuschka, 1986 (Apicomplexa: Sarcocystidae) infecting the large oriental vole Eothenomys miletus (Thomas) (Cricetidae: Microtinae) and its phylogenetic relationships with other species of Sarcocystis Lankester, 1882.","type":"article","volume":"91"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6420515,"mean":5.8843321179586,"rank":4742954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":951513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6420515,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186448,"mean":8.671074332116,"rank":131305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":34842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186448,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":2.27673089701,"rank":242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.07,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/phy_papers\/status\/609883212077084672","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4149711],"posted_on":"2015-06-14T00:41:03+00:00","author":{"name":"phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438115152294989824\/0M7ZG0xC_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for phylogenetics papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
