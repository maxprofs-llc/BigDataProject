Health professionals should take these into consideration when managing dermatological problems in elderly patients. Accordingly, current research is investigating the dermatological problems associated with the loss of cutaneous function with age. As cell renewal slows, the physical and chemical barrier function declines, cutaneous permeability increases, and the skin becomes increasingly vulnerable to external factors. In geriatric dermatology, the consequences of cutaneous aging lead to xerosis, skin folding, moisture-associated skin damage, and impaired wound healing. These problems pose significant challenges for both the elderly and their carers. Most often, nurses manage skin care in the elderly. However, until recently, little attention has been paid to developing appropriate, evidence-based, skincare protocols. The objective of this paper is to highlight common clinical problems with aging skin and provide some appropriate advice on cosmetic protocols for managing them. A review of the literature from 2004 to 2014 using PubMed was performed by a working group of six European dermatologists with clinical and research experience in dermatology. Basic topical therapy can restore and protect skin barrier function, which relieves problems associated with xerosis, prevents aggravating moisture-associated skin damage, and enhances quality of life. In conclusion, the authors provide physicians with practical recommendations to assist them in implementing basic skin care for the elderly in an integrated care approach.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f02","authors":["Sophie Seite","Philippe Humbert","Brigitte Dreno","Jean Krutmann","Thomas Luger","Raoul Triller","Sylvie Meaume","Humbert, Philippe","Dr\u00e9no, Brigitte","Krutmann, Jean","Luger, Thomas Anton","Triller, Raoul","Meaume, Sylvie","Seit\u00e9, Sophie"],"doi":"10.2147\/cia.s96232","first_seen_on":"2016-02-15T01:35:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-1998"],"journal":"Clinical Interventions in Aging","last_mentioned_on":1458151041,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/recommendations-for-managing-cutaneous-disorders-associated-with-advan-peer-reviewed-article-CIA","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26929610?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=28988","pmid":"26929610","pubdate":"2016-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Recommendations for managing cutaneous disorders associated with advancing age","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recommendations-managing-cutaneous-disorders-associated-advancing-age"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8194285,"mean":6.9280538712044,"rank":3244473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4923259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8194285,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335619,"mean":9.9906437616571,"rank":112646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":221100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335619,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":986,"mean":5.3235756345178,"rank":351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":986,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":4.2723673469388,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
