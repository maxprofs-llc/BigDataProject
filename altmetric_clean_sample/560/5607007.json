First-order (histogram indices) and higher-order (grey-level run length, difference, size zone matrices) textural features of primary tumours were extracted by PET texture analysis. Conventional PET parameters including metabolic tumour volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and standardized uptake value (SUV) were also measured. To assess and compare the predictive performance of imaging biomarkers, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for censored survival data and areas under the ROC curve (AUC) at 2\u00a0years after diagnosis were used. Associations between imaging biomarkers and overall survival were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models.\nThe best imaging biomarker for overall survival prediction was first-order entropy (AUC\u2009=\u20090.720), followed by TLG (AUC\u2009=\u20090.697), MTV (AUC\u2009=\u20090.692), and maximum SUV (AUC\u2009=\u20090.625). After adjusting for age, sex, clinical stage, tumour size and serum CA19-9 level, multivariable Cox analysis demonstrated that higher entropy (hazard ratio, HR, 5.59; P\u2009=\u20090.028) was independently associated with worse survival, whereas TLG (HR 0.98; P\u2009=\u20090.875) was not an independent prognostic factor.\nIntratumoral heterogeneity of (18)F-FDG uptake measured by PET texture analysis is an independent predictor of survival along with tumour stage and serum CA19-9 level in patients with PDAC. In addition, first-order entropy as a measure of intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity is a better quantitative imaging biomarker of prognosis than conventional PET parameters.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002843","authors":["Hyun, Seung Hyup","Kim, Ho Seong","Choi, Seong Ho","Choi, Dong Wook","Lee, Jong Kyun","Lee, Kwang Hyuck","Park, Joon Oh","Lee, Kyung-Han","Kim, Byung-Tae","Choi, Joon Young"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00259-016-3316-6","first_seen_on":"2016-02-14T17:45:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1619-7089"],"journal":"European Journal of Nuclear Medicine & Molecular Imaging","last_mentioned_on":1455471911,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26872788?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"26872788","pubdate":"2016-02-14T22:00:47+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Intratumoral heterogeneity of 18F-FDG uptake predicts survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intratumoral-heterogeneity-18ffdg-uptake-predicts-survival-patients-pancreatic-ductal-adenocarcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7191979,"mean":6.3236280124852,"rank":5411434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7191979,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321210,"mean":9.6929955574093,"rank":223123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":53883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321210,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":895,"mean":2.0441946308725,"rank":615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":895,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":2.8518181818182,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
