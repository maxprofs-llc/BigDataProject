We defined 2 parameters: (1) VOL, extracted tumor volume with a threshold \u2265 -400 HU; and (2) ATN, the mean CT attenuation value. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was recorded as F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography\/CT parameter. The prognostic values were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier and a Cox proportional hazards analysis.\nOverall survival and progression-free survival were significantly worse in patients with larger VOL, higher ATN, and higher SUVmax. VOL was an independent indicator of overall survival, whereas ATN was an indicator of progression-free survival, lymph node recurrence, and distant metastasis. However, SUVmax was not an independent prognostic factor for either outcome.\nVOL and ATN from 3-dimensional image analysis of CT scans have prognostic values for non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c0f","authors":["Satoh, Yoko","Motosugi, Utaroh","Nambu, Atsushi","Saito, Akitoshi","Onishi,
