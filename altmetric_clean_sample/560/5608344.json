Participants were asked how often they used a range of illicit drugs in the previous 6\u00a0months at annual interviews. Drug-related hospital admissions were defined as hospital admissions for mental or behavioural disorders due to illicit drug use (ICD 10: F11-16, F18, F19), drug poisoning (T40-T45, T50) or toxic effect of gases (T53, T59, T65). Drug-related hospitalisations were 4.8 times higher in the HIV-ve cohort [SIR 4.75 (95\u00a0%\u00a0CI 3.30-6.91)] and 3.5 times higher in the HIV+ve cohort [SIR 3.51 (1.92-5.88)] compared with the general population. Periods of weekly drug use [IRR 1.86 (1.01-3.46)], poly-drug use [IRR 2.17 (1.07-4.38)] and cannabis use [low use-IRR 1.95 (1.01-3.77), high use-IRR 2.58 (1.29-5.16)] were associated with drug-related hospitalisation in both cohorts, as was being a consistently high meth\/amphetamine user throughout follow-up [IRR 3.24 (1.07-9.83)] and being an inconsistent or consistent injecting drug user throughout follow-up [IRR 3.94 (1.61-9.66), IRR 4.43(1.04-18.76), respectively]. Other risk factors for drug-related hospitalisation indicated the likelihood of comorbid drug and mental health issues in GBM hospitalised for drug use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","authors":["Moore, Cecilia L","Gidding, Heather F","Jin, Fengyi","Mao, Limin","Petoumenos, Kathy","Zablotska, Iryna B","Poynten, I Mary","Prestage, Garrett","Law, Matthew G","Grulich, Andrew E","Amin, Janaki","Cecilia L.
