The electronic search yielded 3844 titles, from which 151 studies were ultimately selected. The authors also conducted a manual search that included searching 8 specialty dental journals that published articles on implant-related research during 2001 to 2004. The manual search yielded 25 additional studies. Overall, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were found. Inclusion criteria required studies to have patients clinically examined at follow-up and to have reported on the characteristics of the fixed partial dentures (FPD) structure. The meta-analysis included 13 of 176 studies in which patients with 5 or 10 years of follow-up in a prospective or retrospective study design were evaluated clinically at the end of the follow-up period.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a34","doi":"10.1016\/s1532-3382(12)70041-6","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T16:37:43+00:00","issns":["1532-3382"],"issue":"3 Suppl","journal":"Journal of Evidence-Based Dental Practice","last_mentioned_on":1416492000,"links":["http:\/\/www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca\/pubmed\/23253849"],"pmid":"23253849","pubdate":"2012-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Survival and complication rates of fixed partial dentures supported by a combination of teeth and implants.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survival-complication-rates-fixed-partial-dentures-supported-combination-teeth-implants-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4531279,"mean":5.2895690895932,"rank":787227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3724025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4531279,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139045,"mean":8.1248658985646,"rank":28951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":109697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139045,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":1.9217058823529,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.1166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"When is it appropriate to link a prosthesis to natural teeth and implants?","url":"http:\/\/www.oasisdiscussions.ca\/2014\/11\/20\/pros-2\/","citation_ids":[2375731,2908991,2908992],"posted_on":"2014-11-20T14:00:00+00:00","summary":"This question was submitted by a general dentist: When  [&hellip;]","author":{"name":"Oasis Discussions","url":"http:\/\/www.oasisdiscussions.ca\/","description":""}}]}}
