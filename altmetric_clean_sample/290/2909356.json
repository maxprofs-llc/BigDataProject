How health care practitioners understand and intervene upon drug use among their patients is complicated by these two models. While harm reduction can be understood as a form of governmentality wherein drug-taking individuals express their regulated autonomy through self-governance, the notion of addiction as a disease removes the option of self-governance through negating the will of the individual. Through analysis of qualitative interviews conducted with 13 health care practitioners who provide care for economically marginalized people who use drugs in New York City, it was found that the absence of will articulated in constructions of addiction as disease offered a gateway through which health care practitioners could bring in ideological commitments associated with harm reduction, such as the de-stigmatization of drug use. Despite differences in the attribution of agency, sewing together these two approaches allowed health care practitioners to work with drug-using patients in practical and compassionate ways. This resembles the strategic deployment of diverse subjectivities found in feminist, post-structural liberatory projects wherein differential subjectification proves tactical and productive. Although drug-using patients may enjoy the benefits of practical and compassionate health care, the conjoint facilitation and denouncement of their will occasioned by the use of both harm reduction and the disease model of addiction imply their management by both pastoral and disciplinary technologies of power.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003d16","authors":["Kelly Szott","Szott K"],"doi":"10.1177\/1363459314556904","endpage":"522","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T18:41:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1461-7196","1363-4593"],"issue":"5","journal":"Health (1949-4998)","last_mentioned_on":1443784559,"links":["http:\/\/hea.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2014\/11\/12\/1363459314556904.abstract","http:\/\/hea.sagepub.com\/content\/19\/5\/507.long","http:\/\/hea.sagepub.com\/content\/19\/5\/507.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hea.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2014\/11\/12\/1363459314556904.full.pdf","pmid":"25394654","pubdate":"2014-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"startpage":"507","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Contingencies of the will: Uses of harm reduction and the disease model of addiction among health care practitioners.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contingencies-uses-harm-reduction-disease-model-addiction-among-health-care-practitioners"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6427836,"mean":5.8881348108638,"rank":428834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":5997753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6427836,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183743,"mean":7.9242232478151,"rank":17317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":166360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183743,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1620,"mean":1.8119246448425,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":1563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1620,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":2.8607954545455,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":4},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":4,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"CO":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/claudiovidalg\/status\/535502850978496513","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2909356],"posted_on":"2014-11-20T18:40:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Claudio Vidal","url":"https:\/\/claudiovidal.wordpress.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000805398833\/01a085bed38518efba2dec74d6da7339_normal.jpeg","description":"Mis intereses: las drogas, quienes las toman y la reducci\u00f3n de riesgos y da\u00f1os.
