But its underlying mechanism remains undefined. Herein, we show that a prokaryotic expressed TAT-CT3 induced a rapid elevation of STAT3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3), and then suppress the transcription of miR-155 and induce the elevation of SOCS-1, which further inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation for a long-term period. Our result indicated a novel mechanism of TAT-CT3 to promote HL60 cells differentiation, which provides some potential therapeutic targets for future acute myelogenous leukemia therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fa3cf058f610003009","authors":["Xu S","Xu Z","Liu B","Sun Q","Yang L","Wang J","Wang Y","Liu H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.leukres.2014.07.004","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T04:28:51+00:00","issns":["0145-2126"],"issue":"","journal":"Leukemia Research","last_mentioned_on":1416477607,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25092123?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25092123","pubdate":"2014-08-06T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"LIFR\u03b1-CT3 induces differentiation of a human acute myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60 by suppressing miR-155 expression through the JAK\/STAT Pathway.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lifrct3-induces-differentiation-human-acute-myelogenous-leukemia-cell-line-hl60-suppressing-mir155-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4531279,"mean":5.2895690895932,"rank":3098812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":858358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4531279,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139045,"mean":8.124857268203,"rank":92229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":30619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139045,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":417,"mean":1.5317932692308,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":417,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.0916666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/status\/535111896391639040","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2905194],"posted_on":"2014-11-19T16:46:32+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
