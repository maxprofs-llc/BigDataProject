However, the estimation techniques tend to be unique and applicable only to a certain population. This paper analyzed sex estimation on living individual child below 19 years old using the length of 19 bones of left hand applied for three classification techniques, which were Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) multilayer perceptron. These techniques were carried out on X-ray images of the left hand taken from an Asian population data set. All the 19 bones of the left hand were measured using Free Image software, and all the techniques were performed using MATLAB. The group of age \"16-19\" years old and \"7-9\" years old were the groups that could be used for sex estimation with as their average of accuracy percentage was above 80%. ANN model was the best classification technique with the highest average of accuracy percentage in the two groups of age compared to other classification techniques. The results show that each classification technique has the best accuracy percentage on each different group of age.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002900","doi":"10.1016\/j.forsciint.2014.11.007","first_seen_on":"2014-11-19T08:34:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0379-0738"],"journal":"Forensic Science International","last_mentioned_on":1416362285,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fsijournal.org%2Farticle%2FS0379-0738%252814%252900472-1%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=fsi-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.fsijournal.org\/article\/S0379073814004721\/pdf","pmid":"25540897","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"Comparison on three classification techniques for sex estimation from the bone length of Asian children below 19 years old: an analysis using different group of ages","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-three-classification-techniques-sex-estimation-bone-length-asian-children-below-19-years"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4527185,"mean":5.2867864119486,"rank":3095985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":857312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4527185,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138356,"mean":8.1648648043079,"rank":91773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":30472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138356,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1159,"mean":3.1271295336788,"rank":785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1159,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.1777777777778,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
