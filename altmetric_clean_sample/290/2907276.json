Our aim was to study whether SMF induces oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat tissues and to evaluate the possible protector effect of selenium (Se) and vitamin E (vit E) supplementations. Rats were randomly divided into control, SMF-exposed, Se-treated, vit E-treated, SMF exposed rats and co-treated with Se, and SMF exposed rats and co-treated with vit E. After animal sacrifice, catalase (CAT) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration were measured and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) immunohistochemical labeling was performed in kidney and muscle. Exposure of rats to SMF (128 mT, 1 h\/day for 5 days) increased the MDA concentrations (+25%) and CAT activities (+34%) in kidney but not in muscle. By contrast, the same treatment failed to induce a caspase-independent pathway apoptosis in both tissues. Interestingly, Se pre-treatment inhibited the increase of MDA concentrations and CAT activities in kidney in SMF-exposed rats. However, vit E administration corrected only MDA levels in rat kidney. In conclusion, exposure to SMF induced oxidative stress in kidney that can be prevented by treatment with Se or vit E.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9373cf058f61000decb","authors":["Ghodbane S","Lahbib A","Ammari M","Sakly M","Abdelmelek H"],"doi":"10.4149\/gpb_2014027","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T10:54:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"General physiology and biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1416476406,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25395602"],"pmid":"25395602","pubdate":"2014-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","physiology"],"title":"Does static magnetic field-exposure induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat kidney and muscle?
