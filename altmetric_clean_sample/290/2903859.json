Although the roles of some WOXs in meristematic cell regulation have been well studied in annual plants such as Arabidopsis and rice, the expression and function of WOX members in woody plant poplars has not been systematically investigated. Here, we present the identification and comprehensive analysis of the expression and function of WOXs in Populus tomentosa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Liu B","Wang L","Zhang J","Li J","Zheng H","Chen J","Lu M"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-15-296","first_seen_on":"2014-11-19T22:46:24+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1416396849,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24750781?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24750781","pubdate":"2014-04-23T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"WUSCHEL-related Homeobox genes in Populus tomentosa: diversified expression patterns and a functional similarity in adventitious root formation.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wuschelrelated-homeobox-genes-populus-tomentosa-diversified-expression-patterns-functional-similarit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4527185,"mean":5.2867864119486,"rank":3669953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4527185,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138356,"mean":8.1648684181997,"rank":107884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138356,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4162,"mean":3.6244248978611,"rank":3669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4162,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":346,"mean":3.5894434782609,"rank":317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":346,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
