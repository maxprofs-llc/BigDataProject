Cutaneous infection caused by Alternaria species are relatively rare in humans and most cases reported in the literature are in immunocompromised individuals. We report here on a 33-year old male renal transplant patient with diabetes mellitus who presented with cutaneous alternariosis caused by Alternaria infectoria, two years after the transplant. The diagnosis was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and histopathologic examination. The extension of the lesion under itraconazole treatment required treatment consisting of a combination of surgical excision and liposomal amphotericin B.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f06","authors":["Daglar D","Akman-Karakas A","Ozhak-Baysan B","Gunseren F","Ciftcioglu MA","Buitrago MJ","Rodriguez-Tudela JL"],"first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T14:17:51+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"9","journal":"Clinical Laboratory","last_mentioned_on":1416493049,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25291955?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"25291955","pubdate":"2014-10-09T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Cutaneous Alternaria infectoria infection diagnosed by molecular techniques in a renal transplant patient.","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cutaneous-alternaria-infectoria-infection-diagnosed-molecular-techniques-renal-transplant-patient"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4531279,"mean":5.2895690895932,"rank":3672993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4531279,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139044,"mean":8.1249225347555,"rank":108426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139044,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":1.167037037037,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":0.61555555555556,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Gavalda_J\/status\/535436772118102016","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2908524],"posted_on":"2014-11-20T14:17:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Joan Gavald\u00e0","url":"http:\/\/en.vhir.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/671773375480623105\/lCIdEoGI_normal.jpg","description":"#AntibioticLovers #AntibioticResistance #AMR #Transplant #InfectiousDiseases #SaveAbx #Barcelona #SantPoldeMar #Catalonia","id_on_source":"Gavalda_J","tweeter_id":"49152525","geo":{"lt":41.40237,"ln":2.15641,"country":"ES"},"followers":1468},"tweet_id":"535436772118102016"}]}}
