Both fermentation ecosystems reached equilibrium through a two-phase process, starting with the simultaneous growth of the yeasts (with Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the dominant species) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus plantarum were the dominant species), which were gradually replaced by the acetic acid bacteria (AAB) (Acetobacter tropicalis was the dominant species). In both processes, a sequence of substrate consumption (sucrose, glucose, fructose, and citric acid) and metabolite production kinetics (ethanol, lactic acid, and acetic acid) similar to that of previous, larger-scale fermentation experiments was observed. The technological potential of yeast, LAB, and AAB isolates was evaluated using a polyphasic study that included the measurement of stress-tolerant growth and fermentation kinetic parameters in cocoa pulp media. Overall, strains L. fermentum UFLA CHBE8.12 (citric acid fermenting, lactic acid producing, and tolerant to heat, acid, lactic acid, and ethanol), S. cerevisiae UFLA CHYC7.04 (ethanol producing and tolerant to acid, heat, and ethanol), and Acetobacter tropicalis UFLA CHBE16.01 (ethanol and lactic acid oxidizing, acetic acid producing, and tolerant to acid, heat, acetic acid, and ethanol) were selected to form a cocktail starter culture that should lead to better-controlled and more-reliable cocoa bean fermentation processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Pereira GV","Miguel MG","Ramos CL","Schwan RF"],"doi":"10.1128\/aem.01144-12","first_seen_on":"2014-11-18T21:39:23+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1416344045,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22636007"],"pmid":"22636007","pubdate":"2012-05-29T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Microbiological and Physicochemical Characterization of Small-Scale Cocoa Fermentations and Screening of Yeast and Bacteria Strains for the Development of a Defined Starter Culture.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microbiological-physicochemical-characterization-smallscale-cocoa-fermentations-screening-yeast-bact-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8404855,"mean":7.075818418492,"rank":4488016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2339656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8404855,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232790,"mean":7.5420676836106,"rank":113465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":93191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232790,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5764,"mean":6.7895637688704,"rank":3810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":1216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5764,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":13.557920792079,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
