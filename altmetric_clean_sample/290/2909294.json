We investigated the actions of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) signaling in pancreatic \u03b2-cells of adult mice. atRA signaling was ablated in \u03b2-cells by overexpressing a dominant-negative retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-\u03b1 mutant (RARdn) using an inducible Cre-Lox system under the control of the pancreas duodenal homeobox gene promoter. Our studies establish that hypomorphism for RAR in \u03b2-cells leads to an age-dependent decrease in plasma insulin in the fed state and in response to a glucose challenge. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was also impaired in islets isolated from mice expressing RARdn. Among genes that are atRA responsive, Glut2 and Gck mRNA levels were decreased in isolated islets from RARdn-expressing mice. Histologic analyses of RARdn-expressing pancreata revealed a decrease in \u03b2-cell mass and insulin per \u03b2-cell 1 mo after induction of the RARdn. Our results indicate that atRA signaling mediated by RARs is required in the adult pancreas for maintaining both \u03b2-cell function and mass, and provide insights into molecular mechanisms underlying these actions.-Brun, P.-J., Grijalva, A., Rausch, R., Watson, E., Yuen, J.
