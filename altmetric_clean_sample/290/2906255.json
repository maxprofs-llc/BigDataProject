Based on its favourable biological activities, in the present study, we aimed to investigate whether GSPB2 could inhibit apoptosis in rat mesangial cells treated with glucosamine (GlcN) under high-dose conditions. The results showed that the administration of GSPB2 (10\u00a0\u03bcg\/ml) significantly increased the viability of mesangial cells treated with GlcN at a dose of 15\u00a0mm. We found that GSPB2 inhibited apoptosis in mesangial cells using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphates (dUTP) nick-end labelling staining and flow cytometry technique (P<\u00a00\u00b705 for both). GSPB2 treatment also suppressed oxidative stress by elevating the activity of glutathione peroxidase (P<\u00a00\u00b705) and superoxide dismutase (P<\u00a00\u00b701), as well as prevented cellular damage. GSPB2 enhanced the mRNA expression of nuclear respiratory factor 1, mitochondrial transcription factor A and mitochondrial DNA copy number in mesangial cells as determined by real-time PCR (P<\u00a00\u00b705 for each). Finally, GSPB2 treatment activated the protein expression of PPAR\u03b3 co-activator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in mesangial cells. These findings suggest that GSPB2 markedly ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibits apoptosis in rat mesangial cells treated with high-dose GlcN. This protective effect could be, at least in part, due to the activation of the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1\u03b1 axis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000579a","authors":["Lei Bao","Xiaxia Cai","Zhaofeng Zhang","Yong Li"],"doi":"10.1017\/s000711451400347x","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T09:05:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-2662"],"journal":"British Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1416442170,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25404010"],"pmid":"25404010","pubdate":"2014-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Grape seed procyanidin B2 ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibits apoptosis via the AMP-activated protein kinase-silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1-PPAR\u03b3 co-activator-1\u03b1 axis in rat mesangial cells under high-dose glucosamine.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/grape-seed-procyanidin-b2-ameliorates-mitochondrial-dysfunction-inhibits-apoptosis-via-ampactivated"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4527185,"mean":5.2867864119486,"rank":3669958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4527185,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138942,"mean":8.1170884044308,"rank":108334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138942,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2398,"mean":6.4804939507718,"rank":2035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2398,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":6.2575,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
