Although chemokines were initially appreciated as important mediators of acute inflammation, we now know that this complex system of approximately 50 endogenous chemokine ligands and 20 G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane signaling receptors is also critical for the generation of primary and secondary adaptive cellular and humoral immune responses. Recent studies demonstrate important roles for the chemokine system in the priming of naive T cells, in cell fate decisions such as effector and memory cell differentiation, and in regulatory T cell function. In this review, we focus on recent advances in understanding how the chemokine system orchestrates immune cell migration and positioning at the organismic level in homeostasis, in acute inflammation, and during the generation and regulation of adoptive primary and secondary immune responses in the lymphoid system and peripheral nonlymphoid tissue.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000229c","authors":["Griffith JW","Sokol CL","Luster AD"],"doi":"10.1146\/annurev-immunol-032713-120145","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T06:51:17+00:00","issns":["0732-0582"],"issue":"","journal":"Annual Review of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1416460833,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24655300?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24655300","pubdate":"2014-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Chemokines and chemokine receptors: positioning cells for host defense and immunity.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemokines-chemokine-receptors-positioning-cells-host-defense-immunity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4531279,"mean":5.2895690895932,"rank":3672993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4531279,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139045,"mean":8.1249169615375,"rank":108428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139045,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261,"mean":2.7607692307692,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.1333333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Researcher":80,"Student  > Doctoral Student":28,"Student  > Ph.
