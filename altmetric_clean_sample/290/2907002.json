Any bone of the body can be affected, although there is a predilection for the pelvis, humerus, axial skeleton and the mandible. The mandible is the most commonly involved bone in the maxillofacial region. 41 cases have been reported so far in the literature showing involvement of the mandible in Gorham's disease. This paper presents a rare case of Gorham's disease involving the mandible in a 38-year-old male with a 10-year follow-up.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f35","authors":["SJ Reddy","DS Jatti"],"doi":"10.1259\/dmfr\/93696387","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T10:41:29+00:00","issns":["0250-832X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Dentomaxillofacial Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1416468042,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3520399\/"],"pmid":"22241873","pubdate":"2012-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Institute of Radiology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"520","subjects":["radiology","dentistry"],"title":"Gorham's disease: a report of a case with mandibular involvement in a 10-year follow-up study","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gorhams-disease-report-case-mandibular-involvement-10year-followup-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4531279,"mean":5.2895690895932,"rank":2325515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1608950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4531279,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139045,"mean":8.1249151635455,"rank":69335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":53014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139045,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317,"mean":1.1267405063291,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.63333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
