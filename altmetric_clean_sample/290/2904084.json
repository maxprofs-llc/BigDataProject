The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and possible risk factors for malaria in pregnant women attending antenatal clinic at two primary health facilities in Bobo-Dioulasso.MethodsWe conducted a cross sectional study from September to December 2010 in two primary health facilities located in the periurban area of Bobo-Dioulasso. Pregnant women attending antenatal clinic (ANC) were included in the study after signing informed consent. For each participant, the social-demographic profile, malaria and obstetric histories were investigated through a questionnaire. Peripheral blood was collected and thick and thin blood smears were prepared to check Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia. Hemoglobin concentration was measured. The associations between age, parity, gestational age, schooling, number of ANC visits, use of IPTp-SP, use of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and anemia with the occurrence of P. falciparum malaria infection during pregnancy were analyzed through logistic regression.ResultsDuring the period of study, 105 (18.1%) out of 579 pregnant women were infected by P. falciparum. The hemoglobin concentration mean was 10.5\u00bf\u00b1\u00bf1.7\/dL and was significantly lower in pregnant women with malaria infection (9.8\u00a0g\/dL \u00b11.6) than in those who had no malaria infection (10.6\u00a0g\/dL \u00b11.7) (P\u00bf<\u00bf0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that, education (AOR 1.9, 95% CI\u00bf=\u00bf[1.2-3.2]), parity [primigravidae (AOR 5.0, 95% CI\u00bf=\u00bf[2.5-9.8]) and secundigravidae (AOR 2.1, 95% CI\u00bf=\u00bf[1.2-3.8])], and anaemia (AOR 2.1, 95% CI\u00bf=\u00bf[1.3-3.5]) were significantly associated with P. falciparum malaria infection. The use of IPTp-SP was not associated with P. falciparum malaria infection.Conclusions P. falciparum malaria infection is common in pregnant women attending antenatal clinic and anaemia is an important complication. The results show that the use of IPTp-SP does not reduce the risk of malaria incidence during pregnancy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","doi":"10.1186\/s12879-014-0631-z","first_seen_on":"2014-11-19T23:35:09+00:00","issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1440232023,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2334\/14\/631\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25408152?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12879-014-0631-z.pdf","pmid":"25408152","pubdate":"2014-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"631","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Prevalence and risk factors for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnant women attending antenatal clinic in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso).","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-risk-factors-plasmodium-falciparum-malaria-pregnant-women-attending-antenatal-clinic-bobo-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5571058,"mean":6.3323036317895,"rank":3707879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1633078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5571058,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180359,"mean":7.9274969449651,"rank":111242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":60909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180359,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2906,"mean":3.2516151462995,"rank":1908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2906,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":3.2679677419355,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
