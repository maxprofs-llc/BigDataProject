This leads to induction of interferon secondary genes (ISGs) in medullary thymocytes, raising the question whether IFN-\u03b1 may play a role in T-cell development. When characterizing further differences between peripheral and thymic pDCs, we found that thymic pDCs have a phenotype consistent with an \"activated signature\" including expression of TNF-\u03b1 and BST2, but no expression of ILT7. Given that BST2 is induced by IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b1 secretion is controlled by interaction between ILT7 and BST2, this regulatory pathway is apparently lost in thymic pDCs. Further, we also show that BST2 is constitutively expressed on a subset of medullary thymocytes at the mRNA and protein level reflecting a history of IFN-\u03b1 transduced signals. The majority of BST2(+) thymocytes express CCR5 rendering them prevalent targets for R5-tropic HIV infection. Moreover, BST2(+) thymocytes express Foxp3 and CD25, consistent with the phenotype of natural Treg cells, and exert suppressive activity as they impair the proliferation of autologous CD3(+) thymocytes. Collectively, our results suggest that low levels of IFN-\u03b1 secreted by thymic pDCs play an important role in the development of natural Treg cells. This article is protected by copyright.
