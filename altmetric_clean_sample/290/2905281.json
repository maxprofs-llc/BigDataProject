Placentation and vascular remodeling are multistep processes, and hypoxia, placental oxidative stress, excessive or atypical maternal immune response to trophoblasts, exaggerated inflammation, and increased production of anti-angiogenic factors such as the soluble form of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sENG) may play a role in poor placentation in preeclampsia. Recent findings suggest that autophagy plays an important role in extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion and vascular remodeling under hypoxia, and sENG inhibits EVT invasion and vascular remodeling by the inhibition of autophagy under hypoxic conditions. In this review, we discuss the relationship between inadequate autophagy and poor placentation in preeclampsia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f03","authors":["Saito S","Nakashima A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jri.2013.06.002","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T05:04:06+00:00","issns":["0165-0378"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Reproductive Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1416417404,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23969229"],"pmid":"23969229","pubdate":"2013-08-24T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"A review of the mechanism for poor placentation in early-onset preeclampsia: the role of autophagy in trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-mechanism-poor-placentation-earlyonset-preeclampsia-role-autophagy-trophoblast-invasion-vascu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4527185,"mean":5.2867864119486,"rank":3669958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4527185,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138943,"mean":8.1170281844224,"rank":108334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138943,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240,"mean":2.9127782426778,"rank":168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":5.4248,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
