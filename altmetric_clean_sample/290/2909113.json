A very large number of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated to diseases whereas others have no known phenotype. For example, among the SNPs mapped within ccn1(cyr61), ccn2(ctgf), ccn3(nov), ccn4(wisp-1), ccn5(wisp-2) and ccn6 (wisp-3), only mutations within ccn4 were associated to PPD (the autosomal recessive skeletal disorder Progressive Pseudorheumatoid Dysplasia). On the occasion of this JCCS special issue on the roles of hormetic responses in adaptation, and response of living species to the modifications of their environment, it appeared that it was a good time to briefly review a topic that has been the subject of passionate discussions for the past few years, that is Direct to Consumer genetic tests (DTC GT). Based on the use of DNA analysis and identification of polymorphisms, DTC GT have been developed by several companies in the USA and in countries where there was no legal obstacle for customers to have direct access to their genetic information and manage their healthcare. Problems that arose and decisions that have been taken by regulatory agencies are presented and discussed in this editorial. The \u00ab freeze \u00bb of health-oriented DTC GT in the USA neither implies the end of DNA analysis nor \u00ab fun \u00bb applications, which are not aimed at providing risks estimates for particular illnesses. As shown in the example which is discussed in this editorial, DTC GT for cosmetic applications might be considered a fun application of great interest for companies such as L'Or\u00e9al, who recently developed the Makeup Genius mobile application. Other fun applications of DTC GT are discussed but there is no doubt that nothing will stop progress and it is most probable than within a few years from now all the tensions raised about these procedures will vanish to the profit and benefit of consumers. In any case, this will only be possible through an intensive communication effort, because \u2026communication is the key !","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bc2","authors":["Bernard Perbal"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12079-014-0258-2","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T17:11:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-9601","1873-961X"],"journal":"Journal of Cell Communication and Signaling","last_mentioned_on":1422274809,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25408105?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12079-014-0258-2"],"pmid":"25408105","pubdate":"2014-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Communication is the key.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/communication-key-part-2-direct-consumer-genetics-future-daily-life"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4657843,"mean":5.6528782728159,"rank":2311367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2206698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4657843,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146442,"mean":8.16521455057,"rank":66447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":73379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146442,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.6364,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":6.077,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
