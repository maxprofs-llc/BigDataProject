The responses of metabolite concentrations, enzyme activities and mRNA levels to various signals and environmental conditions have been well described for the pathway. However, only little is known about the molecular mechanisms of this regulation. To date, nine transcription factors have been described to control transcription of genes of sulfate uptake and assimilation. In addition, other levels of regulation contribute to the control of sulfur metabolism. Post-transcriptional regulation has been shown for sulfate transporters, adenosine 5'phosphosulfate reductase, and cysteine synthase. Several genes of the pathway are targets of microRNA miR395. In addition, protein-protein interaction is increasingly found in the center of various regulatory circuits. On top of the mechanisms of regulation of single genes, we are starting to learn more about mechanisms of adaptation, due to analyses of natural variation. In this article, the summary of different mechanisms of regulation will be accompanied by identification of the major gaps in knowledge and proposition of possible ways of filling them.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b456f","authors":["Anna Koprivova","Stanislav Kopriva"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpls.2014.00589","first_seen_on":"2014-11-19T05:56:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-462X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Plant Science","last_mentioned_on":1416359404,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25400653?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25400653","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Molecular mechanisms of regulation of sulfate assimilation: first steps on a long road.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-mechanisms-regulation-sulfate-assimilation-first-steps-long-road"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4527185,"mean":5.2867864119486,"rank":3669954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4527185,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138355,"mean":8.1649129768566,"rank":107883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138355,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2028,"mean":1.9607094227923,"rank":1255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2028,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165,"mean":2.5684268292683,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
