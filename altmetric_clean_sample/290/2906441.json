The incidence has dramatically increased in the last 20 years. The major contributing factor to this is believed to be the increase in the rate of cesarean delivery. Despite the increased incidence of placenta accreta, most obstetricians have personally managed only a small number of women with placenta accreta. The condition poses dramatic risk for massive hemorrhage and associated complication such as consumption coagulopathy, multisystem organ failure, and death. In addition, there is an increased risk for surgical complications such as injury to bladder, ureters, and bowel and the need for reoperation. Most women require blood transfusion, often in large quantities, and many require admission to an intensive care unit. As a result of indicated, often emergent preterm delivery, many babies require admission to a neonatal care intensive care unit. Outcomes are improved when delivery is accomplished in centers with multidisciplinary expertise and experience in the care of placenta accreta. Such expertise may include maternal-fetal medicine, gynecologic surgery, gynecologic oncology, vascular, trauma and urologic surgery, transfusion medicine, intensivists, neonatologists, interventional radiologists, anesthesiologists, specialized nursing staff, and ancillary personnel. This article highlights the desired features for a center of excellence in placenta accreta, and which patients should be referred for evaluation and\/or delivery in such centers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000570e","authors":["Silver RM","Fox KA","Barton JR","Abuhamad AZ","Simhan H","Huls CK","Belfort MA","Wright JD"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajog.2014.11.018","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T10:05:24+00:00","issns":["0002-9378"],"journal":"American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1444803590,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajog.org%2Farticle%2FS0002-9378%252814%252902248-0%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=ymob-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajog.org%2Farticle%2FS0002-9378%252814%252902248-0%2Ffulltext&code=ymob-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajog.org%2Farticle%2FS0002-9378%252814%252902248-0%2Ffulltext&code=ymob-site","http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/S0002-9378(14)02248-0\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/S0002-9378%2814%2902248-0\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/S0002-9378(14)02248-0\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/S0002937814022480\/pdf","pmid":"25460838","pubdate":"2015-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Center of excellence for placenta accreta","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/center-excellence-placenta-accreta-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6241002,"mean":5.9827689250512,"rank":436068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":5804099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6241002,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180226,"mean":7.8497611763075,"rank":17162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":163026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180226,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3856,"mean":6.993362386511,"rank":411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3856,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169,"mean":6.6887380952381,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":1,"practitioner":5,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
