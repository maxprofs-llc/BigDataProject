Using 1H NMR spectroscopy, we have compared the metabolite profiles of red blood cells infected with different P. falciparum strains. These included both chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains, as well as transfectant lines engineered to express different alleles of the chloroquine-resistance-conferring P. falciparum Chloroquine Resistance Transporter(pfcrt). Our analyses revealed strain-specific differences in a range of metabolites. There was marked variation in the levels of the membrane precursors choline and phosphocholine, with some strains having >30-fold higher choline levels and >5-fold higher phosphocholine levels than others. Chloroquine-resistant strains showed elevated levels of a number of amino acids relative to chloroquine-sensitive strains, including an approximately 2-fold increase in aspartate levels. The elevation in amino acid levels was attributable to mutations in pfcrt. Pfcrt-linked differences in amino acid abundance were confirmed using alternate extraction and detection (HPLC) methods. Mutations acquired to withstand chloroquine exposure therefore give rise to significant biochemical alterations in the parasite.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f6","authors":["Rongwei Teng","Adele M Lehane","Markus Winterberg","Sarah H Shafik","Robert L Summers","Rowena E Martin","Donelly A van Schalkwyk","Pauline R Junankar","Kiaran Kirk"],"doi":"10.1042\/bsr20140134","first_seen_on":"2014-11-19T22:46:21+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["1573-4935"],"journal":"Bioscience Reports","last_mentioned_on":1416396842,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25405893?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25405893","pubdate":"2014-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"1H-NMR metabolite profiles of different strains of Plasmodium falciparum.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sup1sup-hnmr-metabolite-profiles-different-strains-iplasmodium-falciparumi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4527185,"mean":5.2867864119486,"rank":3669954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4527185,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138355,"mean":8.1649129768566,"rank":107883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138355,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293,"mean":1.4748904109589,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.55,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
