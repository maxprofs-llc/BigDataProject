Besides positive BOLD changes, negative BOLD changes have sometimes been observed in the default-mode network, particularly using group analysis. A new fast fMRI sequence called MREG (Magnetic Resonance Encephalography) shows increased sensitivity to detect IED-related BOLD changes compared to the conventional EPI sequence, including frequent occurrence of negative BOLD responses in the DMN. The present study quantifies the concordance between the DMN and negative BOLD related to IEDs of temporal and extra-temporal origin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074aa","authors":["Jacobs, Julia","Menzel, Antonia","Ramantani, Georgia","K\u00f6rbl, Katharina","Assl\u00e4nder, Jakob","Schulze-Bonhage, Andreas","Hennig, J\u00fcrgen","LeVan, Pierre"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnins.2014.00335","first_seen_on":"2014-11-18T17:50:15+00:00","issns":["1662-4548","1662-453X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1416391567,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fnins.2014.00335\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fnins.2014.00335\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4235409","pmid":"25477775","pubdate":"2014-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Negative BOLD in default-mode structures measured with EEG-MREG is larger in temporal than extra-temporal epileptic spikes","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/negative-bold-defaultmode-structures-measured-eegmreg-larger-temporal-extratemporal-epileptic-spikes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6393346,"mean":5.8560625991571,"rank":2229014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4128683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6393346,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182631,"mean":7.9057478179929,"rank":59440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":121797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182631,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1848,"mean":6.9125749864645,"rank":870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1848,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":6.4266271186441,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
