Their effects on HIV progression is still in debate. This study aimed to assess the association between alcohol and drug use and an HIV disease progression biomarker (CD4 cell count) among patients on ART. A cross-sectional study was carried out at an HIV treatment center affiliated with Medical School of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Four hundred and thirty-eight HIV-positive patients on ART were interviewed by trained psychiatrists and psychologists using the following instruments: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ). In the previous month, 219 (50%) and 41 (9.3%) patients reported use of alcohol and illicit drugs, respectively. Fifty patients (12.6%) were classified as having harmful alcohol use by AUDIT. According to SCID-I, 80 patients (18.3%) were alcohol abusers, 24 (5.5%) alcohol dependents, and 21 (4.2%) had a current depressive disorder. Almost 73% (n = 319-72.8%) of the patients were adherent to ART. Alcohol dependents were nine times (p < 0.01) more likely to have CD4 cell count \u2264200\/mm(3), and this association was independent of ART adherence. In conclusion, alcohol dependence seems to be associated with low CD4 cell count in HIV-positive patients. Based on these data, HIV health care workers should always assess alcohol consumption in the treatment setting, and patients should be advised that alcohol dependence may be linked to low CD4.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000156b","authors":["Malbergier"],"doi":"10.1080\/09540121.2014.947235","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T00:08:58+00:00","issns":["0954-0121"],"journal":"AIDS Care","last_mentioned_on":1416402006,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/routledg\/caic\/2015\/00000027\/00000001\/art00010"],"pmid":"25179410","pubdate":"2014-09-03T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Alcohol dependence and CD4 cell count: is there a relationship?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alcohol-dependence-cd4-cell-count-relationship"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4527185,"mean":5.2867864119486,"rank":3095984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":857310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4527185,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138943,"mean":8.1169605302933,"rank":92123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":30610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138943,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":794,"mean":2.5045825977301,"rank":601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":794,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.5825,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
