A few conclusions of general character could be drawn: While the geometrical change of the chromophore induced by the environment was found to notably alter (diminish) the two-photon absorption cross section in the polar medium, the effects of the metal surface and solvent on the electronic structure of the chromophore surpasses the geometrical effects and leads to a considerably enhanced two-photon absorption cross section in the polar solvent. This enhancement of two-photon absorption arises essentially from the metal charge image induced enlargement of the difference between the dipole moment of the excited state and the ground state. The orientation-dependence of the two-photon absorption is found to connect with the lateral rotation of the chromophore, where the two-photon absorption reaches its maximum when the polarization of the incident light coincides with the long-axis of the chromophore. Our results demonstrate a distinct enhancement of the two-photon absorption by a metal surface and a polar medium and envisage the employment of metal-chromophore composite materials for future development of nonlinear optical materials with desirable properties.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["Xin Li","Zilvinas Rinkevicius","Hans \u00c5gren"],"doi":"10.1021\/ct500579n","first_seen_on":"2014-11-20T05:40:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-9618","1549-9626"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","last_mentioned_on":1416420303,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ct500579n"],"pmid":"26583246","pubdate":"2014-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"startpage":"141119071015008","title":"Two-Photon Absorption of Metal-Assisted Chromophores","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/twophoton-absorption-metalassisted-chromophores"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4527185,"mean":5.2867864119486,"rank":3669958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4527185,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138942,"mean":8.1170812071312,"rank":108334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138942,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2264,"mean":1.1812019443217,"rank":1176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2264,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":1.69365,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
