His medical history included schizophrenia diagnosis, for which he had been being treated since he was 27\u2009years old. EEG disclosed non-convulsive status epilepticus. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) acquired 3\u2009days later showed increased left hippocampal volume with hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences. After being treated with antibiotics and antiepileptic medications, the patient's condition improved. A follow-up MRI showed reduction of the left hippocampus. The relationship between epilepsy and schizophrenia is not yet clear. This case illustrates this interaction. Hippocampal atrophy may have been caused by environmental aggression in the present patient with schizophrenia, perhaps in association with a predisposing genotype.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc9c","authors":["Fujisao, Elaine Keiko","Cristaldo, Nathalia Raquel","Braga, Aline Marques da Silva","Cunha, Paulina Rodrigues","Yamashita, Seizo","Betting, Luiz Eduardo","Elaine Keiko Fujisao","Nathalia Raquel Cristaldo","Aline Marques da Silva Braga","Paulina Rodrigues Cunha","Seizo Yamashita","Luiz Eduardo Betting"],"doi":"10.3389\/fneur.2017.00024","first_seen_on":"2017-02-06T19:00:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-2295"],"journal":"Frontiers in Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1488444873,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fneur.2017.00024\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FNEUR_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5292431\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fneur.2017.00024\/pdf","pmid":"28220103","pubdate":"2017-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Hippocampal damage and atrophy secondary to status epilepticus in a patient with schizophrenia","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fneur.2017.00024\/full","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hippocampal-damage-atrophy-secondary-status-epilepticus-patient-schizophrenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":6294834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1122382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272402,"mean":12.667195487534,"rank":196104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":47217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272402,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1532,"mean":6.0886231221424,"rank":1002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1532,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":3.2930434782609,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
