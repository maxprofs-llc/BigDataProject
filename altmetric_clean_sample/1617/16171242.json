However, the true disinfection efficacy of formalin for tissue infected with M tuberculosis is unclear. We reviewed all pertinent literature from 1900 until the present regarding the disinfection efficacy of formalin for tissue infected with M tuberculosis. We also retrospectively cultured five cases of M tuberculosis from formalin-fixed archival pulmonary tissue. All cultures from our archived tissue were negative. The literature review revealed limited and contradictory information concerning the viability of M tuberculosis in formalin-fixed human tissue. There are no studies which specifically address the viability of M tuberculosis in tissue exclusively fixed in 10% buffered formalin. The disinfection efficacy of formalin for tuberculosis infected tissue remains unclear. Larger, prospective studies using current methodologies are needed to establish guidelines to ensure the safety for those handling infected, fixed tissue.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007680","authors":["Timothy J Kappel","John J Reinartz","Janet L Schmid","John J Holter","Miguel M Azar"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0046-8177(96)90351-2","first_seen_on":"2017-02-06T13:04:26+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["00468177","0046-8177"],"issue":"12","journal":"Human Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1325376000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0046-8177(96)90351-2"],"pmid":"8958312","pubdate":"1996-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"The viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in formalin-fixed pulmonary autopsy tissue: Review of the literature and brief report","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0046817796903512","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/viability-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-formalinfixed-pulmonary-autopsy-tissue-review-literature-brief"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7121011,"mean":6.3005112423631,"rank":1679044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4574947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7121011,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93820,"mean":11.029207090248,"rank":28874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":63357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93820,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1125,"mean":2.9342046263345,"rank":189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1125,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":6.43,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Guidelines for safe work practices in human and animal medical diagnostic laboratories; recommendations of a CDC-convened, biosafety blue ribbon panel","url":"https:\/\/stacks.cdc.gov\/view\/cdc\/11647\/cdc_11647_DS1.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[247663,6332525,919065,16171192,16171193,16171194,16171196,5757516,1677915,16171197,9018262,16171198,16171199,4101968,16171200,16171202,16171204,16171205,16934731,16171206,16171207,3243702,1216195,16171209,16934732,16171210,16171212,3562195,1303330,16171213,3315902,16171214,16171215,16171216,16171217,14567985,14741020,16171218,16171219,16171220,16171221,16171224,16171225,16171227,16171228,16171230,108816,3234900,16171232,16171233,16171234,16171235,14991662,16171236,2547454,16171237,16171238,16171239,16171240,16171242,15016212,16171245,15844818,16171246,16171247,16171248,16171249,16155113,16155120,16171251,16171253,16171255,6661138,14468254,16171257,14470045,16171259,736733,16171262,14727540,16171274,15007733],"posted_on":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","description":"CDC is America\u2019s leading public health agency, dedicated to saving and protecting the health of Americans.
