Utilizing an inexpensive organic photoredox catalyst, alkyl radicals are readily generated from the single-electron oxidation of ammonium alkyl bis(catecholato)silicates and are subsequently engaged in a C-C bond-forming reaction with imines. The process is highly selective, metal-free, and does not require a large excess of the alkylating reagent or the use of acidic additives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006810","authors":["Niki R.
