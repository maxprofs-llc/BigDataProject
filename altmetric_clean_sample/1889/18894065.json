We derived an answer from a historical context and provided an alternative solution by proposing a new compact descriptor. Although existing descriptors can express complicated shapes and depth sensors have been improved, complex shapes are rarely observed in an ordinary environment and a depth sensor only captures a single side of a surface with noise. Therefore, we designed a new descriptor based on principal curvatures, which is compact but practically useful. For verification, the CoRBS dataset, the RGB-D Scenes dataset and the RGB-D Object dataset were used to compare the proposed descriptor with existing descriptors in terms of shape, instance, and category recognition rate. The proposed descriptor showed a comparable performance with existing descriptors despite its low dimensionality of 4.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Hyukdoo Choi","Euntai Kim"],"doi":"10.3390\/s17040876","first_seen_on":"2017-04-16T10:44:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"4","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1492412652,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/4\/876?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/4\/876"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/4\/876\/pdf","pmid":"28420155","pubdate":"2017-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"New Compact 3-Dimensional Shape Descriptor for a Depth Camera in Indoor Environments","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-compact-3dimensional-shape-descriptor-depth-camera-indoor-environments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078137,"mean":6.8589454589436,"rank":5848272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1943235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078137,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214206,"mean":13.240229527789,"rank":139427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":61905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214206,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3319,"mean":1.8909397227245,"rank":1473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3319,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":641,"mean":1.2644875,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":641,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
