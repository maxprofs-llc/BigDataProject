The process involves palladium catalyzed aminocarbonylation of an aryl halide, using a carbodiimide and formic acid as the carbonyl source. Observations made in this effort suggest that the mechanistic pathway for this process involves in-situ generation of carbon monoxide by reaction of formic acid with carbodiimide in the presence of the palladium catalyst. The method can be utilized to produce a variety of amides and N-substituted phthalimides efficiently.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Seo, Yong\u2010Sik","Kim, Dong\u2010Su","Jun, Chul\u2010Ho"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201601421","endpage":"3512","first_seen_on":"2016-11-25T12:33:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1861-471X","18614728"],"issue":"24","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1486000620,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201601421\/abstract;jsessionid=A6E0392B3008A6D488B6378761F70926.f01t01?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+26th+November+2016+from+07%3A00-11%3A00+GMT+%2F+02%3A00-06%3A00+EST+%2F+15%3A00-19%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201601421","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201601421?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201601421\/pdf","pmid":"27813274","pubdate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"3508","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of Amides and Phthalimides via a Palladium Catalyzed Aminocarbonylation of Aryl Halides with Formic Acid and Carbodiimides","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/asia.201601421","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-amides-phthalimides-via-palladium-catalyzed-aminocarbonylation-aryl-halides-formic-acid-ca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":9.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":876478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7261787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268001,"mean":12.098079022388,"rank":43412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":223929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268001,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2490,"mean":1.3721799919646,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":2380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2490,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":1.7691176470588,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemAsianJ\/statuses\/802128049106022400","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14047299],"posted_on":"2016-11-25T12:33:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Chem.
