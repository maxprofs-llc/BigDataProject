The philosophical discussion of psychopathy has focussed upon the psychological faculties that are prerequisites for moral responsibility and empirical findings regarding psychopathy that are relevant to philosophical accounts of moral understanding and motivation. However, there are legitimate worries about whether psychopathy is a robust scientific construct, and there are risks attached to reifying psychopathy or other psychiatric constructs. We defend the concept of psychopathy by pointing out the relevance of empirical studies about it for our ordinary practices of ascribing moral responsibility and folk psychological accounts of moral understanding and motivation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b4a","authors":["Luca Malatesti","John McMillan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11017-014-9277-5","first_seen_on":"2014-02-10T22:00:16+00:00","issns":["1573-1200"],"journal":"Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics","last_mentioned_on":1419333723,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11017-014-9277-5","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24415139?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11017-014-9277-5.pdf","pmid":"24415139","pubdate":"2014-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ethics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"General Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"History of Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy of Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Theory of Medicine\/Bioethics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"title":"Defending psychopathy: an argument from values and moral responsibility.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/defending-psychopathy-argument-values-moral-responsibility"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7952821,"mean":6.7176909171778,"rank":4172956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2220338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7952821,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197633,"mean":7.2981611479924,"rank":94615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":79060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197633,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":3.8484025157233,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.95,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
