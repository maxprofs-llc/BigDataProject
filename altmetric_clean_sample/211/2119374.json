Assemblages of plants pollinated by the same pollinator (pollinator guilds) should exhibit convergence of floral traits because they are exposed to similar selective pressures. Both convergence and the formation of pollination ecotypes should lead to matching of traits among plants and their pollinators.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002271","authors":["Ethan Newman","John Manning","Bruce Anderson","Newman E","Manning J","Anderson B","E.
