Our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of Lamiidae has improved significantly in recent years, however, relationships among the orders and unplaced families of the clade remain partly unresolved. Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis of the Lamiidae based on an expanded sampling, including all families together, for the first time, in a single phylogenetic analyses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ee","authors":["Nancy F.
