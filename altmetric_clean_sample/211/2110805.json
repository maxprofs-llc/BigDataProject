Previous Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies reported white matter microstructure alterations of regions related to the reward system. The present study aimed at extending these findings by specifically investigating connection pathways of the reward system in schizophrenia. Therefore, 24 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls matched for age and gender underwent DTI-scans. Using a probabilistic fiber tracking approach we bilaterally extracted pathways connecting the ventral tegmental area (VTA) with the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortices (mOFC, lOFC), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the amygdala; as well as pathways connecting NAcc with mOFC, lOFC, dlPFC and amygdala resulting in a total of 18 connections. Probability indices forming part of a bundle of interest (PIBI) were compared between groups using independent t-tests. In 6 connection pathways PIBI-values were increased in schizophrenia. In 3 of these pathways the spatial extension of connection pathways was decreased. In schizophrenia patients, there was a negative correlation of PIBI-values and PANSS negative scores in the left VTA-amygdala and in the left NAcc-mOFC connection. A sum score of delusions and hallucinations correlated positively with PIBI-values of the left amygdala-NAcc connection. Structural organization of specific segments of white matter pathways of the reward system in schizophrenia may contribute to the emergence of delusions and negative symptoms in schizophrenia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034cc","authors":["Bracht T","Horn H","Strik W","Federspiel A","Razavi N","Stegmayer K","Wiest R","Dierks T","M\u00fcller TJ","Walther S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.schres.2014.01.015","first_seen_on":"2014-02-10T19:15:02+00:00","issns":["09209964"],"journal":"Schizophrenia Research","last_mentioned_on":1429786384,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0920996414000188","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24485586?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24485586","pubdate":"2014-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"White matter pathway organization of the reward system is related to positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/white-matter-pathway-organization-reward-system-related-positive-negative-symptoms-schizophrenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5030595,"mean":5.9580219135188,"rank":2496090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2381867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5030595,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141520,"mean":8.0050302220904,"rank":64469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":71942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141520,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1965,"mean":4.026932790224,"rank":1093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1965,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":3.31246875,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
