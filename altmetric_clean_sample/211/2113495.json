This in vitro technique for the analysis of quantitative parameters is useful for assessment of semen quality. In fact, thanks to the capabilities of digital holography, the developed algorithm allows us to resolve in-focus amplitude and phase maps of the cells under study, independently of focal plane of the sample image. We have characterized cell motility on clinical samples of seminal fluid. In particular, anomalous sperm cells were characterized and the quantitative motility parameters were compared to those of normal sperm.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c7b","authors":["Giuseppe Di Caprio"],"doi":"10.1364\/boe.5.000690","first_seen_on":"2014-02-11T18:26:56+00:00","issns":["2156-7085"],"journal":"Biomedical Optics Express","last_mentioned_on":1396880163,"links":["http:\/\/www.opticsinfobase.org\/boe\/abstract.cfm?uri=boe-5-3-690","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1364\/BOE.5.000690","http:\/\/www.opticsinfobase.org\/boe\/abstract.cfm?URI=boe-5-3-690","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24688806"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.opticsinfobase.org\/viewmedia.cfm?uri=boe-5-3-690\r\n\t\t@import url(","pmid":"24688806","title":"4D tracking of clinical seminal samples for quantitative characterization of motility parameters","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/4d-tracking-clinical-seminal-samples-quantitative-characterization-motility-parameters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":60.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":60.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6231511,"mean":5.9633357285814,"rank":94560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":6135262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6231511,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155468,"mean":7.950236976336,"rank":3731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":151736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155468,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":487,"mean":8.1570740740741,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":487,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":27.432,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
