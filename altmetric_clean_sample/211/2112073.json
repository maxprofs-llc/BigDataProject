In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of L. crassilabris has been obtained with PCR. The gene arrangement and composition L. crassilabris of mitochondrial genome sequence are similar to most of the other vertebrates', which contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes and a non-coding control region with the total length of 16,530\u2009bp. Except for eight tRNA and ND6 genes, other genes are encoded on heavy-strand (H-strand). Similar to most other vertebrates, the bias of G and C have universality in different region (genes). The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of L. crassilabris would contribute to better understand population genetics, conservation, biogeography, evolution of this lineage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004220","authors":["Chuanjiang Zhou","Xuzhen Wang","Dengqiang Wang","Shunping He"],"doi":"10.3109\/19401736.2013.792067","endpage":"2","first_seen_on":"2014-02-11T05:02:10+00:00","issns":["1940-1736","1940-1744"],"journal":"Mitochondrial DNA: The Journal of DNA Mapping, Sequencing & Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1392094869,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2013.792067","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2013.792067?ai=1p04&mi=3e34ke&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=MDN&"],"pmid":"24512421","pubdate":"2014-02-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"The complete mitochondrial genome of Leiocassis crassilabris (Teleostei, Siluriformes: Bagridae).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-mitochondrial-genome-ileiocassis-crassilabrisi-teleostei-siluriformes-bagridae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635033,"mean":4.9228440290343,"rank":2900989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635033,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113472,"mean":6.9176991125488,"rank":88601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113472,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":945,"mean":0.62086016949153,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":945,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":0.59383561643836,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IHC_CellBiology\/status\/433103388285222912","license":"public","citation_ids":[2112073],"posted_on":"2014-02-11T05:01:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cell Biology","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1253708030\/IHC-Twitter-profile-cell-biology2_normal.png","description":"Informa Healthcare's Cell Biology portfolio consists of 19 peer-reviewed journals designed to help you find the information you need for your research.","id_on_source":"IHC_CellBiology","tweeter_id":"140452905","geo":{"lt":"51.5072759","ln":"-0.1276597","country":"GB"},"followers":515},"tweet_id":"433103388285222912"}]}}
