FAT10 is conjugated to its substrates via the bispecific, ubiquitin-activating and FAT10-activating enzyme UBA6, the likewise bispecific conjugating enzyme UBA6-specific E2 enzyme 1 (USE1), and possibly E3 ligases. By MS analysis, we found that USE1 undergoes self-FAT10ylation in cis, mainly at Lys323. Mutation of Lys323 to an arginine did not abolish auto-FAT10ylation of USE1, but every other lysine could instead be modified with FAT10. Similarly to bulk FAT10 substrates, FAT10ylation of USE1 accelerated its proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, the USE1-FAT10 conjugate continued to be an active E2 enzyme, because both FAT10 and ubiquitin could still be thioester-linked to the USE1-FAT10 conjugate. We therefore suggest that the major function of USE1 auto-FAT10ylation is to serve as a negative feedback mechanism to limit the conjugation of FAT10 upon its cytokine-mediated induction by reducing the amount of USE1 through proteasomal degradation of the USE1-FAT10 conjugate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b6","authors":["Aichem, Annette","Catone, Nicola","Groettrup, Marcus"],"doi":"10.1111\/febs.12745","endpage":"1859","first_seen_on":"2014-02-13T21:34:19+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1742-4658","1742-464X"],"issue":"7","journal":"FEBS Journal","last_mentioned_on":1392364002,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/febs.12745\/abstract;jsessionid=3CB438079BB5221210407CFFED4115F8.f03t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/febs.12745\/pdf","pmid":"24528925","pubdate":"2014-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1848","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Investigations into the auto\u2010FAT10ylation of the bispecific E2 conjugating enzyme USE1","type":"article","volume":"281","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigations-autofat10ylation-bispecific-e2-conjugating-enzyme-uba6specific-e2-enzyme-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6647887,"mean":6.1572426711261,"rank":3171196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1982700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6647887,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190091,"mean":7.1570291020046,"rank":88459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":77972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190091,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2100,"mean":1.7802353501667,"rank":711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2100,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":0.82283116883117,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
