It's Bacillus subtilis w\/ plasmids labeled in pink -"],"citation":{"abstract":"In bacteria, some plasmids are partitioned to daughter cells by assembly of actin-like proteins (ALPs). The best understood ALP, ParM, has a core set of biochemical properties that contributes to its function, including dynamic instability, spontaneous nucleation, and bidirectional elongation. AlfA, an ALP that pushes plasmids apart in Bacillus, relies on a different set of underlying properties to segregate DNA. AlfA elongates unidirectionally and is not dynamically unstable; its assembly and disassembly are regulated by a cofactor, AlfB. Free AlfB breaks up AlfA bundles and promotes filament turnover. However, when AlfB is bound to the centromeric DNA sequence, parN, it forms a segrosome complex that nucleates and stabilizes AlfA filaments. When reconstituted in vitro, this system creates polarized, motile comet tails that associate by antiparallel filament bundling to form bipolar, DNA-segregating spindles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Polka JK","Kollman JM","Mullins RD"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1304127111","first_seen_on":"2014-02-10T14:06:37+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"6","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1454106604,"links":["http:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/718258028","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1304127111","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/6\/2176"],"pmid":"24481252","pubdate":"2014-02-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Accessory factors promote AlfA-dependent plasmid segregation by regulating filament nucleation, disassembly, and bundling.","type":"article","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/accessory-factors-promote-alfadependent-plasmid-segregation-regulating-filament-nucleation-disassemb"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060796,"mean":6.2779102203052,"rank":1593384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5436665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060796,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191849,"mean":7.1679046119847,"rank":47072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":143887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191849,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42529,"mean":21.893869638826,"rank":19303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":22935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42529,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":952,"mean":36.773903259727,"rank":543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":952,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
