Therefore, this parametric study was designed to compare the effect of binaural and monaural stimuli presentation on speech-evoked ABR features in the parallel assessment of subcortical asymmetry of speech stimuli acoustic elements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b21","authors":["Mohsen Ahadi","Akram Pourbakht","Amir Homayoun Jafari","Shohre Jalaie"],"doi":"10.3109\/14992027.2013.866281","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2014-02-11T08:21:00+00:00","issns":["1499-2027","1708-8186"],"journal":"International Journal of Audiology","last_mentioned_on":1392116106,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/14992027.2013.866281"],"pmid":"24506562","pubdate":"2014-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Informa Healthcare Stockholm","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["audiology"],"title":"Effects of stimulus presentation mode and subcortical laterality in speech-evoked auditory brainstem responses.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-stimulus-presentation-mode-subcortical-laterality-speechevoked-auditory-brainstem-responses-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505550,"mean":5.102354651723,"rank":2346879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1493137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505550,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126937,"mean":7.6261938929856,"rank":62723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":42144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126937,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":437,"mean":1.945247706422,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":437,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.6272727272727,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Neuroscience":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/just_aud_stuff\/status\/433153518418264064","license":"public","citation_ids":[2112274],"posted_on":"2014-02-11T08:20:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Just Audiology Stuff","url":"http:\/\/justaudiologystuff.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000015310827\/8d94e7f3a82a7240f0fce6a6df6e4957_normal.jpeg","description":"Just Audiology Stuff is a blog covering all facets of commercial strategy in hearing healthcare.
