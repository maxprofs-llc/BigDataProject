The Arf1\/COPI protein machinery, known for its role in vesicle trafficking, regulates LD morphology, targeting of specific proteins to LDs and lipolysis through unclear mechanisms. Recent evidence shows that Arf1\/COPI can bud nano-LDs (\u223c60 nm diameter) from phospholipid-covered oil\/water interfaces in vitro. We show that Arf1\/COPI proteins localize to cellular LDs, are sufficient to bud nano-LDs from cellular LDs, and are required for targeting specific TG-synthesis enzymes to LD surfaces. Cells lacking Arf1\/COPI function have increased amounts of phospholipids on LDs, resulting in decreased LD surface tension and impairment to form bridges to the ER. Our findings uncover a function for Arf1\/COPI proteins at LDs and suggest a model in which Arf1\/COPI machinery acts to control ER-LD connections for localization of key enzymes of TG storage and catabolism.
