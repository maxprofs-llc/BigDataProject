It is debated whether one or two NPFs are required for activation. Here we present evidence in support of the two-NPF model and show that actin plays a crucial role in the interactions of two mammalian NPFs, N-WASP and WAVE2, with Arp2\/3 complex. Competition between actin-WCA and glia maturation factor (GMF) for binding to Arp2\/3 complex suggests that during activation the first actin monomer binds at the barbed end of Arp2. Based on distance constraints obtained by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we define the relative position of the two actin-WCAs on Arp2\/3 complex and propose an atomic model of the 11-subunit transitional complex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Malgorzata Boczkowska","Grzegorz Rebowski","David J.
