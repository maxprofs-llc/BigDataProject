Localizing the delivery of glaucoma drugs, such as timolol maleate (TM), can minimize adverse effects caused by systemic administration. Although eye drops and drug-soaked lenses allow for local treatment, their utility is limited by burst release and a lack of sustained therapeutic delivery. Additionally, wet transportation and storage of drug-soaked lenses result in drug loss due to elution from the lenses. Here we present a nanodiamond (ND)-embedded contact lens capable of lysozyme-triggered release of TM for sustained therapy. We find that ND-embedded lenses composed of enzyme-cleavable polymers allow for controlled and sustained release of TM in the presence of lysozyme. Retention of drug activity is verified in primary human trabecular meshwork cells. These results demonstrate the translational potential of an ND-embedded lens capable of drug sequestration and enzyme activation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Ho-Joong Kim","Kim HJ","Zhang K","Moore L","Ho D"],"doi":"10.1021\/nn5002968","endpage":"3005","first_seen_on":"2014-02-13T02:35:58+00:00","funders":["nci","nigms"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1936-0851","1936-086X"],"issue":"3","journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1424457540,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn5002968","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1021\/nn5002968","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/nn5002968","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24506583"],"pmid":"24506583","pubdate":"2014-02-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2998","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Diamond Nanogel-Embedded Contact Lenses Mediate Lysozyme-Dependent Therapeutic Release","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diamond-nanogelembedded-contact-lenses-mediate-lysozymedependent-therapeutic-release"},"altmetric_score":{"score":83.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":83.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":97033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7932415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200171,"mean":7.3775698955889,"rank":2939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":197231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200171,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4902,"mean":11.940368088145,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":4748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4902,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272,"mean":9.3041992619926,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
