In neurons and astrocytes, A\u03b242-os enhance the transcription of A\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) and \u03b2-secretase\/BACE1 genes. Thus, by acting together with \u03b3-secretase, the surpluses of APP and BACE1 amplify the endogenous production of A\u03b242-os which pile up, damage mitochondria, and are oversecreted. At the plasmalemma, exogenous A\u03b242-os bind neurons' and astrocytes' calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) activating a set of intracellular signaling pathways which upkeep A\u03b242-os intracellular accumulation and oversecretion by hindering A\u03b242-os proteolysis. In addition, A\u03b242-os accumulating in the extracellular milieu spread and reach mounting numbers of adjacent and remoter teams of neurons and astrocytes which in turn are recruited, again via A\u03b242-os\u2022CaSR-governed mechanisms, to produce and release additional A\u03b242-os amounts. This relentless self-sustaining mechanism drives AD progression toward upper cortical areas. Later on accumulating A\u03b242-os elicit the advent of hyperphosphorylated (p)-Tau oligomers which acting together with A\u03b242-os and other glial neurotoxins cooperatively destroy wider and wider cognition-related cortical areas. In parallel, A\u03b242-os\u2022CaSR signals also elicit an excess production and secretion of nitric oxide and vascular endothelial growth factor-A from astrocytes, of A\u03b242-os and myelin basic protein from oligodendrocytes, and of proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide and (likely) A\u03b242-os from microglia. Activated astrocytes and microglia survive the toxic onslaught, whereas neurons and oligodendrocytes increasingly die. However, we have shown that highly selective allosteric CaSR antagonists (calcilytics), like NPS 2143 and NPS 89626, efficiently suppress all the neurotoxic effects A\u03b242-os\u2022CaSR signaling drives in cultured cortical untransformed human neurons and astrocytes. In fact, calcilytics increase A\u03b242 proteolysis and discontinue the oversecretion of A\u03b242-os, nitric oxide, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A from both astrocytes and neurons. Seemingly, calcilytics would also benefit the other types of glial cells and cerebrovascular cells otherwise damaged by the effects of A\u03b242-os\u2022CaSR signaling. Thus, given at amnestic minor cognitive impairment (aMCI) or initial symptomatic stages, calcilytics could prevent or terminate the propagation of LOAD neuropathology and preserve human neurons' viability and hence patients' cognitive abilities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc19","authors":["Chiarini, Anna","Armato, Ubaldo","Liu, Daisong","Dal Pr\u00e0, Ilaria"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphys.2016.00134","first_seen_on":"2016-04-26T07:43:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-042X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1464390862,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphys.2016.00134\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27199760?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27199760?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27199760"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphys.2016.00134\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4844916","pmid":"27199760","pubdate":"2016-04-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Calcium-Sensing Receptors of Human Neural Cells Play Crucial Roles in Alzheimer's Disease","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calciumsensing-receptors-human-neural-cells-play-crucial-roles-alzheimers-disease-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":717710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7096216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268667,"mean":11.404912955119,"rank":37170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":231025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268667,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2627,"mean":5.2454341203351,"rank":236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2627,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":9.3035538461538,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
