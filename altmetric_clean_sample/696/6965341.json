Evaporation is a simple yet effective method to realize a gold nanoparticle ordered self-assembly, but until now, little attention has been paid to viewing the corresponding assembly process. Herein, with the help of dark-field microscopy, we in situ monitored the whole dynamic process of gold nanorod (GNR) assembly as the solvent evaporated. Differently from the previous coffee-ring effect, rod-shaped hydrophilic GNRs, within certain concentrations, spontaneously assembled into a multiple-ring pattern on a hydrophobic substrate via droplet drying. The self-assembly mechanism is consistent with a diffusion-driven kinetics, and the influencing factors, including the GNR surface modification, the colloid concentration, the surface property of the substrate, and the shape of the nanoparticles, were systematically investigated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Li, Hui","Luo, Hao","Zhang, Zhen","Li, Yongjun","Xiong, Bin","Qiao, Chunyan","Cao, Xuan","Wang, Tie","He, Yan","Jing, Guangyin"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6cp00593d","first_seen_on":"2016-04-26T11:06:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1463-9084","1463-9076"],"journal":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP)","last_mentioned_on":1461665570,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27108655?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27108655","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Direct observation of nanoparticle multiple-ring pattern formation during droplet evaporation with dark-field microscopy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-observation-nanoparticle-multiplering"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":5756814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1020592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267112,"mean":11.387684805193,"rank":187174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267112,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3569,"mean":2.1763951793722,"rank":1887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3569,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":1.8375,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Chemistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/assembly_papers\/statuses\/724904058004357120","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6965341],"posted_on":"2016-04-26T10:12:50+00:00","author":{"name":"assemblypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439371508528320512\/TDJfUNti_normal.png","description":"Papers on directed and self assembly","id_on_source":"assembly_papers","tweeter_id":"2364079946","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":332},"tweet_id":"724904058004357120"}]}}
