However, the impacts of seipin in stroke remain unclear.\nIn this study, we subjected seipin knockout mice to cerebral ischemia\/reperfusion injury and found that seipin knockout mice exhibited exacerbated neurological disorder and enlarged infarct size, companied by blood-brain barrier (BBB) damages. Furthermore, we showed that seipin knockout aggravated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and significantly increased glucose levels, decreased leptin and adiponectin levels in mouse plasma.\nOur findings reveal that seipin knockout exacerbates cerebral I\/R-induced damages by increasing BBB permeability, amplifying ER stress and increasing glucose levels, as well as decreasing leptin and adiponectin levels, indicating that seipin may be a potential therapeutic target for stroke.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Chen, Yong","Wei, Lili","Tian, Jing","Wang, Yu-Hui","Liu, George","Wang, Chun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2016.04.116","first_seen_on":"2016-04-26T11:18:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2104"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1461666429,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27109482?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27109482","pubdate":"2016-04-26T22:01:38+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Seinpin knockout exacerbates cerebral ischemia\/reperfusion damage in mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seinpin-knockout-exacerbates-cerebral-ischemiareperfusion-damage-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":3933733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2132481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267111,"mean":11.387716206806,"rank":145046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":95483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267111,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8131,"mean":2.7309249692497,"rank":5544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8131,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227,"mean":3.7789734513274,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
