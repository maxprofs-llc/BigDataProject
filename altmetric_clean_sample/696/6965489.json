Astragaloside\u00a0IV (AS-IV) is a saponin isolated from Astragalus\u00a0membranaceus, which possesses various pharmacological activities. AS\u2011IV prevents podocyte apoptosis and ameliorates renal injury in DN; however, few studies have focused on its effects on ion channels. The transient receptor potential channel\u00a06\u00a0(TRPC6) is an important Ca2+\u2011permeable ion channel in podocytes, which is involved in high glucose (HG)-induced podocyte apoptosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether AS\u2011IV prevented HG\u2011induced podocyte apoptosis via TRPC6. Cultured podocytes were pre\u2011treated with 10,\u00a020\u00a0or\u00a040\u00a0\u00b5M AS\u2011IV for 1\u00a0h prior to HG exposure for 24\u00a0h. Apoptosis, cell viability, expression of TRPC6, nuclear factor of activated T\u00a0cells (NFAT2) and B\u2011cell lymphoma\u00a02\u2011associated X protein (Bax), as well as the intracellular Ca2+ concentration were subsequently analyzed. The results indicated that HG induced podocyte apoptosis and upregulation of TRPC6, and increased intracellular Ca2+. Furthermore, enhanced NFAT2 and Bax expression was detected. Conversely, AS\u2011IV protected HG\u2011induced podocyte apoptosis, downregulated TRPC6 expression and suppressed intracellular Ca2+ in HG-stimulated podocytes. AS\u2011IV also suppressed NFAT2 and Bax expression. These results suggest that AS\u2011IV may prevent HG-induced podocyte apoptosis via downregulation of TRPC6, which is possibly mediated via the calcineurin\/NFAT signaling pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Yao, Xing-Mei","Liu, Yu-Jun","Wang, Yun-Man","Wang, Hao","Zhu, Bing-Bing","Liang, Yong-Ping","Yao, Wei-Guo","Yu, Hui","Wang, Nian-Song","Zhang, Xue-Mei","Peng, Wen","Yao,Xing\u2011Mei ","Liu,Yu\u2011Jun ","Wang,Yun\u2011Man ","Wang,Hao ","Zhu,Bing\u2011Bing ","Liang,Yong\u2011Ping ","Yao,Wei\u2011Guo ","Yu,Hui ","Wang,Nian\u2011Song ","Zhang,Xue\u2011Mei ","Peng,Wen "],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2016.5167","first_seen_on":"2016-04-26T11:10:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-3004","1791-2997"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1464831860,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27109610?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27109610","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3892\/mmr.2016.5167"],"pmid":"27109610","pubdate":"2016-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Astragaloside IV prevents high glucose-induced podocyte apoptosis via downregulation of TRPC6","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/astragaloside-iv-prevents-high-glucoseinduced-podocyte-apoptosis-via-downregulation-trpc6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":5951932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1050154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268858,"mean":11.411463930639,"rank":188070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268858,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1937,"mean":1.4214473140496,"rank":704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1937,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178,"mean":0.98050847457627,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/trp_papers\/statuses\/724905399632183297","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6965489],"posted_on":"2016-04-26T10:18:10+00:00","author":{"name":"trppapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"trp_papers","tweeter_id":"4731026308","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":46},"tweet_id":"724905399632183297"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Astragaloside IV prevents high glucose-induced podocyte apoptosis via downregulation of TRPC6. -...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1186942184649959&id=522092711134913","license":"public","citation_ids":[6965489,6965489],"posted_on":"2016-06-02T01:44:20+00:00","summary":"The herb Astragalus, prevents kidney cell damage in diabetes.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27109610","author":{"name":"Harvest Health Productions- Harvesthealth.thinkific.com","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/522092711134913","facebook_wall_name":"Harvest Health Productions- Harvesthealth.thinkific.com","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/522092711134913\/picture","id_on_source":"522092711134913"}}]}}
