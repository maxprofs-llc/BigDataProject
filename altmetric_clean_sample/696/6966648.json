For asking questions on how food webs are built and work, we need descriptions of food webs at different levels of resolution. DNA techniques provide opportunities for highly resolved webs. In this paper, we offer an expos\u00e9 of how DNA-based techniques, and DNA barcodes in particular, have recently been used to construct food web structure in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. We highlight how such techniques can be applied to simultaneously improve the taxonomic resolution of the nodes of the web (i.e., the species), and the links between them (i.e., who eats whom). We end by proposing how DNA barcodes and DNA information may allow new approaches to the construction of larger interaction webs, and overcome some hurdles to achieving adequate sample size. Most importantly, we propose that the joint adoption and development of these techniques may serve to unite approaches to food web studies in aquatic and terrestrial systems-revealing the extent to which food webs in these environments are structured similarly to or differently from each other, and how they are linked by dispersal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c44","authors":["Tomas Roslin","Sanna Majaneva"," Tomas Roslin"," Sanna Majaneva"],"doi":"10.1139\/gen-2015-0229","endpage":"628","first_seen_on":"2016-04-26T11:54:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0831-2796","1480-3321"],"issue":"9","journal":"Genome","last_mentioned_on":1479563331,"links":["http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/gen-2015-0229#.Vx9OgzTZGHN.twitter","http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/gen-2015-0229#.VztzMKSUQsy.twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1139\/gen-2015-0229","http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/gen-2015-0229?src=recsys","http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/gen-2015-0229"],"pmid":"27484156","pubdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" NRC Research Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"603","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"The use of DNA barcodes in food web construction \u2013 terrestrial and aquatic ecologists unite!","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dna-barcodes-food-web-constructionterrestrial-aquatic-ecologists-unite-sup1sup"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.016,"score_history":{"1y":7.766,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.016},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715105,"mean":6.6184650148513,"rank":743750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6971079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715105,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268198,"mean":11.395370142096,"rank":39126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":229071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268198,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":498,"mean":2.7372515090543,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":498,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":5.4294482758621,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
