We created a survey questionnaire and asked three groups, namely, occupational physicians, occupational health nurses, and health officers, to rate the importance of each practical ability.\nThe mean scores for all 45 items were greater than 4, i.e., in the middle of the 7-point Likert scale, for all the three groups. The occupational physicians' responses had a correlation with the other groups' responses. However, there were differences with regard to some practical abilities between the three groups. Five practical abilities from the top quartile were marked \"A\" by all the three groups: \"Submit opinions on fitness for duty and work accommodation on the basis of data from health examination,\" \"Respect employee privacy,\" \"Submit opinion on fitness for duty and work accommodation on the basis of data from face-to-face interviews with employees,\" \"Submit opinions on fitness for duty and work accommodation on the basis of data from health surveillance,\" and \"Implement face-to-face interviews for employees who have worked overtime and evaluate the subjects' conditions including mental and physical health status, degree of accumulated fatigue, and depression.\"\nThis study resulted in a rank-ordered list of 45 practical abilities that are required by nonspecialist occupational physicians. This result may be useful to review and redesign the existing training program for nonspecialist occupational physicians.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dad","authors":["Nagata, Masako","Mori, Koji","Ishikawa, Asako","Nagata, Tomohisa"],"doi":"10.1539\/joh.15-0224-oa","first_seen_on":"2016-04-26T12:38:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1348-9585","1341-9145"],"journal":"Journal of Occupational Health","last_mentioned_on":1461673070,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27108644?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27108644","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Surveys on Minimum Practical Abilities Required by Nonspecialist Occupational Physicians in Japan","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surveys-minimum-practical-abilities-required-nonspecialist-occupational-physicians-japan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":6587188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267112,"mean":11.387659347612,"rank":223938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267112,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":3.110495049505,"rank":183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.3875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
