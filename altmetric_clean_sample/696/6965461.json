Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure is the largest trial in acutely decompensated heart failure (HF) with patients from 5 geographical regions: North America (NA), Latin America (LA), Western Europe (WE), Central Europe (CE), and Asia-Pacific (AP). Data from the 5 geographical areas were compared including baseline characteristics, medications, 30-day outcomes (mortality and mortality or HF hospitalization), and 180-day mortality. Of the 7,141 study patients, 3,243 (45.4%) were from NA (average of 15.2 patients\/site), 1,762 (24.7%) from AP (28.4 patients\/site), 967 (13.5%) from CE (20.2 patients\/site), 665 (9.3%) from LA (17.1 patients\/site), and 504 (7.1%) from WE (14.4 patients\/site). There were marked differences in co-morbidities, clinical profile, medication use, length of stay, 30-day event rates, and 180-day mortality by region. Compared with NA, the adjusted risk for death or HF hospitalization at 30 days was significantly lower in CE (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.64), WE (OR 0.52 95% CI 0.35 to 0.75), and AP (OR 0.62 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79) and numerically lower in LA (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.04) with similar results for 180-day mortality. In conclusion, in patients with acutely decompensated HF, major differences in baseline characteristics, treatments, length of the hospital stay, and 30-day HF rehospitalization rates, and 180-day mortality were found in patients enrolled from different geographical areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","authors":["Metra, Marco","Mentz, Robert J","Hernandez, Adrian F","Heizer, Gretchen M","Armstrong, Paul W","Clausell, Nadine","Corbalan, Ramon","Costanzo, Maria Rosa","Dickstein, Kenneth","Dunlap, Mark E","Ezekowitz, Justin A","Howlett, Jonathan G","Komajda, Michel","Krum, Henry","Lombardi, Carlo","Fonarow, Gregg C","McMurray, John J V","Nieminen, Markku S","Swedberg, Karl","Voors, Adriaan A","Starling, Randall C","Teerlink, John R","O'Connor, Christopher M","Marco Metra","Robert J.
