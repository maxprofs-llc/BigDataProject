To perform optimally, these formulations must compete favorably with non-toxic alternative foods present within the insect's habitat. We hypothesized that the nutritional history of cockroaches and their acceptance or avoidance of glucose would affect their food preference and thus bait efficacy. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment, first providing glucose-accepting and glucose-averse cockroaches nutritionally defined diets and then offering them identical diets containing the insecticide hydramethylnon as a bait proxy to evaluate the effect of diets of differing macronutrient composition on bait performance.\nThe interaction between diet composition and bait composition affected the survival of adult males as well as first instar nymphs exposed to excretions produced by these males. Survival analyses indicated different responses of glucose-averse and glucose-accepting insects, but generally, any combination of diet and bait that resulted in high diet intake and low bait intake decreased secondary kill.\nThis study represents a comprehensive examination of the effect of alternative foods on bait efficacy. We suggest that disparities between the nutritional quality of baits and the foods that are naturally available could profoundly impact the management of German cockroach infestations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100066eb","authors":["Ko, Alexander E.","Schal, Coby","Silverman, Jules","Ko, Alexander E"],"doi":"10.1002\/ps.4295","endpage":"1836","first_seen_on":"2016-04-26T14:48:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1526-4998"],"issue":"10","journal":"Pest Management Science","last_mentioned_on":1468848080,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ps.4295\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ps.4295\/abstract;jsessionid=D54E64A6E4FB668A579E70F8A8666988.f04t03?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ps.4295\/abstract;jsessionid=D54E64A6E4FB668A579E70F8A8666988.f04t03?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage="],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ps.4295\/pdf","pmid":"27098845","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1826","title":"Diet quality affects bait performance in German cockroaches (Dictyoptera: Blattellidae)","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diet-quality-affects-bait-performance-german-cockroaches-dictyoptera-blattellidae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083793,"mean":6.8666882938024,"rank":5850434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1946308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083793,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270663,"mean":11.519532797363,"rank":173036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":81700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270663,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":816,"mean":3.704363190184,"rank":508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":816,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.6214857142857,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AR":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InsectNeurobiol\/statuses\/724966623069753344","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6969379],"posted_on":"2016-04-26T14:21:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Lab.Insect.Neurobiol","url":"https:\/\/labneurobiologiainsectos.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/705755434909573120\/bXvrnh4P_normal.jpg","description":"Laboratory of Insect Neurobiology -
