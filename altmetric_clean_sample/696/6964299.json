Biochanin A, a phytoestrogen compound found mainly in Trifolium pratense, was used in the present study as a potential alternative to estrogen replacement therapy via the investigation of its neuroprotective effects against A\u03b225-35-induced toxicity, as well as of its potential mechanisms of action in PC12 cells. Exposure of these cells to the A\u03b225-35 protein significantly increased cell viability loss and apoptosis. However, the effects induced by A\u03b225-35 were markedly reversed in the present of biochanin A. Pretreatment with biochanin A attenuated the cytotoxic effect of the A\u03b225-35 protein by decreasing viability loss, LDH release, and caspase activity in cells. Moreover, we found that expression of cytochrome c and Puma were reduced, alongside with the restoration of Bcl-2\/Bax and Bcl-xL\/Bax ratio in the presence of biochanin A, which led to a decrease in the apoptotic rate. These data demonstrate that mitochondria are involved in the protective effect of biochanin A against A\u03b225-35 and that this drug attenuated A\u03b225-35-induced PC12 cell injury and apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, biochanin A might raise a possibility as a potential therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease and other related neurodegenerative diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Ji Tan","Tan, Ji Wei","Kim, Min Kyu"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules21050548","first_seen_on":"2016-04-26T09:21:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"5","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1461847545,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/5\/548","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27120593?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/5\/548\/pdf","pmid":"27120593","pubdate":"2016-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"548","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Neuroprotective Effects of Biochanin A against \u03b2-Amyloid-Induced Neurotoxicity in PC12 Cells via a Mitochondrial-Dependent Apoptosis Pathway","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuroprotective-effects-biochanin-against-amyloidinduced-neurotoxicity-pc12-cells-via-mitochondriald"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":3941969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2137835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267337,"mean":11.388328657569,"rank":145138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":95686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267337,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3447,"mean":2.1179907138712,"rank":1017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3447,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":2.1372653061224,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
