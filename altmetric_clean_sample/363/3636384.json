This test eliminates many potential problems inherent in any free-field localization test such as calibration problems, problems replicating source and listener locations, and issues associated with head movements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100058a1","authors":["J M Besing","J Koehnke"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T21:54:14+00:00","issns":["0196-0202"],"issue":"2","journal":"Ear and hearing (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1377382247,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7789673"],"pmid":"7789673","pubdate":"1995-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["audiology"],"title":"A test of virtual auditory localization.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/test-virtual-auditory-localization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":817061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95933,"mean":8.1873807905602,"rank":25003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95933,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":661,"mean":2.3986666666667,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":661,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":3.2192307692308,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
