The putative 996 amino acids protein presents the domain organization typical of the Nacht, Leucine rich repeat and Pyrin domain containing (NALP) family that includes the maternal effect factor MATER. By reverse transcription coupled to polymerase chain reaction, we have analyzed expression of NALP9 in a panel of somatic and gonadic tissues and during in vitro preimplantation development. The transcript was detected exclusively in testis and ovary, and at a remarkably high level in the oocyte from antral follicles. NALP9 mRNA remained present after in vitro maturation and fertilization, and was detected in embryos, but transcription was not reactivated at the maternal to embryo transition. Thus NALP9 is characterized as a novel oocyte marker gene in cattle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e9","authors":["Dalbi\u00e8s\u2010Tran, Rozenn","Papillier, Pascal","Pennetier, Sophie","Uzbekova, Svetlana","Monget, Philippe"],"doi":"10.1002\/mrd.20298","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T19:20:15+00:00","issns":["1098-2795"],"journal":"Molecular Reproduction and Development","last_mentioned_on":1276467253,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/mrd.20298","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15892040"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mrd.20298\/pdf","pmid":"15892040","pubdate":"2005-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Bovine mater-like NALP9 is an oocyte marker gene.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bovine-materlike-nalp9-oocyte-marker-gene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627694,"mean":4.9472740289804,"rank":817527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627694,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95740,"mean":8.1463343882849,"rank":24917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95740,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327,"mean":1.6408711656442,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.82142857142857,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
