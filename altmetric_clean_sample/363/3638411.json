Different treatment modes are used for its therapy. Classical is the combination of 50 mg of pyrimethamine with 4 g of sulphadiazine and corticosteroids. In this study the results of treatment with lower doses of pyrimethamine together with long-acting sulphonamide are reported. Twelve patients were treated with Fansidar, combination of 25 mg of pyrimethamine and 500 mg sulphadoxine. The treatment consisted of a loading dose of two tablets of Fansidar, followed by one tablet a day. Prednisone 0.5 mg\/kg\/day was added and gradually tapered off. Patients were treated for 28 days on average (range 21-50 days). In 83% of patients the scar was considerably smaller than original lesion (on average the scar represented 25% of original lesion). Three months after the treatment the visual acuity was 6\/9 or better in 83% of patients. No side-effects of the treatment were observed. Lower doses of pyrimethamine with suphadoxine in an easy once a day treatment regime could be an alternative and cost-effective therapy for ocular toxoplasmosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000cccb","authors":["K Michalov\u00e1","E R\u00edhov\u00e1","M Havl\u00edkov\u00e1"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T22:56:10+00:00","issns":["1211-9059"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cesk\u00e1 a slovensk\u00e1 oftalmologie casopis Cesk\u00e9 oftalmologick\u00e9 spolecnosti a Slovensk\u00e9 oftalmologick\u00e9 spolecnosti","last_mentioned_on":1443136629,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8768475"],"pmid":"8768475","pubdate":"1996-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"[Fansidar in the treatment of toxoplasmosis].","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fansidar-treatment-toxoplasmosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6395401,"mean":5.8554868139606,"rank":518675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":5870318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6395401,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198857,"mean":8.8582396809753,"rank":24857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":173737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198857,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":0.6359375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Some Notes Toward a Comprehensive Plan For...","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=22795243256&p=1pl&v=1&x=iYywn-3SbLHNJtKsyMUEeQ","license":"public","citation_ids":[3638411],"posted_on":"2015-09-24T23:17:09+00:00","summary":"As we all know, Rosa Parks was not the first black woman in Montgomery to be arrested for refusing to move to the back of the bus.","author":{"name":"Mother Jones","url":"http:\/\/www.motherjones.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/081\/normal\/mother_jones.png?1369846956"}}],"wikipedia":[{"title":"Sulfadoxine\/pyrimethamine","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=589916856#altmetric_citation_3","license":"public","citation_ids":[3638411],"posted_on":"2014-01-09T13:04:20+00:00","summary":"Sulfadoxine\/pyrimethamine (Fansidar) is a combination antimalarial drug containing the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfadoxine and the antiprotozoal pyrimethamine.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=32930594","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Fuse809","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Fuse809"}}]}}
