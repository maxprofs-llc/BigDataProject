NFH-LacZ transgenic mice could be distinguished from controls in the SHIRPA neurological battery by the appearance of action tremor and hindlimb clasping and a lower body weight. Despite normal exploratory activity and spatial learning, NFH-LacZ transgenic mice were deficient in stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod tests of motor coordination. These results are concordant with neuropathological findings in spinal motoneurons and the cerebellum and indicate that despite the absence of paralysis, these transgenic mice may serve as an experimental model of the early stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023af","authors":["R Lalonde","J Eyer","V Wunderle","C Strazielle"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T19:50:19+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1872-8308"],"issue":"1","journal":"Behavioural Processes","last_mentioned_on":1315991821,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12763264"],"pmid":"12763264","pubdate":"2003-05-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Characterization of NFH-LacZ transgenic mice with the SHIRPA primary screening battery and tests of motor coordination, exploratory activity, and spatial learning.","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-nfhlacz-transgenic-mice-shirpa-primary-screening-battery-tests-motor-coordination-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622323,"mean":4.9312868762118,"rank":816106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2282621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622323,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94767,"mean":7.4017396663255,"rank":24167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":69523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94767,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":421,"mean":6.1953380952381,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":421,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.95,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
