Here we identify a novel gene linked with a rare autosomal dominant form of childhood cataracts segregating in a four generation pedigree, and further show that this gene is likely associated with much more common forms of age-related cataracts in a case-control cohort.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ec8","authors":["Alan Shiels","Thomas M Bennett","Harry L S Knopf","Giovanni Maraini","Anren Li","Xiaodong Jiao","J Fielding Hejtmancik","Thomas M.
