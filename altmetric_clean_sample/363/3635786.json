This higher-order instability arises from the nonlinear superposition of elementary instabilities, associated with initial single breather evolution followed by a regime of complex, yet deterministic, pulse splitting. We analytically describe the process using the Darboux transformation and compare with experiments in optical fiber. We show how a suitably low frequency modulation on a continuous wave field induces higher-order modulation instability splitting with the pulse characteristics at different phases of evolution related by a simple scaling relationship. We anticipate that similar processes are likely to be observed in many other systems including plasmas, Bose-Einstein condensates, and deep water waves.","ads_id":"2011PhRvL.107y3901E","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Miro Erkintalo","Kamal Hammani","Bertrand Kibler","Christophe Finot","Nail Akhmediev","John M.
