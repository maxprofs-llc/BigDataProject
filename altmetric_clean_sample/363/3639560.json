Six victims were brought dead, while 17 (6%) died later owing to multiorgan failure with loss of consciousness and convulsions (who reported after 24 hours of sting). Early administration of prazosin (125-250 ug orally) improved the clinical symptoms. Morbidity and mortality due to scorpion envenoming depends upon time lapse between sting and administration of post synaptic alpha-1 blocker, prazosin hydrochloride.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007754","authors":["H S Bawaskar","P H Bawaskar"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T23:31:40+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0019-5456"],"issue":"3","journal":"Indian Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1271274633,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10771989"],"pmid":"10771989","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Indian red scorpion envenoming.","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/indian-red-scorpion-envenoming"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":815953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96673,"mean":8.2431041252899,"rank":25326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96673,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":350,"mean":1.6838853868195,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":350,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.0805555555556,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
