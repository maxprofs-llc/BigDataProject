A candidate tumor suppressor gene on 22q is the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene since NF2 patients have an increased susceptibility to ependymomas and astrocytomas. Using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct DNA sequencing, we screened 8 ependymomas and 30 fibrillary astrocytomas from non-NF2 patients for mutations in the coding sequence and portions of the 3' untranslated region of the NF2 gene. Only one mutation was detected, a single base deletion in NF2 exon 7 from a spinal ependymoma, which had also lost the wild-type allele. These results suggest that the NF2 gene may be important in the formation of some ependymomas but the NF2 gene is probably not the critical chromosome 22q tumor suppressor gene involved in astrocytoma tumorigenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["M P Rubio","K M Correa","V Ramesh","M M MacCollin","L B Jacoby","A von Deimling","J F Gusella","D N Louis"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T21:40:26+00:00","issns":["0008-5472"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1312628698,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8261460"],"pmid":"8261460","pubdate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Analysis of the neurofibromatosis 2 gene in human ependymomas and astrocytomas.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-neurofibromatosis-2-gene-human-ependymomas-astrocytomas-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":816299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96161,"mean":8.212954409318,"rank":25089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96161,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4931,"mean":4.0876705882353,"rank":930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4931,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":2.7935342465753,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
