It is composed of three domains: an amino-terminal SacI homology region, a central inositol 5'-phosphatase homology region, and a carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region. We have now identified and characterized a novel form of synaptojanin, synaptojanin 2, which has a broader tissue distribution. Synaptojanin 2 cDNA from rat brain library encodes a protein of 1,248 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 138,268. The two synaptojanin isoforms share 57.2 and 53.8% amino acid identity in their SacI and phosphatase domains, respectively. In marked contrast, their carboxyl-terminal proline-rich regions bear little homology. Expression of synaptojanin 2 in COS7 cells produced a 140-kDa protein with inositol 5'-phosphatase actvity. Protein binding assays demonstrated that among the major src homology 3-proteins known to bind to the proline-rich region of synaptojanin 1, Grb2, amphiphysin, and members of SH3p4\/8\/13 protein family, only Grb2 bound to that of synaptojanin 2. Furthermore, subcellular fractionation studies in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed that synaptojanin 2 was predominantly associated with the particulate fraction while synaptojanin 1 was mainly localized in the soluble fraction. This observation suggests that the proline-rich regions of synaptojanins 1 and 2 are implicated in different protein-protein interactions and direct the two isoforms to different subcellular compartments. Our results demonstrate the presence of a family of synaptojanin-type inositol 5'-phosphatases with different tissue and subcellular distributions, which may be involved in distinct membrane trafficking and signal transduction pathways in mammalian cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Y Nemoto","M Arribas","C Haffner","P DeCamilli"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T19:55:31+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"49","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1300025975,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9388224"],"pmid":"9388224","pubdate":"1997-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Synaptojanin 2, a novel synaptojanin isoform with a distinct targeting domain and expression pattern.","type":"article","volume":"272","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synaptojanin-2-novel-synaptojanin-isoform-distinct-targeting-domain-expression-pattern"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":816886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95983,"mean":8.1950173157469,"rank":25025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95983,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6431886166685,"rank":1753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231,"mean":2.4842782608696,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
