During a 3-year period, a binational team implemented an active, sentinel surveillance system for hepatitis and febrile exanthems at 13 clinical sites. The network developed surveillance protocols, trained nine surveillance coordinators, established serologic testing at four Mexican border laboratories, and created agreements for data sharing and notification of selected diseases and outbreaks. BIDS facilitated investigations of dengue fever in Texas-Tamaulipas and measles in California-Baja California. BIDS demonstrates that a binational effort with local, state, and federal participation can create a regional surveillance system that crosses an international border. Reducing administrative, infrastructure, and political barriers to cross-border public health collaboration will enhance the effectiveness of disease prevention projects such as BIDS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027bd","authors":["Michelle Weinberg","Stephen Waterman","Carlos Alvarez Lucas","Veronica Carrion Falcon","Pablo Kuri Morales","Luis Anaya Lopez","Chris Peter","Alejandro Escobar Guti\u00e9rrez","Ernesto Ramirez Gonzalez","Ana Flisser","Ralph Bryan","Enrique Navarro Valle","Alfonso Rodriguez","Gerardo Alvarez Hernandez","Cecilia Rosales","Javier Arias Ortiz","Michael Landen","Hugo Vilchis","Julie Rawlings","Francisco Lopez Leal","Luis Ortega","Elaine Flagg","Roberto Tapia Conyer","Martin Cetron","M.
