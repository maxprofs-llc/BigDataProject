Thirty-three and 27 nucleotide variants were totally observed in intron 7 and intron 9, respectively (EMBL\/GenBank\/DDBJ EU372940 approximately 2). Among them, 8 variants in intron 7 and 7 in intron 9 were observed commonly in all 3 samples, whereas 2 variants in intron 7 and one in intron 9 were only found in 2 DEL samples, but not in the normal D-positive. The variants observed in intron 7 in DEL cannot explain enough for that DEL mRNA has one segment of 170 base pairs sequence from intron 7. But the nucleotides AG-GT at both sides of the segment may be related to this molecular even as AG-GT may cut intron 7 with its normal splicing site (GT-AG) into two \"new introns\" although the mechanisms are complicated in fact. We also have not found any suspicious splicing-affecting variants in intron 9 of DEL allele. However, this may make out further that the reason of whole exon 9 spliced out in DEL mRNAs may be no more than the 1227A>G mutation in DEL allele.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000368c","doi":"10.1016\/j.transci.2009.03.004","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T23:11:45+00:00","issns":["1473-0502"],"journal":"Transfusion & Apheresis Science","last_mentioned_on":1315762210,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.transci.2009.03.004","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19364677"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.trasci.com\/article\/S1473050209000548\/pdf","pmid":"19364677","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Sequencing analysis of RHD intron 7 and 9.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sequencing-analysis-rhd-intron-7-9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630679,"mean":4.9289340563991,"rank":816178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630679,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96401,"mean":8.2254920539421,"rank":25210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96401,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":1.5905176470588,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.83333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"RHD (gene)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=449854087#altmetric_citation_13","license":"public","citation_ids":[3638809],"posted_on":"2011-09-11T17:30:10+00:00","summary":"Rh blood group, D antigen also known as Rh polypeptide 1 (RhPI) or cluster of differentiation 240D (CD240D) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RHD gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=33054140","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
