Initial experiments established that infusion of SKF alone, at concentrations as low as 5 microM, increased mean LH, LH pulse amplitude, and in some cases, pulse interval. In the last experiment, animals were treated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alone, SKF alone (30 microM), 3-[[(3, 4-dichlorophenol) methyl] amino] propyl] diethoxymethyl) phosphinic acid (CGP) alone (500 microM), or SKF plus CGP. SKF increased both mean LH and LH pulse amplitude as compared with CSF. CGP alone had no significant effect on LH, but it attenuated the effect of SKF on mean LH. These observations indicate that the stimulatory effects of GABA(B) agonists on LH pulse patterns are mediated through GABA(B) receptors and provide further evidence that GABA(B) receptors located in the MBH can regulate pulsatile GnRH-LH release.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b7","authors":["Gary L Jackson","David Kuehl"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T19:12:30+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1535-3702"],"issue":"5","journal":"Experimental Biology and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1276222609,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11976401"],"pmid":"11976401","pubdate":"2002-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology","physiology"],"title":"The GABA(B) antagonist CGP 52432 attenuates the stimulatory effect of the GABA(B) agonist SKF 97541 on luteinizing hormone secretion in the male sheep.","type":"article","volume":"227","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gabab-antagonist-cgp-52432-attenuates-stimulatory-effect-gabab-agonist-skf-97541-luteinizing-hormone"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96314,"mean":8.2193184097684,"rank":25165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96314,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":437,"mean":3.1428302752294,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":437,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.075,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"SKF-97,541","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=367341376#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3631045],"posted_on":"2010-06-11T02:16:49+00:00","summary":"SKF-97,541 is a compound used in scientific research which acts primarily as a selective GABAB receptor agonist.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=27675274","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Meodipt","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Meodipt"}}]}}
