This family includes OmpT and OmpP of E. coli, SopA of Shigella flexneri, PgtE of Salmonella enterica, and Pla of Yersinia pestis. Despite their sequence similarities, the omptins vary in their reported functions. The OmpT protease is characterized by narrow cleavage specificity defined by the extracellular loops of the beta-barrel protruding above the lipid bilayer. It employs a distinct proteolytic mechanism that involves a histidine and an aspartate residue. Most of the omptin proteins have been implicated in bacterial pathogenesis. As a result, the omptins are potential targets for antimicrobial drug and vaccine development. This review summarizes recent developments in omptins structure and function, emphasizes their role in pathogenesis, proposes evolutionary relation among the existing omptins, and offers possible directions for future research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422b","doi":"10.1080\/09687680701443822","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T20:25:31+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Molecular Membrane Biology","last_mentioned_on":1302462832,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/09687680701443822","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17710644"],"pmid":"17710644","pubdate":"2007-08-21T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Omptin proteins: an expanding family of outer membrane proteases in Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/omptin-proteins-expanding-family-outer-membrane-proteases-gramnegative-enterobacteriaceae-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628118,"mean":4.9440792284301,"rank":817274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628118,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95857,"mean":8.1790716908698,"rank":24965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95857,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":1.5438303030303,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
