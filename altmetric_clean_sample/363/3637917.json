In this case, we cannot know if any item is labeled fully and correctly. When we train a classifier directly on incompletely labeled dataset, it performs ineffectively. To overcome the problem, we added an extra step, training set modification, before training a classifier. In this paper, we try two algorithms for training set modification: weighted k-nearest neighbor (WkNN) and soft supervised learning (SoftSL). Both of these approaches are based on similarity measurements between data vectors. We performed the experiments on AgingPortfolio (text dataset) and then rechecked on the Yeast (nontext genetic data). We tried SVM and RF classifiers for the original datasets and then for the modified ones. For each dataset, our experiments demonstrated that both classification algorithms performed considerably better when preceded by the training set modification step.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5223cf058f610003acc","authors":["Kolesov, Anton"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/781807","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T22:40:30+00:00","issns":["1748-670X"],"journal":"Computational & Mathematical Methods in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1409360829,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/cmmm\/2014\/781807\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24587817"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/cmmm\/2014\/781807.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3920912","pmid":"24587817","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"On multilabel classification methods of incompletely labeled biomedical text data.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multilabel-classification-methods-incompletely-labeled-biomedical-text-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4195183,"mean":5.1246661050718,"rank":979793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2651199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4195183,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138626,"mean":9.1191294932373,"rank":42979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":93744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138626,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":1.3249839572193,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
