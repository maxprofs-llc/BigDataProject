Four participant groups, young Koreans, young Americans, older Koreans, and older Americans, rated emotional expressions of Korean folksongs with three adjective scales: happiness, sadness and anger. The results of the study are in accordance with the Cue Redundancy model of emotional perception in music, indicating that expressive music embodies both universal auditory cues that communicate the emotional meanings of music across cultures and cultural specific cues that result from cultural convention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6013cf058f6100062d3","authors":["Soo-Jin Kwoun"],"doi":"10.1093\/jmt\/46.3.217","first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T23:19:04+00:00","issns":["2053-7395"],"journal":"Journal of Music Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1399706836,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/jmt\/46.3.217"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jmt.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/46\/3\/217.full.pdf","pmid":"19757877","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Performing Arts And Creative Writing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"title":"An Examination of Cue Redundancy Theory in Cross-Cultural Decoding of Emotions in Music","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/examination-cue-redundancy-theory-crosscultural-decoding-emotions-music"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3732228,"mean":4.9830419532395,"rank":848639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2359508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3732228,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112578,"mean":8.9269423949831,"rank":32946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":78359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112578,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.8922682926829,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
