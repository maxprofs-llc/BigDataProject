However, a dose of 5 mg\/kg increased striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity by 25% and homovanillic acid level by 27% when compared to control values. No change in either parameter was detected in olfactory tubercles. Dopamine levels also were elevated in striatum, pons-medulla and cerebral cortex in rats receiving 5 mg\/kg dose of MIF-1. In olfactory tubercles, dopamine levels were however, reduced to 71% of control values taken as 100%. The concentration of norepinephrine tended to increase in several brain areas examined but, the change was statistically significant only in olfactory tubercles and cerebral cortex. The level of norepinephrine metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol, was lowered to 63% in whole brain of animals given MIF-1 at the dose of 5 mg\/kg. These data suggest that MIF-1 enhances the turnover of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. However, MIF-1 treatment seemed to produce no consistent change in brain serotonin turnover. In striatum and cortex, this neuropeptide increased serotonin but elevated the level of its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid indicating that the release of this brain amine was decreased in these two brain regions. The levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were enhanced in hypothalamus and pons-medulla regardless of the dose of MIF-1 administered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e3","authors":["R L Singhal","R B Rastogi"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-14T22:01:07+00:00","issns":["0091-3057"],"issue":"2","journal":"Pharmacology, Biochemistry & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1308966792,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6122214"],"pmid":"6122214","pubdate":"1982-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","behavioralsciences","pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"MIF-1: effects on norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin metabolism in certain discrete brain regions.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mif1-effects-norepinephrine-dopamine-serotonin-metabolism-certain-discrete-brain-regions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628445,"mean":4.9414395978041,"rank":817119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628445,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95918,"mean":8.1873855937948,"rank":25001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95918,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":905,"mean":2.7754469026549,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":905,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.065625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Melanocyte-inhibiting factor","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=436074851#altmetric_citation_9","license":"public","citation_ids":[3636609,3636612],"posted_on":"2011-06-25T01:53:12+00:00","summary":"Melanocyte-inhibiting factor (also known as Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2, Melanostatin, MSH release-inhibiting hormone or MIF-1) is an endogenous peptide fragment derived from cleavage of the hormone oxytocin, but having generally different actions in the body.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=32196844","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Meodipt","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Meodipt"}}]}}
