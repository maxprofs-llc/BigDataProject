All subsequent cases developed illness 7-14 days after close physical contact with the index case while he was ill. Cases were more likely than controls to have been in the same room (100% vs. 9.5%, OR undefined, P<0.001) and to have touched him (83% vs. 0%, OR undefined, P<0.001). Although the source of infection for the index case was not identified, 50% of Pteropus bats sampled from near the outbreak area 1 month after the outbreak had antibodies to NiV confirming the presence of the virus in the area. The outbreak was spread by person-to-person transmission. Risk of NiV infection in family caregivers highlights the need for infection control practices to limit transmission of potentially infectious body secretions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006544","authors":["Homaira, N","Rahman, M","Hossain, M J","Epstein, J H","Sultana, R","Khan, M S U","Podder, G","Nahar, K","Ahmed, B","Gurley, E S","Daszak, P","Lipkin, W I","Rollin, P E","Comer, J A","Ksiazek, T G","Luby, S P","N.
