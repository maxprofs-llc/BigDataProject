This occurred at an employee influenza vaccination clinic on the premises of a New Jersey business that had contracted with the health services company to provide influenza vaccinations to its employees. The employees were to receive vaccine from manufacturer-prefilled, single-dose syringes. However, the nurse contracted by the health services company brought three multiple-dose vials of vaccine that were intended for another event. The nurse reported using two syringes she found among her supplies to administer vaccine to 67 employees of the New Jersey business. She reported wiping the syringes with alcohol and using a new needle for each of the 67 persons. One of the vaccine recipients witnessed and questioned the syringe reuse, and brought it to the attention of managers at the business who, in turn, reported the practice to the health services company contracted to provide the influenza vaccinations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5063cf058f6100030f9","authors":["Taylor, Laura","Greeley, Rebecca","Dinitz-Sklar, Jill","Mazur, Nicole","Swanson, Jill","Wolicki, JoEllen","Perz, Joseph","Tan, Christina","Montana, Barbara","Laura Taylor","Rebecca Greeley","Jill Dinitz-Sklar","Nicole Mazur","Jill Swanson","JoEllen Wolicki","Joseph Perz","Christina Tan","Barbara Montana"],"doi":"10.15585\/mmwr.mm6449a3","endpage":"1364","first_seen_on":"2016-04-14T16:01:28+00:00","issns":["1545-861X","0149-2195"],"issue":"49","journal":"MMWR: Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report","last_mentioned_on":1493512201,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26678414","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26678414\/"],"pmid":"26678414","pubdate":"2015-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1363","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"\n              Notes from the Field\n              : Injection Safety and Vaccine Administration Errors at an Employee Influenza Vaccination Clinic \u2014 New Jersey, 2015\n            ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/mmwr\/preview\/mmwrhtml\/mm6449a3.htm","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inotes-fieldi-injection-safety-vaccine-administration-errors-employee-influenza-vaccination-clinic-n"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154803,"mean":6.8922645386048,"rank":4329337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2257062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154803,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274337,"mean":11.53523102327,"rank":149366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":98372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274337,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1400,"mean":60.214610436026,"rank":1167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1400,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":93.862861788618,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Med Science Research","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=273304146441349&id=232581190513645","license":"public","citation_ids":[6712676],"posted_on":"2017-02-22T20:20:14+00:00","summary":"Gross.","author":{"name":"Question Everything Now","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/232581190513645","facebook_wall_name":"Question Everything Now","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/232581190513645\/picture","id_on_source":"232581190513645"}},{"title":"Notes from the Field: Injection Safety and Vaccine Administration Errors at an Employee Influenza Vaccination Clinic--New Jersey, 2015. -
