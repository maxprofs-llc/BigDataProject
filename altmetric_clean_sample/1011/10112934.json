Here the association between the genetic marker (GM) 3\/17 variants in the IgG1 heavy chain constant region, virus neutralization and NK-cell activation was investigated. In 100 HCMV-seropositive individuals the GM3\/17 polymorphism, serum 50% HCMV-AB neutralization (NT50) and in vitro HCMV-AB NK-cell activation was assessed. HCMV NT50 was higher in heterozygous GM3\/17 than in GM3\/3 persons (P=0.0276). Furthermore, individuals expressing GM3\/17 exhibited significantly higher NK-cell activation than persons carrying GM3\/3 (P<0.0001) or GM17\/17 (P=0.0095). Thus, persons expressing GM3\/17 have potentially a selective advantage in HCMV-defense.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Vietzen, Hannes","G\u00f6rzer, Irene","Puchhammer-St\u00f6ckl, Elisabeth"],"doi":"10.1093\/infdis\/jiw315","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T10:02:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1537-6613","0022-1899"],"journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1469803446,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27465644?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27465644?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27465644","pubdate":"2016-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"jiw315","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Association of Human IgG1 Heavy Chain Variants with Neutralization Capacity and Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity against HCMV","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-human-igg1-heavy-chain-variants-neutralization-capacity-antibody-dependent-cellular-cyto"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":4094386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3853247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257607,"mean":12.018571143529,"rank":129972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":117228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257607,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6815,"mean":6.5616008218374,"rank":5117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6815,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":11.856421875,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/statuses\/758965958245355521","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10112934],"posted_on":"2016-07-29T10:02:40+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":221},"tweet_id":"758965958245355521"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NKcellBiology\/statuses\/759036786622418945","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10112934],"posted_on":"2016-07-29T14:44:06+00:00","author":{"name":"NK cell Biology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/520597683086450689\/gybS02Uf_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #NKcell papers in #PubMed.
