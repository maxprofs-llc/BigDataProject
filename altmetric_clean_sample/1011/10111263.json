In a murine model, relamorelin decreased excitability of colonic circular smooth muscle cells and colonic intraluminal pressure.\nTo determine short-term effects of relamorelin on colonic motility measured by barostat and multilumen manometry in CC.\nIn a placebo-controlled, single-dose, double-blind, randomized study in patients with CC, we investigated the motor effects of relamorelin, 100\u00a0\u03bcg, SQ (12 patients) compared to placebo SQ (six patients). A motility-barostat balloon assembly was used to measure colonic compliance; tone and phasic pressure activity were measured before and after a 1000-kcal milkshake meal (administered ~60\u00a0min post-medication). Overall \"background\" phasic pressure activity was assessed by: average amplitude and motility index (MI\u00a0=\u00a0ln[sum amplitudes\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0#contractions\u00a0+\u00a01]) over defined periods. High-amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) were characterized by amplitude >75\u00a0mmHg and propagating contractions >50\u00a0mmHg; both were propagated over at least 10\u00a0cm. Postprandial HAPCs were the primary end point. The study sample had 80\u00a0% power to detect an increase of 3.3 HAPCs in the hour post-meal.\nRelamorelin, 100\u00a0\u03bcg, significantly induced more pre-meal propagated contractions [PCs of either >50 or >75\u00a0mmHg] compared to placebo (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Relamorelin also induced more post-meal PCs >50 or >75\u00a0mmHg than placebo. Relamorelin did not significantly alter colonic compliance, fasting or postprandial phasic pressure activity (20\u00a0min pre-meal fasting MI) or tone, and 60\u00a0min postprandial phasic pressure amplitude or MI, or tone.\nRelamorelin stimulates propagated colonic contractions without alteration of background irregular contractions in CC.
