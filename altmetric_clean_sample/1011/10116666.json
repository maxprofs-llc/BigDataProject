The authors calculated the percentages of patients with allergies, autoimmune diseases, asthma in both groups, and later statistical analysis were performed with two different chi-square tests.\nThe results obtained have shown that patients with endometriosis have a higher prevalence of allergies (p = 0.0003) and coexistence of both allergies and autoimmune diseases (p = 0.0274), compared to those without.\nThe present study seems to support the possible association between endometriosis and allergic diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d081","authors":["Caserta, D","Mallozzi, M","Pulcinelli, F M","Mossa, B","Moscarini, M"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T13:48:26+00:00","issns":["0390-6663"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinical and experimental obstetrics gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1469800091,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27328490?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27328490","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Endometriosis allergic or autoimmune disease: pathogenetic aspects--a case control study.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endometriosis-allergic-autoimmune-disease-pathogenetic-aspectsa-case-control-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":7061706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257608,"mean":12.018568160026,"rank":217687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257608,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":1.56984,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/statuses\/759022715344785408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10116666],"posted_on":"2016-07-29T13:48:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
