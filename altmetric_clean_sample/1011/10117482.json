The present experiments investigated the convergence of spinal and plantar pressure stimulation and voluntary effort in the activation of locomotor movements in uninjured subjects under full body weight support in a vertical position. For all conditions, leg movements were analyzed using electromyographic (EMG) recordings and optical motion capture of joint kinematics. Spinal cord stimulation elicited rhythmic hip and knee flexion movements accompanied by EMG bursting activity in the hamstrings of 6\/6 subjects. Similarly, plantar stimulation induced bursting EMG activity in the ankle flexor and extensor muscles in 5\/6 subjects. Moreover, the combination of spinal and plantar stimulation exhibited a synergistic effect in all 6 subjects, eliciting greater motor responses than either modality alone. While the motor responses to spinal verses plantar stimulation seems to activate distinct, but overlapping spinal neural networks, when engaged simultaneously, the stepping responses were functionally complementary. As observed during induced (involuntary) stepping, the most significant modulation of voluntary stepping occurred in response to the combination of spinal and plantar stimulation. In light of the known automaticity and plasticity of spinal networks in absence of supraspinal input, these findings support the hypothesis that spinal and plantar stimulation may be effective tools for enhancing the recovery of motor control in individuals with neurological injuries and disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e78","authors":["Yury Gerasimenko","Parag Gad","Dimitry Sayenko","Zach McKinney","Ruslan Gorodnichev","Aleksandr Puhov","Tatiana Moshonkina","Aleksandr Savochin","Victor Selionov","Tatiana Shigueva","Elena Tomilovskaya","Inessa Kozlovskaya","V.
