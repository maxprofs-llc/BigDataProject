Similarly, reprogramming differentiated cells requires both genetic program alterations and remodeling of the cellular architecture. While changes in genetic and epigenetic programs have been well documented in dedifferentiating cells, the pathways responsible for remodeling the cellular architecture and eliminating specialized protein complexes are not as well understood. Here, we utilize a zebrafish model of adult muscle regeneration to study cytoplasmic remodeling during cell dedifferentiation. We describe activation of autophagy early in the regenerative response to muscle injury, while blocking autophagy using chloroquine or Atg5 and Becn1 knockdown reduced the rate of regeneration with accumulation of sarcomeric and nuclear debris. We further identify Casp3\/caspase 3 as a candidate mediator of cellular reprogramming and Fgf signaling as an important activator of autophagy in dedifferentiating myocytes. We conclude that autophagy plays a critical role in cell reprogramming by regulating cytoplasmic remodeling, facilitating the transition to a less differentiated cell identity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006bbf","authors":["Saera-Vila, Alfonso","Kish, Phillip E","Louie, Ke'ale W","Grzegorski, Steven J","Klionsky, Daniel J","Kahana, Alon","Alfonso Saera-Vila"],"doi":"10.1080\/15548627.2016.1207015","endpage":"00","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T10:10:33+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nigms"],"issns":["1554-8635","1554-8627"],"issue":"10","journal":"Autophagy","last_mentioned_on":1477351811,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27467399?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27467399","https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/15548627.2016.1207015","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/15548627.2016.1207015","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/15548627.2016.1207015?hootPostID=b344f4e55d729794947e756f01d9ac21"],"pmid":"27467399","pubdate":"2016-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"00","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Autophagy Regulates Cytoplasmic Remodeling During Cell Reprogramming in a Zebrafish Model of Muscle Regeneration","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autophagy-regulates-cytoplasmic-remodeling-during-cell-reprogramming-zebrafish-model-muscle-regenera"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":4.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":1555560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6023498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252629,"mean":11.811268220466,"rank":69725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":182349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252629,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":951,"mean":3.8606989473684,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":951,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":4.2052,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
