The animals of group 1 served as control, while the animals of groups 2 and 3 were given (at 5\u00a0ml\/kg live weight) autoclaved and live culture of isolate TDGB 406 (10(6)\u00a0cells\/ml), respectively. The animals were fed with oak leaves as a basal roughage source and maize hay along with fixed quantity of concentrate mixture. After 4\u00a0months of feeding, the animals were slaughtered for carcass studies. The feeding of live culture of isolate TDGB 406 did not cause any effect (P\u2009>\u20090.05) on pre-slaughter weight, empty body weight, carcass weight, dressing percent, and yield of wholesale cuts (neck, rack, shoulder, breast, shank, loin, leg, and flank) of the goat meat. The chemical composition of longissimus dorsi muscle was comparable (P\u2009>\u20090.05) among the groups. The organoleptic evaluation of pressure-cooked meat in terms of tenderness and overall palatability was increased significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in the meat of group 3 where live culture was supplemented. The other attributes were similar among the groups. It was concluded that supplementation of tannin-degrading bacteria S. gallolyticus strain TDGB 406 to goats fed with oak leaves did not affect the carcass characteristics and meat quality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f610006766","authors":["Kumar, Kaushalendra","Chaudhary, L C","Agarwal, Neeta","Kamra, D N"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11250-016-1113-7","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T11:33:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-7438","0049-4747"],"journal":"Tropical Animal Health & Production","last_mentioned_on":1469791147,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27465694?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27465694","pubdate":"2016-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Veterinary Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Effect of feeding tannin-degrading bacteria Streptococcus gallolyticus strain TDGB 406 on meat quality of goats fed with Quercus semicarpifolia leaves","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-feeding-tannindegrading-bacteria-streptococcus-gallolyticus-strain-tdgb-406-meat-quality-goat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":7061748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257607,"mean":12.018716132388,"rank":217707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257607,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":484,"mean":2.3103436853002,"rank":341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":484,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.390625,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/goat_papers\/statuses\/758985200126668801","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10114374],"posted_on":"2016-07-29T11:19:07+00:00","author":{"name":"goatpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558367908275822592\/MZjFXuZV_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"goat_papers","tweeter_id":"2992530750","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":52},"tweet_id":"758985200126668801"}]}}
