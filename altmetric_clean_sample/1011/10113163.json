However, breast cancer patients have failed to benefit from proteasome inhibitor treatment partially due to proteasome heterogeneity, which is poorly understood in malignant breast neoplasm. Chemical crosslinking is an increasingly important tool for mapping protein three-dimensional structures and proteinprotein interactions. In the present study, two cross-linkers, bis (sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS(3)) and its water-insoluble analog disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), were used to map the subunit-subunit interactions in 20S proteasome core particle (CP) from MDA-MB-231 cells. Different types of gel electrophoresis technologies were used. In combination with chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, we applied these gel electrophoresis technologies to the study of the noncovalent interactions among 20S proteasome subunits. Firstly, the CP subunit isoforms were profiled. Subsequently, using native\/SDSPAGE, it was observed that 0.5 mmol\/L BS(3) was a relatively optimal cross-linking concentration for CP subunit-subunit interaction study. 2-DE analysis of the cross-linked CP revealed that \u03b11 might preinteract with \u03b12, and \u03b13 might pre-interact with \u03b14. Moreover, there were different subtypes of \u03b11\u03b12 and \u03b13\u03b14 due to proteasome heterogeneity. There was no significant difference in cross-linking pattern for CP subunits between BS(3) and DSS. Taken together, the gel-based characterization in combination with chemical cross-linking could serve as a tool for the study of subunit interactions within a multi-subunit protein complex. The heterogeneity of 20S proteasome subunit observed in breast cancer cells may provide some key information for proteasome inhibition strategy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6273cf058f610007cb9","authors":["Song, Hai","Xiong, Hua","Che, Jing","Xi, Qing-Song","Huang, Liu","Xiong, Hui-Hua","Zhang, Peng"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11596-016-1626-3","endpage":"570","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T10:11:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1672-0733","1993-1352"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Medical","last_mentioned_on":1469787014,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27465334?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27465334","pubdate":"2016-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"564","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Gel-based chemical cross-linking analysis of 20S proteasome subunit-subunit interactions in breast cancer","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gelbased-chemical-crosslinking-analysis-20s-proteasome-subunitsubunit-interactions-breast-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":7061856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257607,"mean":12.01884365271,"rank":217767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257607,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":1.0309917355372,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.79166666666667,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/758967865307336704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10113163],"posted_on":"2016-07-29T10:10:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"758967865307336704"}]}}
