These cells exhibit increased fatty acid synthesis and storage compared to normal breast cells or other tumor cells. Disruption of this synthetic process results in apoptosis. Since the addition of physiological doses of exogenous palmitate induces cell death in HER2\/neu-positive breast cancer cells, the pathway is likely operating at its limits in these cells. We have studied the response of HER2\/neu-positive breast cancer cells to physiological concentrations of exogenous palmitate to identify lipotoxicity-associated consequences of this physiology. Since epidemiological data show that a diet rich in saturated fatty acids is negatively associated with the development of HER2\/neu-positive cancer, this cellular physiology may be relevant to the etiology and treatment of the disease. We sought to identify signaling pathways that are regulated by physiological concentrations of exogenous palmitate specifically in HER2\/neu-positive breast cancer cells and gain insights into the molecular mechanism and its relevance to disease prevention and treatment.\nTranscriptional profiling was performed to assess programs that are regulated in HER2-normal MCF7 and HER2\/neu-positive SKBR3 breast cancer cells in response to exogenous palmitate. Computational analyses were used to define and predict functional relationships and identify networks that are differentially regulated in the two cell lines. These predictions were tested using reporter assays, fluorescence-based high content microscopy, flow cytometry and immunoblotting. Physiological effects were confirmed in HER2\/neu-positive BT474 and HCC1569 breast cancer cell lines.\nExogenous palmitate induces functionally distinct transcriptional programs in HER2\/neu-positive breast cancer cells. In the lipogenic HER2\/neu-positive SKBR3 cell line, palmitate induces a G2 phase cell cycle delay and CHOP-dependent apoptosis as well as a partial activation of the ER stress response network via XBP1 and ATF6. This response appears to be a general feature of HER2\/neu-positive breast cancer cells but not cells that overexpress only HER2\/neu. Exogenous palmitate reduces HER2 and HER3 protein levels without changes in phosphorylation and sensitizes HER2\/neu-positive breast cancer cells to treatment with the HER2-targeted therapy trastuzumab.\nSeveral studies have shown that HER2, FASN and fatty acid synthesis are functionally linked. Exogenous palmitate exerts its toxic effects in part through inducing ER stress, reducing HER2 expression and thereby sensitizing cells to trastuzumab. These data provide further evidence that HER2 signaling and fatty acid metabolism are highly integrated processes that may be important for disease development and progression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b0","authors":["Baumann, Jan","Wong, Jason","Sun, Yan","Conklin, Douglas S"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12885-016-2611-8","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T10:10:42+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1471-2407"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1469786970,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27464732?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4964104","pmid":"27464732","pubdate":"2016-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Palmitate-induced ER stress increases trastuzumab sensitivity in HER2\/neu-positive breast cancer cells","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/palmitateinduced-er-stress-increases-trastuzumab-sensitivity-her2neupositive-breast-cancer-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":7061867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257607,"mean":12.018847534607,"rank":217772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257607,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3456,"mean":3.544379739508,"rank":2804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3456,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242,"mean":5.6761742738589,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
