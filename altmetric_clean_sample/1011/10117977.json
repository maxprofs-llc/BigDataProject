All articles addressing SDM within goal-setting involving adult rehabilitation patients were included. The literature was critically appraised followed by a thematic synthesis.\nThe search output identified 3129 studies and 15 articles met the inclusion criteria. Themes that emerged related to methods of SDM within goal-setting, participants' views on SDM, perceived benefits of SDM, barriers and facilitators to using SDM and suggestions to improve involvement of patients resulting in a better process of goal-setting.\nThe literature showed various levels of patient involvement existing within goal-setting however few teams adopted an entirely patient-centred approach. However, since the review has identified clear value to consider SDM within goal-setting for rehabilitation, further research is required and practice should consider educating both clinicians and patients about this approach.\nTo enhance the use of SDM within goal-setting in rehabilitation it is likely clinicians and patients will require further education on this approach. For clinicians this could commence during their training at undergraduate level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032a1","authors":["Alice Rose","Sheeba Rosewilliam","Andrew Soundy","Rose, Alice","Rosewilliam, Sheeba","Soundy, Andrew"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pec.2016.07.030","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T15:04:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5134","07383991"],"journal":"Patient Education & Counseling","last_mentioned_on":1498944100,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/article\/S0738-3991(16)30325-1\/fulltext?rss%3Dyes%26utm_source%3Dtwitterfeed%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&rc=0&code=pec-site","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27486052?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0738399116303251?sf31958034%3D1%26cc%3Dy","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0738399116303251?sf31958034%253D1%2526cc%253Dy&rc=0&code=pec-site","http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/article\/S0738-3991(16)30325-1\/fulltext"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/article\/S0738399116303251\/pdf","pmid":"27486052","pubdate":"2016-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Shared decision making within goal setting in rehabilitation settings: A systematic review","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shared-decision-making-within-goal-setting-rehabilitation-settings-systematic-review-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":2018265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6394637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260677,"mean":12.061050821709,"rank":78509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":181245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260677,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1845,"mean":5.2842917570499,"rank":684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1845,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":5.1988148148148,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
