We performed a retrospective chart review and collected detailed information regarding the timing of the first 12-lead electrocardiogram, troponin order entry and first positive troponin result, administration of anticoagulation and antiplatelet medications, and referral for coronary angiography to identify areas of treatment variability and delay. A total of 242 patients with type 1 non-STEMI were included. The majority of patients received aspirin early after presentation to the emergency department; however, there was significant variability in the time from presentation to administration of other medications, including anticoagulation and P2Y12 therapy, even after an elevated troponin level was documented in the chart. Lack of a standardized non-STEMI admission order set, inconsistency regarding whether the emergency department physician or the cardiology admitting team order these medications after the diagnosis is made, and per current protocol, the initial call regarding the patient made to the cardiology fellow, not the admitting house staff, were identified as possible contributors to the delay. Patients who presented during \"nighttime\" hours had higher rates of atypical symptoms (P = 0.036) and longer delays to coronary angiography (46.5 versus 24 hours, P < 0.001) even in those deemed intermediate to high risk. A process analysis revealed considerable variation in non-STEMI treatment in our teaching hospital and identified specific areas for quality improvement measures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6133cf058f61000701d","authors":["Shepple, Benjamin I","Thistlethwaite, William A","Schumann, Christopher L","Akosah, Kwame O","Schutt, Robert C","Keeley, Ellen C","Shepple, Benjamin I.","Thistlethwaite, William A.","Schumann, Christopher L.","Akosah, Kwame O.","Schutt, Robert C.","Keeley, Ellen C."],"doi":"10.1097\/hpc.0000000000000083","endpage":"111","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T11:04:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-2811","1535-282X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Critical Pathways in Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1471317422,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27465006?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/critpathcardio\/Abstract\/2016\/09000\/Treatment_of_Non_ST_Elevation_Myocardial.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/critpathcardio\/2016\/09000\/Treatment_of_Non_ST_Elevation_Myocardial.8.pdf","pmid":"27465006","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"106","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Treatment of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/critpathcardio\/Fulltext\/2016\/09000\/Treatment_of_Non_ST_Elevation_Myocardial.8.aspx","volume":"15"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":5952730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1978462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258249,"mean":12.043072465227,"rank":167270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":75653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258249,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280,"mean":1.914,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.2954545454545,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/troponinpapers\/statuses\/758977413216739328","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10114002],"posted_on":"2016-07-29T10:48:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Troponin_papers","url":"http:\/\/www.highsteacs.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/658230994202468352\/J1L9QKml_normal.png","description":"Twitter-bot from @highSTEACS searches PubMed for latest #troponin #research","id_on_source":"troponinpapers","tweeter_id":"4038106461","geo":{"lt":55.95206,"ln":-3.19648,"country":"GB"},"followers":253},"tweet_id":"758977413216739328"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CPConlineJrl\/statuses\/765252828877066240","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10114002],"posted_on":"2016-08-15T18:24:26+00:00","author":{"name":"CriticalPathCardio","url":"http:\/\/critpathcardio.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611379103\/CPC_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Official Journal of the Society of Chest Pain Centers","id_on_source":"CPConlineJrl","tweeter_id":"400376171","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":9},"tweet_id":"765252828877066240"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CPConlineJrl\/statuses\/765386859610460160","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10114002],"posted_on":"2016-08-16T03:17:02+00:00","author":{"name":"CriticalPathCardio","url":"http:\/\/critpathcardio.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611379103\/CPC_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Official Journal of the Society of Chest Pain Centers","id_on_source":"CPConlineJrl","tweeter_id":"400376171","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":9},"tweet_id":"765386859610460160"}]}}
