In this model, all the conformationally relevant coarse-grained degrees of freedom are accounted for by sampling over the free energy surface of the atomic structures using quantum mechanics simulations. The interaction potential between non-bonded coarse-grained particles are optimized to accurately predict the experimentally measured density and glass transition temperature of the system. In addition, a new curing algorithm is also developed to model the creation of highly cross-linked epoxy networks. In this algorithm the reactants are evenly redistributed in the simulation cell to regions having a lower degree of cross-linking to avoid locking of reactive particles in regions having high degree of cross-linking. This new algorithm also dynamically controls the local degree of cross-linking to ensure uniformity of the resulting network. The curing simulation conducted using this algorithm is able to develop polymeric networks having a higher average degree of cross-linking, that is a more uniform throughout the simulation cell as compared to the networks cured using other curing algorithms. The predicted gel point from the current curing algorithm is in the acceptable theoretical and experimentally range of the measured values. Also, the resulting cross-linked microstructure shows a volume shrinkage of 5% that is close to experimentally measured volume shrinkage of the cured epoxy. Finally, the comparison of thermal expansion coefficient for the material in glassy and rubbery states shows a good agreement with experiment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Amin Aramoon"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpcb.6b03809","first_seen_on":"2016-08-11T12:08:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5207","1520-6106"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1472172245,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpcb.6b03809"],"pmid":"27504803","pubdate":"2016-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Study of the Curing and Properties of Highly Cross-Linked Epoxy Polymers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coarsegrained-molecular-dynamics-study-curing-properties-highly-crosslinked-epoxy-polymers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":5988950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1998641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258689,"mean":11.97041742949,"rank":167478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":75708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258689,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4028,"mean":1.7551288800596,"rank":1586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4028,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167,"mean":2.4165662650602,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"A Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Study of the Curing and Properties of Highly Cross-Linked Epoxy Polymers - The Journal of Physical Chemistry B (ACS Publications)","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1162622727142778&id=205028219568905","license":"public","citation_ids":[10400436],"posted_on":"2016-08-09T19:58:50+00:00","summary":"Current PhD student Amin Aramoon and Prof. El-Awady with two other co-authors from AFRL publish a new paper in The Journal of Physical Chemistry B titled:\n\n\"A Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Study of the Curing and Properties of Highly Cross-Linked Epoxy","author":{"name":"Computational & Experimental Materials Engineering Laboratory","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/205028219568905","facebook_wall_name":"Computational & Experimental Materials Engineering Laboratory","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/205028219568905\/picture","id_on_source":"205028219568905"}},{"title":"Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Study of the Curing\nand Properties of Highly Cross-Linked Epoxy Polymers","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=981397011986217&id=219195781539681","license":"public","citation_ids":[10400436,10400436],"posted_on":"2016-08-26T00:44:04+00:00","summary":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry BDOI: 10.1021\/acs.jpcb.6b03809","author":{"name":"National Society of Black Physicists","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/219195781539681","facebook_wall_name":"National Society of Black Physicists","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/219195781539681\/picture","id_on_source":"219195781539681"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlackPhysicists\/statuses\/768972212963389440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10400436],"posted_on":"2016-08-26T00:43:57+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16476},"tweet_id":"768972212963389440"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlackPhysicists\/statuses\/768972250041024513","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10400436],"posted_on":"2016-08-26T00:44:05+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16476},"tweet_id":"768972250041024513"}]}}
