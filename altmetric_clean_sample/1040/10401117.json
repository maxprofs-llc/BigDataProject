It has also greatly expanded once-limited treatment options and improved the ability to define posttreatment improvements, beyond clinical scores. The findings on the genomic\/transcriptomic level are also complemented by proteomic data, contributing to the understanding of the later changes taking place in the final stages of protein formation. Atopic dermatitis is defined as a Th2\/Th22 polarized disease with some contributions of Th17 and Th1 pathways. In atopic dermatitis, studies of biologics and small molecules, targeting specific pathways upregulated in atopic dermatitis, seem to provide well tolerated alternatives to conventional immunosuppressive therapies (i.e. corticosteroids and cyclosporine A), particularly for severe patients. Allergic contact dermatitis is defined as having Th1\/Th17-centered inflammation, especially with nickel-induced disease, but additional pathways, including Th2 and Th22, are upregulated with other allergens (i.e. fragrance).\nSupplementing studies of allergic skin diseases with '-omics' approaches are transforming the pathogenic understanding, diagnosis and, perhaps, also the treatment of these diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000585b","authors":["Oliva, Margeaux","Renert-Yuval, Yael","Guttman-Yassky, Emma","Margeaux Oliva","Yael Renert-Yuval","Emma Guttman-Yassky"],"doi":"10.1097\/aci.0000000000000306","endpage":"476","first_seen_on":"2016-08-11T12:43:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-6322","1528-4050"],"issue":"5","journal":"Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology","last_mentioned_on":1505644330,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27490125","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-allergy\/Abstract\/2016\/10000\/The__omics__revolution___redefining_the.10.aspx","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/ACI.0000000000000306","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27490125?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-allergy\/2016\/10000\/The__omics__revolution___redefining_the.10.pdf","pmid":"27490125","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The \u2018omics\u2019 revolution","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-allergy\/Fulltext\/2016\/10000\/The__omics__revolution___redefining_the.10.aspx","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/omics-revolution-redefining-understanding-treatment-allergic-skin-diseases-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":2164546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5111572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259841,"mean":12.009817202894,"rank":84073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":171611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259841,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":865,"mean":3.1860277777778,"rank":244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":865,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.7088235294118,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
