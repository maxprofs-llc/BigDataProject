In contrast, there is no difference between the genotypes in time spent in wakefulness or slow-wave sleep. (2) Systemic administration of the selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist LP-211 significantly increased wakefulness (time spent awake) and reduced rapid eye movement sleep in the rat. Direct infusion of LP-211 into the dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus nucleus, basal forebrain (horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca), or laterodorsal tegmental nucleus also produced a decrease in rapid eye movement sleep. Additionally, microinjection of the 5-HT7 receptor agonist into the basal forebrain augmented the time animals remained awake. Local injection of the 5-HT7 receptor agonist LP-44 into the dorsal raphe nucleus also suppressed rapid eye movement sleep in the rat. (3) A similar reduction of rapid eye movement sleep has been described following intraperitoneal injection of the selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonists SB-269970 and SB-656104 in the rat and oral administration of the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist NJ-18038683 to rat and man. Local microinjection of SB-269970 into the dorsal raphe nucleus and basal forebrain also induced a decrease in rapid eye movement sleep in the rat. This tends to suggest that the on-off (activation\/blockade), two-state ligand-receptor interaction model is not tenable for the 5-HT7 receptor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008783","authors":["Monti JM","Jantos H"],"doi":"10.1515\/revneuro-2014-0016","first_seen_on":"2014-09-26T12:12:39+00:00","issns":["0334-1763"],"issue":"","journal":"Reviews in the Neurosciences","last_mentioned_on":1411733471,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24681431?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24681431","pubdate":"2014-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The role of serotonin 5-HT7 receptor in regulating sleep and wakefulness.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-serotonin-5ht7-receptor-regulating-sleep-wakefulness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3571076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119884,"mean":8.1623003762003,"rank":88366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119884,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":2.3193382352941,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.3375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
