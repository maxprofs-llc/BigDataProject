We used electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EC-QCM-D) and cyclic voltammetry to compare the electrochemical swelling of two types of ferrocyanide containing polyelectrolyte multilayers, poly(L-glutamic acid)\/poly(allylamine)hydrochloride (PGA\/PAH) and carboxymethyl cellulose\/poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (CMC\/PDDA). We showed that ferrocyanide oxidation causes swelling of PGA\/PAH multilayers while it results in contraction of CMC\/PDDA multilayers. This behavior can be attributed to the presence of a positive and a negative Donnan potential in the case of PGA\/PAH and CMC\/PDDA multilayers respectively. Using multilayers consisting of PGA and poly(allylamine) ferrocene (PGA\/PAH-FC) we applied EC-QCM-D and demonstrated potentiostatic thickness control with nanometer precision and showed that the multilayer's thickness depends linearly on the applied potential within a certain potential range.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Raphael Zahn"],"doi":"10.1021\/la503051n","first_seen_on":"2014-09-26T09:16:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0743-7463"],"journal":"Langmuir","last_mentioned_on":1411722950,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/la503051n"],"pmid":"25229875","pubdate":"2014-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Tuning electrochemical swelling of polyelectrolyte multilayers towards nano-actuation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tuning-electrochemical-swelling-polyelectrolyte-multilayers-toward-nanoactuation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4745206,"mean":5.703640390671,"rank":3363751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":772111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4745206,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126422,"mean":8.6312019680276,"rank":86031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":25165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126422,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1938,"mean":2.6494713474445,"rank":1044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1938,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":1.9307543859649,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
