He was found to have a nonocclusive clot on his brachial vein and was treated with anticoagulants. This was his second lifetime thrombosis. A hematologic workup revealed no evidence of a hereditary origin, and thrombosis was believed to be related to recent exertion (baseball throwing). Upper extremity deep vein thromboses are extremely uncommon. However, because they can have potentially life-threatening consequences, deep vein thromboses must be on the differential for any athlete who presents with increased pain, swelling, or discoloration of an extremity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c2f","authors":["Sarah S Jackson","Micheal J O O'Brien"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-25T22:52:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0091-3847"],"issue":"2","journal":"Physician & Sportsmedicine","last_mentioned_on":1411685475,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25244713?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25244713","pubdate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Case report: upper extremity deep venous thrombosis in a 19-year-old baseball player.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-report-upper-extremity-deep-venous-thrombosis-19yearold-baseball-player"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8092097,"mean":6.8708560091147,"rank":6143641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1087969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8092097,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194783,"mean":7.8169270363793,"rank":127399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194783,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323,"mean":10.88252173913,"rank":262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":6.3715384615385,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SakamasPT\/status\/515272348308471809","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2715802],"posted_on":"2014-09-25T22:51:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Masayuki Saka","url":"http:\/\/questionthinkingpt.blogspot.jp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2502967389\/2dvz1yvcb0s9vcznz7ni_normal.jpeg","description":"Physical Therapist, PhD with special interest in throwing related shoulder & elbow injury\/ \u7406\u5b66\u7642\u6cd5\u58eb\u3001\u533b\u7642\u5de5\u5b66\u535a\u58eb\u3002\u91ce\u7403\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u80a9\u8098\u969c\u5bb3\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u63a2\u6c42\u4e2d\u3002","id_on_source":"SakamasPT","tweeter_id":"251676699","geo":{"lt":35.6895,"ln":139.69171,"country":"JP"},"followers":725},"tweet_id":"515272348308471809"}]}}
