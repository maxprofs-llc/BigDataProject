This infrastructure offering research design, expert review, trial management, research nurse, data support and dedicated facilities enables paediatricians to conduct more and better research. The challenge is how to design and conduct trials that will make a real difference to children's health. Standards for Research (StaR) in Child Health was founded in 2009 to address the paucity and shortcomings of paediatric clinical trials. This global initiative involves methodologists, clinicians, patient advocacy groups and policy makers dedicated to developing practical, evidence-based standards for enhancing the reliability and relevance of paediatric clinical research. In this overview, we highlight the contribution of StaR to this agenda, describe the international context, and suggest how StaR's future plans could be integrated with new and existing support for research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002302","authors":["William van't Hoff","Martin Offringa"],"doi":"10.1136\/archdischild-2012-303094","first_seen_on":"2014-09-26T17:06:51+00:00","issns":["14682044"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","last_mentioned_on":1421765624,"links":["http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2014\/09\/26\/archdischild-2012-303094.abstract","http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/100\/2\/189?etoc","http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/100\/2\/189?etoc="],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2014\/09\/26\/archdischild-2012-303094.full.pdf","pmid":"25260517","pubdate":"2014-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"archdischild-2012-303094","title":"StaR Child Health: developing evidence-based guidance for the design, conduct and reporting of paediatric trials","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/star-child-health-developing-evidencebased-guidance-design-conduct-reporting-paediatric-trials"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4758711,"mean":5.4938017449299,"rank":1824217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2906511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4758711,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122994,"mean":8.6379399152798,"rank":41398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":80607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122994,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2438,"mean":5.8036364382437,"rank":1172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2438,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":5.69,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
