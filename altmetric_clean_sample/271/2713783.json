This study aimed to identify the causative mutations in 21 Chinese families with HB and to analyse the association of these mutations with clinical phenotype. Phenotypic analyses were performed using one-stage assay for factor IX (FIX) activity (FIX: C) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for FIX antigen (FIX: Ag). Direct sequencing of the F9 gene was carried out. For those suspected to have a large deletion, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed. Predicting the causal impact of new changes was studied by bioinformatics approaches. We also assessed the effect of the F9 mutations on the FIX protein structure and function. Causative mutations were detected in all study patients. There were 14 point mutations, three small deletions, one large deletion and one small in-frame duplication that together comprised a total of 19 unique variants, of which five were novel. The structural and functional defects of novel missense and in-frame deletion\/duplication mutations were demonstrated by bioinformatics approaches. The 12 missense mutations include five purely quantitative mutations, five predominantly qualitative abnormalities and two combined defects. Our data confirmed the genetic heterogeneity of the F9 mutations. Quantitative missense mutations were found to be in different regions of precursor FIX compared with qualitative and combined ones.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029a1","authors":["Z-P Guo","L-H Yang","X-Y Qin","X-E Liu","J-F Chen","Y-F Zhang"],"doi":"10.1111\/hae.12534","first_seen_on":"2014-09-25T10:23:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2516"],"journal":"Haemophilia","last_mentioned_on":1411667592,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25251685?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25251685","pubdate":"2014-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Comprehensive analysis of phenotypes and genetics in 21 Chinese families with haemophilia B: characterization of five novel mutations.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comprehensive-analysis-phenotypes-genetics-21-chinese-families-haemophilia-b-characterization-five-n"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7906339,"mean":6.6913491995859,"rank":4118600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3760488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7906339,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194092,"mean":7.6700370960016,"rank":93511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":99650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194092,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":457,"mean":7.4874605263158,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":457,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.69285714285714,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3,"Mathematics":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/priyabangaram1\/status\/515197339619708928","license":"datasift","rt":["bioinfo_papers"],"citation_ids":[2713783],"posted_on":"2014-09-25T17:53:12+00:00","author":{"name":"priya bangaram","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/priya.bangaram1","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/727384306893619200\/YsoFIp1v_normal.jpg","description":"MOST BUSY GAL IN INDIA I'm a beautiful girl, Fitness Beauty Health Tips n Every interesting thing  priya.bangaram1 my facebook id :)","id_on_source":"priyabangaram1","tweeter_id":"507778236","geo":{"lt":20,"ln":77,"country":"IN"},"followers":2784},"tweet_id":"515197339619708928"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bioinfo_papers\/status\/515083971948847104","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2713783],"posted_on":"2014-09-25T10:22:43+00:00","author":{"name":"BioinfoPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/486168117215629312\/Ew1WC2aD_normal.png","id_on_source":"bioinfo_papers","tweeter_id":"2597874625","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":262},"tweet_id":"515083971948847104"}]}}
