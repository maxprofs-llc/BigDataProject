The authors report the arrest rates for murder, aggravated assault, other assault, and robbery among 192 male White House Case subjects 20-59 years old who were discharged from civil commitments in the early 1970s. These rates were compared with those for the same crimes in a random matched sample of arrested subjects and with the general population arrest rates. When rates were covaried for prior violent crime arrests, White House Case subjects with prior arrests had a significantly higher rate of total posthospitalization violent crime arrests than the matched control sample.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002216","authors":["D Shore","C R Filson","D S Rae"],"doi":"10.1176\/ajp.147.6.746","first_seen_on":"2014-09-25T22:29:09+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0002-953X"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1414187592,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2343918"],"pmid":"2343918","pubdate":"1990-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Violent crime arrest rates of White House Case subjects and matched control subjects.","type":"article","volume":"147","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/violent-crime-arrest-rates-white-house-case-subjects-matched-control-subjects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508925,"mean":5.2085143105191,"rank":255076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":4253270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508925,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119629,"mean":8.3706300197281,"rank":10666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":108933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119629,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3217,"mean":7.3059421641791,"rank":307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3217,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":18.246,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Omar Gonzalez, President Obama and Safety from Mentally Ill Assassins","url":"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/dj-jaffe\/omar-gonzalez-president-o_b_5868776.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[2715779],"posted_on":"2014-09-25T19:03:08+00:00","summary":"The recent scaling of the White House fence and entry into the front door of the White House by Omar Gonzalez should focus our attention on a bipartisan bill in Congress that attempts to get help to people with serious mental illness and might prevent even","author":{"name":"Huffington Post","url":"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/359\/normal\/image.png?1448021240"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MentalIllPolicy\/status\/525661685315805184","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2715779],"posted_on":"2014-10-24T14:54:46+00:00","author":{"name":"MentalIllnessPolicy","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MentalIllPolicy","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/853229834927046656\/fcXO663c_normal.jpg","description":"Policy info on serious #mentalIllness not #mentalhealth.
