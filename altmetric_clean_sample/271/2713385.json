This typically means that financing is based on people's ability to pay while, for service use, benefits are based on the need for health care. Financing incidence analysis (FIA) and benefit incidence analysis (BIA) are two popular tools used to assess equity in health systems financing and service use. FIA studies examine who pays for the health sector and how these contributions are distributed according to socioeconomic status (SES). BIA determines who benefits from health care spending, with recipients ranked by their relative SES. In this article, we identify 10 resources to assist researchers and policy makers seeking to undertake or interpret findings from financing and benefit incidence analyses in the health sector. The article pays particular attention to the data requirements, computations, methodological challenges and country level experiences with these types of analyses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5933cf058f610004f68","authors":["Virginia Wiseman","Augustine Asante","Jennifer Price","Andrew Hayen","Wayne Irava","Joao Martins","Lorna Guinness","Stephen Jan","Wiseman V","Asante A","Price J","Hayen A","Irava W","Martins J","Guinness L","Jan S"],"doi":"10.1093\/heapol\/czu108","endpage":"1058","first_seen_on":"2014-09-25T08:32:31+00:00","issns":["1460-2237","0268-1080"],"issue":"8","journal":"Health Policy & Planning","last_mentioned_on":1443404593,"links":["http:\/\/heapol.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/09\/24\/heapol.czu108.full","http:\/\/heapol.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/30\/8\/1053.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/heapol.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/09\/24\/heapol.czu108.full.pdf","pmid":"25255919","pubdate":"2014-09-23T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1053","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"title":"Ten best resources for conducting financing and benefit incidence analysis in resource-poor settings","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/heapol\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/heapol\/czu108","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ten-best-resources-conducting-financing-benefit-incidence-analysis-resourcepoor-settings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8312147,"mean":7.0046742294869,"rank":1767610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6533286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8312147,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195987,"mean":7.8666508730217,"rank":43580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":152056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195987,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1361,"mean":7.0158455882353,"rank":585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1361,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":10.739473684211,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
