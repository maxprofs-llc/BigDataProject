The final visual outcome and polyp eradication rate at 1 year were reported. A stepwise regression model was used to estimate the baseline clinical factors predictive of better visual outcome and polyp eradication.ResultsVisual acuities at 12-months follow-up improved significantly compared with baseline from 0.828 logMAR to 0.728 logMAR (P=0.026). The mean foveal thickness decreased from 380\u00b1175 to 278\u00b1117\u2009\u03bcm. In all 29.7% of eyes improved at least by 0.3 logMAR, and 55.4% remained stable in visual acuity with less than 0.3 logMAR change. Overall, 85% of eyes achieved at least stable vision, 20.2% (15\/74) cases achieved polyp eradication on angiogram, and 60.8% (45\/74) achieved polyp size reduction on angiogram at 1 year. Regarding predictive factors, the baseline visual acuity (P=0.003), no foveal involvement by abnormal choroidal vasculature (P<0.0001), absence of hard exudates (0.001) or subretinal fluid (<0.0001) are important clinical factors affecting the final visual outcome.ConclusionsCombination therapy with photodynamic therapy using Visudyne and three loading doses of intravitreal ranibizumab injections resulted in 85% success rate on visual stabilization and 81% success rate in polypoidal lesion control.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028a1","authors":["M Ho","E C F Lo","A L Young","D T L Liu"],"doi":"10.1038\/eye.2014.222","first_seen_on":"2014-09-26T13:36:04+00:00","issns":["0950-222X","1476-5454"],"journal":"Eye","last_mentioned_on":1411738513,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/eye.2014.222"],"pmid":"25257771","pubdate":"2014-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Outcomes research","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Outcome of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy at 1 year by combined therapy of photodynamic therapy with ranibizumab and predictive factors governing the outcome","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcome-polypoidal-choroidal-vasculopathy-1-year-combined-therapy-photodynamic-therapy-ranibizumab-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4299369,"mean":4.9892609938348,"rank":3402327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":124359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4299369,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115393,"mean":7.9864437396008,"rank":90603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115393,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":810,"mean":1.7266328800989,"rank":487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":810,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":1.7394230769231,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
