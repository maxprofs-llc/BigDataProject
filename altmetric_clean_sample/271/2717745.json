In C. elegans, the PIWI type Argonaute, PRG-1, through an association with 21U-RNAs, mediates a genome surveillance process by constantly scanning the genome for potentially deleterious invading elements. Upon recognition of foreign nucleic acids, PRG-1 initiates a cascade of cytoplasmic and nuclear events that results in heritable epigenetic silencing of these transcripts and their coding genomic loci. If the PRG-1\/21U-RNA genome surveillance pathway has the capacity to target most of the C. elegans transcriptome, what mechanisms exist to protect endogenous transcripts from being silenced by this pathway? In this commentary, we discuss three recent publications that implicate the CSR-1 small RNA pathway in the heritable activation of germline transcripts, propose a model as to why not all epialleles behave similarly, and touch on the practical implications of these findings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"536246132a83ee225b8b4590","authors":["Christopher J Wedeles","Monica Z Wu","Julie M Claycomb"],"doi":"10.4161\/worm.28641","first_seen_on":"2014-09-26T11:46:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2162-4046"],"journal":"Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control, with Measurement + Control","last_mentioned_on":1438776940,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25254148?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/worm.28641?hootPostID=38841f7e11081f8ab1adc062ad82206f&","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/worm.28641?hootPostID=6f395806c8846d925d3552bac6aabe83#abstract"],"pmid":"25254148","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Silent no more","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/silent-more-endogenous-small-rna-pathways-promote-gene-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446280,"mean":6.3424578120231,"rank":2893907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1850382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446280,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145725,"mean":8.6393695616372,"rank":74737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":54532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145725,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":1.5301979695431,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.05,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
