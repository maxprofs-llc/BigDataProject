While individual A\u03b2-accumulation can be measured non-invasively using Pittsburgh Compund-B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET), Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequence, capable of indicating heterogeneous age-related brain pathologies associated with tissue-edema. In the current study cognitively normal elderly subjects were investigated for regional correlation of PiB- and FLAIR intensity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc08","authors":["Simon J Schreiner","Xinyang Liu","Anton F Gietl","Michael Wyss","Stefanie C Steininger","Esmeralda Gruber","Valerie Treyer","Irene B Meier","Andrea M K\u00e4lin","Sandra E Leh","Alfred Buck","Roger M Nitsch","Klaas P Pruessmann","Christoph Hock","Paul G Unschuld"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnagi.2014.00240","first_seen_on":"2014-09-25T11:54:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1663-4365"],"journal":"Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1411646026,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25249977?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25249977","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Regional Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) at 7 Tesla correlates with amyloid beta in hippocampus and brainstem of cognitively normal elderly subjects.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regional-fluidattenuated-inversion-recovery-flair-7-tesla-correlates-amyloid-beta-hippocampus-brains"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4296759,"mean":4.9956376126593,"rank":2383323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1161867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4296759,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115073,"mean":7.954286551029,"rank":62550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":32859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115073,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":497,"mean":6.0578387096774,"rank":332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":497,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":6.57816,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
