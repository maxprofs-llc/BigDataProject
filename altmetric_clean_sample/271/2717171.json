This led to the evaluation of safety measures with regard to dioxin intake from food. Important aspects regarding dioxins and PCBs in the food chain are reviewed here, allowing a contextual understanding of the present situation through its chronological developments. About 90-98% of the average exposure of humans to dioxins and PCBs results from dietary intake, with food of animal origin being the predominant source. Therefore, animal feed contributes considerably to the presence of these compounds in food. The detection of the \"real\" source of a contamination event in the food chain is a complex scientific problem and requires specific knowledge on production processes and changes of patterns during bioaccumulation. This is demonstrated by complex investigations performed in three studies on two continents to identify the source (e.g. from contamination of cow's milk in Germany, to citrus pulp pellets from Brazil as an ingredient in feed, then to contaminated lime for neutralization and finally to a landfill with residues of vinyl chloride monomer production). This example shows also the substantial economic losses resulting from incidents in the food chain and the consequences to global trade. In 2001, the EU Scientific Committee on Food established a group tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 14 pg WHO-TEQ\/kg body weight and concluded that a considerable proportion of the European population would exceed this TWI. On the global level, the Joint FAO\/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) provides scientific advice to the Codex Alimentarius Commission and therefore contributes to harmonized international food standards. In its evaluation of 2001, JECFA derived a provisional tolerable monthly intake (PTMI) of 70 pg TEQ\/kg body weight. The sum of the median intake of PCDD\/F-TEQ and PCB-TEQ exceeded the PTMI in Western European countries, was in the PTMI range in North America, but lower in Japan and New Zealand. The 90th percentile of PCDD\/F-TEQ exceeded the PTMI in Western European countries and North America, the 90th percentile of coplanar PCBs in Western European countries. Therefore, in 2001 the EU Commission developed a strategy to reduce the presence of dioxins and PCBs in the environment and in the food chain. The legislative measures comprised maximum levels and action levels for feed and food, and a Rapid Alert System for detected incidents was introduced. The network of the EU Reference Laboratory and National Reference Laboratories contributes to harmonization within the EU Member States and developed analytical criteria for screening and confirmatory methods for control of feed and food. After all these efforts it is of general interest to see whether these measures had an effect. The 2012 evaluation of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) based on comprehensive monitoring data of 26 European countries shows a general decrease in dietary exposure of dioxins and DL-PCBs between 2002-2004 and 2008-2010, estimated to be between 16.6% and 79.3% for the different population groups. A smaller decrease was observed for NDL-PCBs. The percentage of individuals exposed above the TWI of 14 pg TEQ\/kg b.w. was estimated to be between 1.0 and 52.9%. Toddlers and other children were the most exposed groups (being at the upper end of these ranges). Fish, meat and dairy products appeared to be the highest contributing food groups to dietary exposure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Malisch R","Kotz A","Rainer Malisch","Alexander Kotz"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2014.03.022","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2014-09-26T09:43:03+00:00","issns":["00489697","0048-9697"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1479239472,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0048969714003520","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24804623","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2014.03.022"],"pmid":"24804623","pubdate":"2014-05-03T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2","title":"Dioxins and PCBs in feed and food \u2014 Review from European perspective ","type":"article","volume":"491-492","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dioxins-pcbs-feed-food-review-european-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.35,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8118867,"mean":6.8857031127181,"rank":1479692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6634924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8118867,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195185,"mean":7.8692798794985,"rank":38017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":156975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195185,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5131,"mean":4.9959001949318,"rank":974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":4161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5131,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":3.8277692307692,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Ph.
