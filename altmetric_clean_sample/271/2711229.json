Aims of the present study were to learn more about the pathogenic mechanisms of this syndrome and to evaluate benefits of food supplements on these disorders. In in vitro assay, Lactobacillus acidophilus lysate inhibited interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 generation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages in dose- and size-dependent manner. For a prospective, open-label phase I\/II controlled clinical trial, 40 subjects affected by ocular dysesthesia and hyperesthesia and comorbid enteral and anxiety-depression symptoms were randomly assigned either into the treated group, which received a composition containing probiotic lysate, vitamins A, B, and D and omega 3 fatty acids, or into the control group, which received vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids. For reference, 20 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were also selected. White blood count (WBC) and lymphocyte and monocyte counts, as well as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels, were significantly above the reference levels in both treated and control groups. After 8 weeks, WBC and lymphocyte and monocyte counts, and cytokine levels significantly decreased, and ocular, enteral, and anxiety-depression symptoms significantly improved in the treated group as compared to the control group. This proof-of-concept study suggested that subclinical inflammation may be a common mechanism connecting ocular, enteral, and anxiety\/depression symptoms, and supplements affecting dysbiosis may be a new approach to treating this syndrome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f610008361","authors":["Janos Feher","Erika Pinter","Ill\u00e9s Kov\u00e1cs","Zsuzsanna Helyes","Agnes Kem\u00e9ny","Adrienn Markovics","Rocco Plateroti","Aloisa Librando","Filippo Cruciani","Feher J","Pinter E","Kov\u00e1cs I","Helyes Z","Kem\u00e9ny A","Markovics A","Plateroti R","Librando A","Cruciani F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jtos.2013.09.002","endpage":"145","first_seen_on":"2014-09-24T15:43:32+00:00","issns":["1542-0124","1937-5913","15420124"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Ocular Surface","last_mentioned_on":1480369090,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1542012413001663","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24725325\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24725325","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theocularsurfacejournal.com%2Farticle%2FS1542-0124%2813%2900166-3%2Fpdf&code=jtos-site","http:\/\/www.theocularsurfacejournal.com\/article\/S1542-0124(13)00166-3\/pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.theocularsurfacejournal.com\/article\/S1542012413001663\/pdf","pmid":"24725325","pubdate":"2014-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"134","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Irritable eye syndrome: neuroimmune mechanisms and benefits of selected nutrients.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/irritable-eye-syndrome-neuroimmune-mechanisms-benefits-selected-nutrients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":1774246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6010868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191733,"mean":7.7178092232911,"rank":47181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":143601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191733,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":8.9391898734177,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Postgraduate":4,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":8,"Professor":3},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":15,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":5,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Mathematics":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1,"CI":1,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"PE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/omfito\/status\/514802119661334528","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2711229],"posted_on":"2014-09-24T15:42:44+00:00","author":{"name":"omar campos","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/745260918716534785\/yiGufnfm_normal.jpg","description":"Medicina Interna..
