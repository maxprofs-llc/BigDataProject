It has become the standard of care in many parts of the world, but practice is variable, and there has been a lack of standardized training and evaluation to date. Targeted neonatal echocardiography was first introduced to Canada in 2006. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of targeted neonatal echocardiography practice and training methods in Canadian neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f0e","authors":["Emer Finan","Arvind Sehgal","Afif El Khuffash","Patrick J.
