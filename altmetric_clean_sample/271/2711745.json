The device creates a dynamic trap by operating in feedback; a cell is periodically redirected back and forth through a microfluidic volume sensor (Coulter principle). Sieve valves are positioned on both ends of the sensing channel, creating a physical barrier which enables media to be quickly exchanged while keeping a cell firmly in place. The volume of individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells was tracked over entire growth cycles, and the ability to quickly exchange media was demonstrated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f6100039c3","authors":["Jason Riordon","Jason Riordon","Michael Nash","Wenyang Jing","Michel Godin"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4867035","first_seen_on":"2014-09-24T19:02:49+00:00","issns":["1932-1058"],"journal":"Biomicrofluidics","last_mentioned_on":1411585254,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/bmf\/8\/1\/10.1063\/1.4867035?track=tweet"],"pmid":"24753720","pubdate":"2014-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Interdisciplinary Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Classical Physics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Quantifying the volume of single cells continuously using a microfluidic pressure-driven trap with media exchange","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantifying-volume-single-cells-continuously-using-microfluidic-pressuredriven-trap-media-exchange"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4292858,"mean":5.0025835011942,"rank":3400592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":124235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4292858,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114862,"mean":7.9980004527212,"rank":90499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114862,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288,"mean":2.8700975609756,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":5.6660714285714,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
