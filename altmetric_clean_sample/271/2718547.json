Adults aged 45-59\u00a0years from four UK general practices were randomly assigned to receive standard information ('The Facts', n\u00a0=\u00a02,216) versus standard information plus 'The Gist' leaflet (Gist\u00a0+\u00a0Facts, n\u00a0=\u00a02,236). Questionnaires were returned by 964\/4,452 individuals (22\u00a0%). 82\u00a0% of respondents reported having read the information, but those with poor numeracy were less likely (74 vs. 88\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The 'Gist\u00a0+\u00a0Facts' group were more likely to reach the criterion for adequate knowledge (95 vs. 91\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a0.01), but this was not moderated by numeracy. Most respondents (98\u00a0%) intended to participate in screening, with no group differences and no interaction with numeracy. The improved levels of knowledge and self-reported reading suggest 'The Gist' leaflet may increase engagement with colorectal cancer screening, but ceiling effects reduced the likelihood that screening intentions would be affected.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc0","authors":["Samuel G.
