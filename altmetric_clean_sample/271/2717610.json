They exhibit blue light emission, with extremely high photoluminescence quantum yields approaching 100% in the crystals. Emission lifetime analyses and density functional theory calculations revealed that the bright blue light emission at room temperature is mainly delayed fluorescence originating from the singlet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) state combined with the halide-to-ligand charge transfer (XLCT) state, ((1)(M + X)LCT), while that at 77 K is phosphorescence from the (3)(M + X)LCT transition state, due to the small singlet-triplet energy differences (\u0394E = 940-1170 cm(-1)). The ternary ligand systems consisting of halide, bulky phosphine, and N-heteroaromatic ligands constitute inexpensive pure-blue-light-emitting materials, which can be fabricated by facile procedures such as simple manual grinding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Masako Kato","Hiroki Ohara","Atsushi Kobayashi"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4dt02709d","endpage":"17323","first_seen_on":"2014-09-26T11:07:36+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"46","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1411729491,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2014\/DT\/C4DT02709D"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2014\/dt\/c4dt02709d","pmid":"25315634","pubdate":"2014-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"17317","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Simple and Extremely Efficient Blue Emitters Based on Mononuclear Cu(I)-Halide Complexes with Delayed Fluorescence","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simple-extremely-efficient-blue-emitters-based-mononuclear-cu-scpiscp-halide-complexes-delayed-fluor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3579158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119885,"mean":8.3016906009146,"rank":92112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119885,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992,"mean":0.69031810787136,"rank":2668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.7,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
