Guidance compliance continues to be a concern. Junior doctors are the main group responsible for prescribing thromboprophylaxis. We aimed to compare local pharmacological thromboprophylaxis prescribing against NICE guidelines in a surgical department at a district general hospital, and determine whether interventions aimed at improving compliance were effective.\nOver four months, a two cycle audit of prescribing patterns for VTE prophylaxis was performed using data collected at four intervals: 1. Baseline 2. Following pro-forma introduction and feedback 3. A second baseline data collection. 4. Following VTE prophylaxis teaching.\nA total of 394 admissions were included. Correct identification and prescribing for at-risk patients ranged between 76 and 93\u00a0%, whilst risk assessment documentation and explanation to patients occurred in fewer than 50 and 66\u00a0% respectively. Prescribing and risk assessment improved in the first cycle (chi2\u2009=\u20096.75, p\u2009=\u20090.009 and chi2\u2009=\u200910.70, p\u2009=\u20090.001 respectively), a consequence of one specialty improving following additional feedback. Teaching was not associated with improvements. Overall compliance with NICE guidelines was achieved in no more than 25\u00a0% of admissions.\nDespite junior doctors generally prescribing VTE thromboprophylaxis appropriately, overall compliance with guidelines remained poor regardless of educational interventions. Verbal feedback was the only intervention associated with modest improvements. A pressurised work environment may limit the impact of educational interventions. Guidance simplification or devolving responsibility to other members of staff may improve compliance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bb","authors":["Bethany J. Watt","Dean T.
