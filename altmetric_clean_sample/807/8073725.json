The Parent Satisfaction Survey at a 250-bed children's hospital was revised based on what parents thought was most important for a nurse to do for themselves and their children. This report is based on a retrospective review of 1,405 self-reported parent surveys collected as a performance improvement activity over a 12-month time period. Surveys were distributed to parents of hospitalized children and were returned anonymously to mailboxes on the units. Using content analysis, a group of pediatric nurses reviewed the parents' comments to determine major themes. The themes were caring, communication, safety, environment, and appreciation. The parent survey was revised to include the themes parents identified as important.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a86","authors":["Patricia Schaffer","Gretchen Vaughn","Carole Kenner","Florence Donohue","Anne Longo"],"doi":"10.1053\/jpdn.2000.16713","endpage":"377","first_seen_on":"2016-05-21T06:44:35+00:00","issns":["0882-5963","1532-8449"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1463725513,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1053\/jpdn.2000.16713"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricnursing.org\/article\/S0882596300750408\/pdf","pmid":"11151475","pubdate":"2000-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"373","subjects":["nursing","pediatrics"],"title":"Revision of a parent satisfaction survey based on the parent perspective","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/revision-parent-satisfaction-survey-based-parent-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7722452,"mean":6.6241115612059,"rank":1067009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6586179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7722452,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268754,"mean":11.474944368993,"rank":53734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":211441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268754,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":411,"mean":3.054287804878,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":411,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":8.8166666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
