The circumstances in which a role for active drug metabolites may be suspected are described, and a number of specific examples are given. Four different categories are described: drugs which are inactive precursors of active metabolites (e.g. DOPA and cyclophosphamide); active metabolites which contribute to the duration of action of the parent compound (e.g. hexamethylmelamine and clobazam); active metabolites showing a mechanism of action different from that of the parent compound (e.g. buspirone and 1-pyrimidinyl piperazine; fenfluramine and norfenfluramine); and active metabolites showing an antagonistic effect on the activity of the parent drug (e.g. trazodone and m-chlorophenyl-piperazine; aspirin and salicylate).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002571","authors":["Silvio Garattini"],"doi":"10.2165\/00003088-198510030-00002","first_seen_on":"2017-06-04T03:09:56+00:00","issns":["0312-5963","1179-1926"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinical Pharmacokinetics","last_mentioned_on":1496545861,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2861928"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.2165%2F00003088-198510030-00002.pdf","pmid":"2861928","pubdate":"1985-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Active Drug Metabolites","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/active-drug-metabolites"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":2126720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5056087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241699,"mean":12.203968340656,"rank":79994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":159259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241699,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":673,"mean":3.9283005952381,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":673,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":4.92,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Trazodone","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=783707540#altmetric_citation_273beb23-dc2b-4985-827f-7b6446afc2ab","license":"public","citation_ids":[20806271,20806271],"posted_on":"2017-06-04T03:09:51+00:00","summary":"Trazodone (sold under the brand name Oleptro, among many others) is an antidepressant of the serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) class.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=2326240","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Jytdog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Jytdog"}},{"title":"Etoperidone","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=783707663#altmetric_citation_8fec2c85-9276-47e8-b927-e98aaac0022d","license":"public","citation_ids":[20806271,20806271],"posted_on":"2017-06-04T03:11:01+00:00","summary":"Etoperidone (Axiomin, Centren, Depracer, Etonin, Etoran, Staff, Tropene), also known as clopradone and triazolinone, is an antidepressant of the phenylpiperazine class which was introduced in Europe in 1977.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=5796971","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Jytdog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Jytdog"}}]}}
