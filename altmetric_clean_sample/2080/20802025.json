The evolution of the parameters (contact angle, diameter, and volume) during evaporation measured using a drop shape analyzer and the infrared thermal mapping of the drop surface recorded by an infrared camera were used in investigating the evaporation process. The pure 1-butanol drop does not show any thermal instability at different substrate temperatures, while the convection cells created by the thermal Marangoni effect appear on the surface of the pure water drop from 50\u00b0C. Because 1-butanol and water have different surface tensions, the infrared video of the 5% 1-butanol aqueous solution drop shows that the convection cells are generated by the solutal Marangoni effect at any substrate temperature. Furthermore, when the substrate temperature exceeds 50\u00b0C, co-existence of the thermal and solutal Marangoni flows is observed. By analyzing the relation between the ratio of the evaporation rate of pure water and 1-butanol aqueous solution drops and the Marangoni number, a series of empirical equations for predicting the evaporation rates of pure water and 1-butanol aqueous solution drops at the initial time as well as the equations for the evaporation rate of 1-butanol aqueous solution drop before the depletion of alcohol are derived. The results of these equations correspond fairly well to the experimental data.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Pin Chen","Souad Harmand","Safouene Ouenzerfi","Jesse Schiffler"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpcb.7b02766","first_seen_on":"2017-06-03T23:58:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6106","1520-5207"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1496534271,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpcb.7b02766"],"pmid":"28535066","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Marangoni Flow Induced Evaporation Enhancement on Binary Sessile Drops","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/marangoni-flow-induced-evaporation-enhancement-binary-sessile-drops"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":7188649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241990,"mean":12.178410721148,"rank":197013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241990,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4046,"mean":1.7512,"rank":2612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4046,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":1.6436363636364,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
