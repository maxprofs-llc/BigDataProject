Dynamic treatment-couch tracking of the moving tumor is a promising new MMT and was compared to the internal-target-volume (ITV) concept, the mid-ventilation (MidV) principle and the gating approach in a planning study based on 4D dose calculations.\nFor twenty patients with lung lesions, planning target volumes (PTV) were adapted to the MMT and stereotactic body radiotherapy treatments were prepared with the 65%-isodose enclosing the PTV. For tracking, three concepts for target volume definition were considered: Including the gross tumor volume of one phase (single-phase tracking), including deformations between phases (multi-phase tracking) and additionally including tracking latencies of a couch tracking system (reliable couch tracking). The accumulated tumor and lung doses were estimated with 4D dose calculations based on 4D-CT datasets and deformable image registration.\nSingle-phase tracking showed the lowest ipsilateral lung Dmean (median: 3.3Gy), followed by multi-phase tracking, gating, reliable couch tracking, MidV and ITV concepts (3.6, 3.8, 4.1, 4.3 and 4.8Gy). The 4D dose calculations showed the MidV and single-phase tracking overestimated the target mean dose (-2.3% and -1.3%), while it was slightly underestimated by the other MMT (<+1%).\nThe ITV concept ensures tumor coverage, but exposes the lung tissue to a higher dose. The MidV, gating and tracking concepts were shown to reduce the lung dose. Neglecting non-translational changes of the tumor in the target volume definition for tracking results in a slightly reduced target coverage. The slightly inferior dose coverage for MidV should be considered when applying this technique clinically.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003423","authors":["Ehrbar, Stefanie","J\u00f6hl, Alexander","Tartas, Adrianna","Stark, Luisa Sabrina","Riesterer, Oliver","Kl\u00f6ck, Stephan","Guckenberger, Matthias","Tanadini-Lang, Stephanie","Stefanie Ehrbar","Alexander J\u00f6hl","Adrianna Tartas","Luisa Sabrina Stark","Oliver Riesterer","Stephan Kl\u00f6ck","Matthias Guckenberger","Stephanie Tanadini-Lang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.radonc.2017.05.016","first_seen_on":"2017-06-04T05:13:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0167-8140","01678140","1879-0887"],"journal":"Radiotherapy & Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1496980678,"links":["http:\/\/www.thegreenjournal.com\/article\/S0167-8140(17)30380-8\/fulltext?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.radonc.2017.05.016","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0167814017303808&_version=1&md5=841ffc8faa4624321c9c733e5e2931e3"],"pmid":"28587761","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"ITV, mid-ventilation, gating or couch tracking \u2013 A comparison of respiratory motion-management techniques based on 4D dose calculations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/itv-midventilation-gating-couch-tracking-comparison-respiratory-motionmanagement-techniques-based-4d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":3921366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4387796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242961,"mean":12.501575288113,"rank":111206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":129940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242961,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2150,"mean":2.2367687296417,"rank":566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2150,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":4.3771844660194,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
