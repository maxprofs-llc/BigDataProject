Rapid European integration and other political developments require valid and reliable international overviews, sound studies and profound analyses of this controversial issue.\nTo give an overview of compulsory admission data from official sources across the European Union (EU).\nData on the legal frameworks for involuntary placement or treatment of people with mental illness and their outcomes were provided and assessed by experts from all EU member states.\nTotal frequencies of admission and compulsory admission rates vary remarkably across the EU. Variation hints at the influence of differences in legal frameworks or procedures. Time series suggest an overall tendency towards more or less stable quotas in most member states.\nFurther research is greatly needed in this field. Common international health reporting standards are essential to the compilation of basic data.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057a0","authors":["Hans Joachim Salize","Harald Dressing"],"doi":"10.1192\/bjp.184.2.163","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T09:04:11+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0007-1250","1472-1465"],"journal":"British Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1167609600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1192\/bjp.184.2.163"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjp.rcpsych.org\/content\/bjprcpsych\/184\/2\/163.full.pdf","pmid":"14754830","pubdate":"2004-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal College of Psychiatrists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Epidemiology of involuntary placement of mentally ill people across the European Union","type":"article","volume":"184","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemiology-involuntary-placement-mentally-ill-people-across-european-union"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8106765,"mean":6.8893720095886,"rank":2045974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4954238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8106765,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96837,"mean":10.91714337643,"rank":30007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":65824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96837,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4304,"mean":10.838561468743,"rank":2028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4304,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":18.976518518519,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
