The equivalent prevalences for depressive disorders were 2.4% and 6.0%, respectively, and those for anxiety states were 3.5% and 3.7%. Only a quarter of needs for treatment were met, with the situation being better for depression than for anxiety.\nThe rates of psychiatric disorder in Derry were even higher than those reported by a similar survey in inner London. This almost certainly reflects the very high levels of social deprivation in the District. Needs for treatment were often unmet.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057a0","authors":["PAMELA McCONNELL","PAUL BEBBINGTON","ROY McCLELLAND","KATE GILLESPIE","SHARON HOUGHTON"],"doi":"10.1192\/bjp.181.3.214","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T09:06:10+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["00071250","1472-1465","0007-1250"],"journal":"British Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1167609600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1192\/bjp.181.3.214"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjp.rcpsych.org\/content\/bjprcpsych\/181\/3\/214.full.pdf","pmid":"12204925","pubdate":"2002-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal College of Psychiatrists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Prevalence of psychiatric disorder and the need for psychiatric care in Northern Ireland: Population study in the District of Derry","type":"article","volume":"181","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-psychiatric-disorder-need-psychiatric-care-northern-ireland-population-study-district-der-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8106765,"mean":6.8893720095886,"rank":2045993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4954235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8106765,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96837,"mean":10.91714337643,"rank":30007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":65824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96837,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4304,"mean":10.838561468743,"rank":2030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4304,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":18.976518518519,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
