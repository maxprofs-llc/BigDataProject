Male Muta Mice were injected intraperitoneally with MMS at a dose of 80 mg\/kg, a potent dominant lethal dose. Animals were killed on days 3 and 7 (Experiment 1) or days 10 and 14 (Experiment 2) after the treatment. Mutant frequencies (MFs) in the testis, sperm and spleen (Experiment 2 only) were analyzed by the positive selection system using E. coli C (GalE-) strain and phenyl beta-D-galactoside. The spontaneous MFs in the testis and sperm were 2.0-3.1 x 10(-5). No induction of mutation in the testis or sperm of the MMS-treated groups was observed at any sampling point. In the spleen, the spontaneous MF was approximately twice as high as that in the germ cells although the MF at each sampling point was almost the same as the spontaneous MF. MMS is known as a potent clastogen from the results of the dominant lethal assay and the micronucleus assay. The reason for the discrepancy between the results of these assays and the present results may have been insensitivity of the in vitro packaging to large deletion due to the failure to rescue the large deleted gene. It is suggested that the transgenic mouse assay using the in vitro packaging can not replace the dominant lethal assay in the case of MMS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f61000313a","authors":["Satoru Itoh","Miki Miura","Hiroyasu
