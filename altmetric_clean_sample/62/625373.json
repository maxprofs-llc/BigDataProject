The definition of onset of action must embrace both the degree of symptom reduction and the duration of reduction over time. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of the definition is the classification of subjects with symptom reduction that is not sustained. The scheduling of assessments in such a trial is critical. Unlike standard RCTs for mood or anxiety disorders, weekly or biweekly assessments could prove to be insensitive to group differences. The data analytic procedure must focus on change over time in order to detect differential onset, yet account for problems of multiplicity and attrition. Repeated statistical tests at each successive assessment time might appear to be intuitively appealing, but they require multiplicity adjustments. The data analytic approach must also be flexible enough to incorporate available data from subjects who fail to complete some assessments. The applicability of mixed-effects models and the cure model to challenges in the study of onset of action is described.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008671","authors":["Leon AC"],"first_seen_on":"2012-02-28T17:23:02+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Psychopharmacology Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1330448810,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19629021?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"19629021","pubdate":"2009-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology"],"title":"Statistical strategies for randomized controlled clinical trials to detect differential onset of action.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/statistical-strategies-randomized-controlled-clinical-trials-detect-differential-onset-action"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":2904846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75155,"mean":4.0499502355164,"rank":54049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75155,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":2.7457846153846,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AnxietyNews\/status\/174541078991605760","citation_ids":[625373],"posted_on":"2012-02-28T17:06:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Social Anxiety Help","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/anxietynews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1133209691\/Anxiety-News-Logo_normal.jpg","description":"Latest News, Treatment, Helpful Information For Those Of Us Battling Social Anxiety, GAD, Depression TOGETHER WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER, TOGETHER WE CAN GIVE HOPE!","id_on_source":"AnxietyNews","tweeter_id":"195630483","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":3318},"tweet_id":"174541078991605760"}]}}
