A key to the discovery was the rational exploration of the initial HTS hit 13 guided by an overlay model built with reported mGlu2 receptor PAM chemotypes. The initial weak in vitro activity of the hit 13 was quickly improved, although compounds still had suboptimal druglike properties. Subsequent modulation of the physicochemical properties resulted in compounds having a more balanced profile, combining good potency and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. Final refinement by addressing cardiovascular safety liabilities led to the discovery of compound 48. Besides good potency, selectivity, and ADME properties, compound 48 displayed robust in vivo activity in a sleep-wake electroencephalogram (sw-EEG) assay consistent with mGlu2 receptor activation, in accordance with previous work from our laboratories.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Jose Mar\u00eda Cid","Guillaume Duvey","Gary Tresadern","Vanthea Nhem","Rocco Furnari","Philippe Cluzeau","Juan Antonio Vega","Ana Isabel de Lucas","Encarnaci\u00f3n Matesanz","Jos\u00e9 Manuel Alonso","Mar\u00eda Lourdes Linares","Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Andr\u00e9s","Sonia M.
