Therefore, we investigated the role of galectin-3 in herpetic allodynia. The expression levels of galectin-3 mRNA and protein were increased with a temporal pattern similar to that of herpetic allodynia. Galectin-3-expressing cells were mainly localized in the superficial dorsal horn, round in shape, and positive for the macrophage\/microglia markers Iba-1 and F4\/80. In the deep dorsal horn, there were Iba-1-positive cells with ramified and stout processes, which were negative for galectin-3. In the superficial dorsal horn, there were many CD3-positive T cells, but most of the galectin-3-expressing cells were negative for CD3. Galectin-3-expressing cells were negative for the neuronal marker NeuN and the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody. Deficiency in galectin-3 markedly reduced herpetic allodynia, without showing an effect on herpes zoster-like skin lesions. Intrathecal injection of galectin-3 produced mechanical allodynia in naive mice, and intrathecal injections of anti-galectin-3 antibodies significantly reduced herpetic allodynia. The present results suggest that galectin-3 in infiltrating macrophages and\/or resident microglia in the spinal dorsal horn contributes to herpetic allodynia. Galectin-3 may be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of herpes zoster-associated pain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003281","authors":["Kuraishi, Yasushi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pain.2011.11.022","first_seen_on":"2012-02-27T17:04:42+00:00","issns":["0304-3959"],"journal":"Pain (03043959)","last_mentioned_on":1330182033,"links":["http:\/\/www.painjournalonline.com\/article\/S0304-3959(11)00698-1\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.painjournalonline.com\/article\/S0304-3959(11)00698-1\/pdf","pmid":"22197693","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Contribution of spinal galectin-3 to acute herpetic allodynia in mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contribution-spinal-galectin3-acute-herpetic-allodynia-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3108910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":997273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77916,"mean":4.3526757363793,"rank":48607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":19238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77916,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2423,"mean":5.4436936416185,"rank":1880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2423,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":6.6004242424242,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
