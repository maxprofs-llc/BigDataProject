Past recommendations for identification of dangerous North American pit vipers have often required subjective determinations of head shape or relied on traits shared with some nondangerous species (elliptical pupils and undivided subcaudal scales). Heat-sensitive facial pits are diagnostic but require close examination of the dangerous head, and cephalic traits are useless when working with a decapitated carcass. Exclusive of cephalic traits, pit vipers north of Mexico can be recognized by the combination of keeled middorsal scales and undivided subcaudal scales. The order of colored rings is usually suggested to identify coral snakes in the United States, yet extension of the colored rings across the ventral scales must be added as an essential identifying factor to ensure elimination of all harmless look-alikes. A novel 3-step flow chart is presented that allows dangerous snakes in the United States and Canada to be recognized quickly and dependably without relying on cephalic traits. This process cannot be used in other countries, however, due to greater variability of these characteristics in snakes from other parts of the world. Finally, close examination of potentially venomous snakes is extraordinarily dangerous and steps to safeguard those making such observations are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f610006798","authors":["Cardwell MD"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.wem.2011.07.001","first_seen_on":"2012-02-28T10:23:23+00:00","issns":["1080-6032"],"issue":"","journal":"Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (Allen Press Publishing Services Inc.)","last_mentioned_on":1448931157,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21962719","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21962719?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.wemjournal.org\/article\/S1080-6032(11)00160-8\/fulltext"],"pmid":"21962719","pubdate":"2011-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Commerce, Management, Tourism And Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Recognizing Dangerous Snakes in the United States and Canada: A Novel 3-Step Identification Method","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recognizing-dangerous-snakes-united-states-canada-novel-3step-identification-method"},"altmetric_score":{"score":20.79,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":20.79},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6632903,"mean":6.1476115477016,"rank":300016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":6332994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6632903,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85027,"mean":4.8981159174841,"rank":3406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":81621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85027,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":7.7760406091371,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":7.2966666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"US":4},"mendeley":{"AT":1,"NL":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Recognizing Dangerous Snakes in the United States and Canada: A Novel 3-Step Identification Method","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=312964092061672&id=138829742132","citation_ids":[624631],"posted_on":"2011-12-02T19:55:52+00:00","summary":"Check out Editor Scott McIntosh's Editor's Choice in the new issue of WEM!","author":{"name":"Theresa Monturano","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/138829742132","facebook_wall_name":"Wilderness Medical Society","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/138829742132\/picture","id_on_source":"138829742132"}},{"title":"Recognizing Dangerous Snakes in the United States and Canada: A Novel 3-Step Identification Method","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=411732372182982&id=179954535371864","citation_ids":[624631],"posted_on":"2012-05-19T14:22:27+00:00","summary":"There is a new 3-step method for identifying whether or not a snake is poisonous.
