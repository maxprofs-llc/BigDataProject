CSCs, obtained from human myocardial bioptic specimens and grown as cardiospheres (CSps) and cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), can engraft and partially regenerate the infarcted myocardium, as previously described. In this paper we assessed the hypothesis that exposure of CSps and CDCs to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs), tuned at Ca2+ ion cyclotron energy resonance (Ca2+-ICR), may drive their differentiation towards a cardiac-specific phenotype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024b0","authors":["Gaetani R","Ledda M","Barile L","Chimenti I","De Carlo F","Forte E","Ionta V","Giuliani L","D'Emilia E","Frati G","Miraldi F","Pozzi D","Messina E","Grimaldi S","Giacomello A","Lisi A"],"doi":"10.1093\/cvr\/cvp067","first_seen_on":"2012-02-27T10:23:36+00:00","issns":["0008-6363"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cardiovascular Research","last_mentioned_on":1330337779,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19228705"],"pmid":"19228705","pubdate":"2009-02-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Differentiation of human adult cardiac stem cells exposed to extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields.","type":"article","volume":"82","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differentiation-human-adult-cardiac-stem-cells-exposed-extremely-lowfrequency-electromagnetic-fields-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3108906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":997239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77916,"mean":4.3527283578258,"rank":48604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":19220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77916,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":763,"mean":1.7738871391076,"rank":456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":763,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.8125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
