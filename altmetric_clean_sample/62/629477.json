Arginine 72 of ppR corresponds to Arg-82 of bacteriorhodopsin, which is a highly conserved residue among microbial rhodopsins. Using various Arg-72 ppR mutants, we obtained the following results: 1). Arg-72(ppR) together possibly with Asp-193 influenced the pK(a) of the counterion of the protonated Schiff base. 2). The M-rise became approximately four times faster than the wild-type. 3). Illumination causes proton uptake and release, and the pH profiles of the sequence of these two proton movements were different between R72A mutant and the wild-type; it is inferred that Arg-72 connects the proton transfer events occurring at both the Schiff base and an extracellular proton-releasing residue (Asp-193). 4). The M-decays of Arg-72 mutants were faster ( approximately 8-27 folds at pH 8 depending on mutants) than the wild-type, implying that the guanidinium prevents the proton transfer from the extracellular space to the deprotonated Schiff base. 5), The proton-pumping activities were decreased for mutants having increased M-decay rates, but the extent of the decrease was smaller than expected. The role of Arg-72 of ppR on the photochemistry was discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["Yukako Ikeura","Kazumi Shimono","Masayuki Iwamoto","Yuki Sudo","Naoki Kamo"],"first_seen_on":"2012-03-01T21:56:23+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1330638620,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1304176\/?tool=pubmed"],"pmid":"15111424","pubdate":"2004-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Biophysical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"3112","title":"Role of Arg-72 of pharaonis Phoborhodopsin (Sensory Rhodopsin II) on its Photochemistry","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-arg72-pharaonis-phoborhodopsin-sensory-rhodopsin-ii-photochemistry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3913240,"mean":5.0137767509056,"rank":3125941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":89345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3913240,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75730,"mean":4.0852288876561,"rank":54186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75730,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1811,"mean":2.6378960176991,"rank":1401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1811,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.9523076923077,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
