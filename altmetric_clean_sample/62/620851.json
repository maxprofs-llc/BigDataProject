However, tuberculosis in children is difficult to diagnose, because disease tends to be paucibacillary and sputum samples are often not easy to obtain. The diagnosis of tuberculosis in children is traditionally based on chest radiography, tuberculin skin testing, and mycobacterial staining\/culture from appropriate samples. Newer diagnostic strategies have included improved bacteriologic and molecular methods, as well as new methods for sample collection from children. Recently, immune-based diagnostics, such as the interferon-gamma release assays, have been introduced for clinical use. These tests do not offer substantial improvements in sensitivity over tuberculin skin testing for the diagnosis of active disease but may be useful in excluding false-positive tuberculin skin tests. Further research is needed to develop better diagnostic tests for tuberculosis in children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008487","doi":"10.1097\/inf.0b013e318249f26d","first_seen_on":"2012-02-25T12:20:50+00:00","issns":["0891-3668"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal","last_mentioned_on":1350593108,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pidj\/Abstract\/2012\/03000\/The_Diagnosis_of_Tuberculosis.20.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pidj\/2012\/03000\/The_Diagnosis_of_Tuberculosis.20.pdf","pmid":"22330167","pubdate":"2012-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"302","subjects":["communicablediseases","pediatrics"],"title":"The Diagnosis of Tuberculosis","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnosis-tuberculosis-34"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2120645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2224146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79002,"mean":4.4353582359716,"rank":29737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":46047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79002,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1965,"mean":2.2413309572301,"rank":707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":1163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1965,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.3123043478261,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/e_nfectopedTB\/statuses\/259032387458048001","license":"public","citation_ids":[620851],"posted_on":"2012-10-18T20:45:08+00:00","author":{"name":"e-nfectologiaped:TB","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/0lm7q7oC3t","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2734346042\/c9701fafdcf2fc1f1a5c8b7702ebd675_normal.png","id_on_source":"e_nfectopedTB","tweeter_id":"889672483","followers":0},"tweet_id":"259032387458048001"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/lstmjournals\/status\/173380491997745152","citation_ids":[620851],"posted_on":"2012-02-25T12:15:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Donald Mason Library","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_5_normal.png","description":"","id_on_source":"lstmjournals","tweeter_id":"109528074","followers":450},"tweet_id":"173380491997745152"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/pidjournal\/status\/174779135581892608","citation_ids":[620851],"posted_on":"2012-02-29T08:52:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Ped Infect Diseases","url":"http:\/\/www.pidj.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763102139925225476\/1ED8nZst_normal.jpg","description":"The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal\u00ae (PIDJ) is a complete, up-to-the-minute resource on #infectious #diseases in #children.","id_on_source":"pidjournal","tweeter_id":"339068927","geo":{"lt":39.95234,"ln":-75.16379,"country":"US"},"followers":366},"tweet_id":"174779135581892608"}]}}
