The state-of-the-art method for protein domain classification is profile HMM-based alignment. However, the relatively high rates of insertions and deletions in homopolymer regions of pyrosequencing reads create frameshifts, causing conventional profile HMM alignment tools to generate alignments with marginal scores. This makes error-containing gene fragments unclassifiable with conventional tools. Thus, there is a need for an accurate domain classification tool that can detect and correct sequencing errors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Yuan Zhang","Yanni Sun"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-12-198","first_seen_on":"2012-02-26T07:03:28+00:00","issns":["","1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1486833066,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/12\/198","http:\/\/bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2105-12-198"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcbioinformatics\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-12-198.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3115854","pmid":"21609463","pubdate":"2011-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"198","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"HMM-FRAME: accurate protein domain classification for metagenomic sequences containing frameshift errors","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2105-12-198","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hmmframe-accurate-protein-domain-classification-metagenomic-sequences-containing-frameshift-errors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8192854,"mean":6.9262032168704,"rank":2074503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4998251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8192854,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94935,"mean":5.2975331282786,"rank":22753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":65913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94935,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3587,"mean":5.0158343558282,"rank":1377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3587,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":4.4317857142857,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":31,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
