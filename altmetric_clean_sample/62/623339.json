Influent and effluent samples taken from five different wastewater treatment plants throughout Turkey namely Hurma\/Antalya, Lara\/Antalya, Kemer-1 and Kemer-2 and METU\/Ankara were analyzed for their EDCs contents under the optimum conditions. All of the parameters in the pre-concentration step were optimized and the best recoveries for all compounds of interest were achieved at pH 7 (about 100%). Progesterone was not detected in any of the treatment plants while diltiazem was found in all samples with the exception of Lara effluent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012Ana...137..884M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002247","authors":["Melis Muz","M.
