Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), the most potent toxin known in nature, is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase. Here we identify the nontoxic nonhemagglutinin (NTNHA), one of the BoNT-complex constituents, as a zinc-binding protein, along with BoNT. A protein structure classification database search indicated that BoNT and NTNHA share a similar domain architecture, comprising a zinc-dependent metalloproteinase-like, BoNT coiled-coil motif and concanavalin A-like domains. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that every single NTNHA molecule contains a single zinc atom. This is the first demonstration of a zinc atom in this protein, as far as we know. However, the NTNHA molecule does not possess any known zinc-coordinating motif, whereas all BoNT serotypes possess the classical HEXXH motif. Homology modeling of the NTNHA structure implied that a consensus K-C-L-I-K-X(35)-D sequence common among all NTNHA serotype molecules appears to coordinate a single zinc atom. These findings lead us to propose that NTNHA and BoNT may have evolved distinct functional specializations following their branching out from a common ancestral zinc protein.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Ken Inui","Yoshimasa Sagane","Keita Miyata","Shin-Ichiro Miyashita","Tomonori Suzuki","Yasuyuki Shikamori","Tohru Ohyama","Koichi Niwa","Toshihiro Watanabe"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2012.02.045","first_seen_on":"2012-02-28T00:46:08+00:00","issns":["0006291X"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1370266290,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006291X12002781"],"pmid":"22366035","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Toxic and nontoxic components of botulinum neurotoxin complex are evolved from a common ancestral zinc protein","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toxic-nontoxic-components-botulinum-neurotoxin-complex-evolved-common-ancestral-zinc-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":1990197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77903,"mean":4.3944119021334,"rank":26306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":49023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77903,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7473,"mean":2.1362315310492,"rank":4418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":3019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7473,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.1559701492537,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
