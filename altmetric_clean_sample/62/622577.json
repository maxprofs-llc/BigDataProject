Here, we analyze the role of ASCs in reducing the progression of kidney fibrosis. Progressive renal fibrosis was achieved by unilateral clamping of the renal pedicle in mice for 1 h; after that, the kidney was reperfused immediately. Four hours after the surgery, 2 \u00d7 10(5) ASCs were intraperitoneally administered, and mice were followed for 24 h posttreatment and then at some other time interval for the next 6 weeks. Also, animals were treated with 2 \u00d7 10(5) ASCs at 6 weeks after reperfusion and sacrificed 4 weeks later to study their effect when interstitial fibrosis is already present. At 24 h after reperfusion, ASC-treated animals showed reduced renal dysfunction and enhanced regenerative tubular processes. Renal mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF was decreased in ASC-treated animals, whereas IL-4, IL-10, and HO-1 expression increased despite a lack of ASCs in the kidneys as determined by SRY analysis. As expected, untreated kidneys shrank at 6 weeks, whereas the kidneys of ASC-treated animals remained normal in size, showed less collagen deposition, and decreased staining for FSP-1, type I collagen, and Hypoxyprobe. The renal protection seen in ASC-treated animals was followed by reduced serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, KC, RANTES, and IL-1\u03b1. Surprisingly, treatment with ASCs at 6 weeks, when animals already showed installed fibrosis, demonstrated amelioration of functional parameters, with less tissue fibrosis observed and reduced mRNA expression of type I collagen and vimentin. ASC therapy can improve functional parameters and reduce progression of renal fibrosis at early and later times after injury, mostly due to early modulation of the inflammatory response and to less hypoxia, thereby reducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e22","authors":["Donizetti-Oliveira C","Semedo P","Burgos-Silva M","Cenedeze MA","Malheiros DM","Reis MA","Pacheco-Silva A","C\u00e2mara NO"],"doi":"10.3727\/096368911x623925","first_seen_on":"2012-02-27T04:27:13+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Cell Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1330327107,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22305061"],"pmid":"22305061","pubdate":"2012-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"ADIPOSE TISSUE-DERIVED STEM CELL TREATMENT PREVENTS RENAL DISEASE PROGRESSION.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adipose-tissuederived-stem-cell-treatment-prevents-renal-disease-progression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2327915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1535371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77915,"mean":4.3415970942321,"rank":33138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":31960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77915,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":383,"mean":9.604335078534,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":383,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.4342222222222,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
