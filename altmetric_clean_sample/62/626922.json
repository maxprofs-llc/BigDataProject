Based on a comparison of energetic data along with computed chemical shifts and coupling constants, we suggest that the detected species share a Ru(3)(\u03bc-H)(\u03bc-H) motif, with two distinct bridging hydride sites, rather than the terminal hydride proposed previously. The work illustrates how theory can be used as a complement to spectroscopy to enhance the accuracy of deductions, and to provide a basis for future rational design of second generation catalysts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Muhsen A.
