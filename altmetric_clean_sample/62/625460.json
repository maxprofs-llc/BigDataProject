By Pe\u00f1agarikano & Geschwind ("],"citation":{"abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by the presence of repetitive\/restrictive behaviors and variable deficits in language and social behavior. Many genes predisposing an individual to ASD have been identified, and understanding the causal disease mechanism(s) is critical to be able to develop treatments. Neurobiological, genetic, and imaging data provide strong evidence for the CNTNAP2 gene as a risk factor for ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders. This review discusses the clinical genetics and current understanding of the biology of CNTNAP2 as related to ASD and illustrates how the integration of multiple research approaches, from human studies to animal models, converge to inform functional biology focused on novel treatment development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b0","authors":["Daniel H.
