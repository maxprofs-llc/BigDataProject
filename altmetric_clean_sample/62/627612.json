In this article, we explore the meaning of palliative care for HF and then discuss its relationships with both chronic care and end-of-life care. A case study is used to envision the practical implementation of palliative care into existing systems of care. We conclude by discussing the clinician's role in implementing palliative care earlier for individuals with HF by practice and advocacy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a05","doi":"10.1097\/jcn.0b013e318239f629","first_seen_on":"2012-02-29T19:44:41+00:00","issns":["0889-4655"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1381418152,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcnjournal\/Abstract\/2012\/03000\/Upstreaming_Palliative_Care_for_Patients_With.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcnjournal\/2012\/03000\/Upstreaming_Palliative_Care_for_Patients_With.8.pdf","pmid":"22210148","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"147","subjects":["nursing","cardiology"],"title":"Upstreaming Palliative Care for Patients With Heart Failure","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/upstreaming-palliative-care-patients-heart-failure-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3067542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":945174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77902,"mean":4.4133572097919,"rank":47759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77902,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":553,"mean":1.5208188405797,"rank":369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":553,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.0416666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Linguistics":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JCNonline\/status\/388321993675636736","license":"public","citation_ids":[627612],"posted_on":"2013-10-10T15:15:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Jnl of CV Nursing","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcnjournal\/pages\/currenttoc.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/527103378409541632\/NJkt1NdP_normal.jpeg","description":"The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing is one of the leading journals for advanced practice nurses in cardiovascular care.","id_on_source":"JCNonline","tweeter_id":"186503696","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":819},"tweet_id":"388321993675636736"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/JCNonline\/status\/174942740226916352","citation_ids":[627612],"posted_on":"2012-02-29T19:42:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Jnl of CV Nursing","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcnjournal\/pages\/currenttoc.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/527103378409541632\/NJkt1NdP_normal.jpeg","description":"The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing is one of the leading journals for advanced practice nurses in cardiovascular care.","id_on_source":"JCNonline","tweeter_id":"186503696","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":819},"tweet_id":"174942740226916352"}]}}
