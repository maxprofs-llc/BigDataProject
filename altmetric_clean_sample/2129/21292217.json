We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to examine the relative risk of psychological distress.\nA total of 115 couples answered the questionnaires at all four time points. Men with prostate cancer showed a significantly higher risk of psychological distress compared to men without prostate cancer at 1 (odds ratio [OR] = 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9-13.1), 3 (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.1-10.2) and 6 months following prostate cancer diagnosis (OR = 6.9, 95% CI = 2.3-25.7). Their partners showed a significantly higher risk of psychological distress compared to the partners of men without prostate cancer at 1 month following prostate cancer diagnosis (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1-6.6).\nMen with prostate cancer showed psychological distress during the 6 months following the cancer diagnosis. Their partners also showed psychological distress at 1 month following the cancer diagnosis. Inviting both men with prostate cancer and their partners to speak to their concerns, empathizing with them, finding the solutions together and monitoring of their psychological status regularly should be regarded as important following prostate cancer diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007adb","authors":["Oba, Akira","Nakaya, Naoki","Saito-Nakaya, Kumi","Hasumi, Masaru","Takechi, Hiroyuki","Arai, Seiji","Shimizu, Nobuaki"],"doi":"10.1093\/jjco\/hyx066","first_seen_on":"2017-06-23T13:00:32+00:00","issns":["0368-2811","1465-3621"],"journal":"Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1498223010,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28505354"],"pmid":"28505354","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"OUP accepted manuscript","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychological-distress-men-prostate-cancer-partners-before-after-cancer-diagnosis-longitudinal-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":3996868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4230856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237414,"mean":12.921416148231,"rank":111258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":119037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237414,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":609,"mean":2.0632993421053,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":609,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.6214285714286,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SperlingMD\/statuses\/878236275106394113","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21292217],"posted_on":"2017-06-23T13:00:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Dan Sperling","url":"http:\/\/www.sperlingprostatecenter.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000045151642\/717cd4c120dc660313e3530864b64b5d_normal.png","description":"Interventional Uroradiologist Specializing in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Using MRI guidance and Focal Laser Ablation","id_on_source":"SperlingMD","tweeter_id":"6389752","geo":{"lt":43.00035,"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US"},"followers":158},"tweet_id":"878236275106394113"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Tom21663\/statuses\/878237074788241408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21292217],"posted_on":"2017-06-23T13:03:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom S.","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1093167614\/kayak_normal.jpg","description":"Technology entrepreneur and mentor interested in helping at-risk youth achieve their full potential.","id_on_source":"Tom21663","tweeter_id":"170358978","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":551},"tweet_id":"878237074788241408"}]}}
