The first questionnaire was sent to all countries (N=18) to find out, among other issues, the priority level for strengthening a range of HIV surveillance areas and their key gaps and weaknesses. The second questionnaire was sent to 15 countries to more specifically determine capacities for the analysis of the HIV care cascade.\nResponses to the first questionnaire were received from 10 countries, whereas 13 countries responded to the second questionnaire. Areas that were most frequently marked as being of high to moderate priority for strengthening were national electronic patient monitoring systems, evaluation of HIV interventions and impact analysis, implementation science, and data analysis. Key weaknesseses were lack of electronic reporting of HIV cases, problems with timeliness and completeness of reporting in HIV cases, under-estimates of the reported number of HIV-related deaths, and limited CD4 count testing at the time of HIV diagnosis. Migrant populations, internally displaced persons, and refugees were most commonly mentioned as groups not covered by surveillance, followed by clients of sex workers and men who have sex with men. The majority of countries reported that they were able to provide the number of people diagnosed with HIV who know their HIV status, which is important for the analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal HIV care cascades. Ability to report on some of the key impact indicators of HIV programs-viral load suppression and mortality-should be considerably strengthened.\nThe assessment found a substantial need to invest in surveillance capacities, which is a cornerstone in the development of an evidence-informed response to HIV epidemics.","authors":["Ivana Bozicevic"],"doi":"10.2196\/publichealth.7357","first_seen_on":"2017-06-23T16:02:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2369-2960"],"issue":"2","journal":"JMIR Public Health and Surveillance","last_mentioned_on":1498233918,"links":["http:\/\/publichealth.jmir.org\/2017\/2\/e41\/"],"pmid":"28645888","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada","title":"HIV Strategic Information in Non-European Union Countries in the World Health Organization European Region: Capacity Development Needs","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/capacity-development-needs-hiv-strategic-information-noneuropean-union-countries-world-health-organi-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JMedInternetRes\/statuses\/878282040315187200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21296229],"posted_on":"2017-06-23T16:02:10+00:00","author":{"name":"J Med Internet Res","url":"http:\/\/www.jmirpublications.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573596706631106561\/qFzI03Du_normal.png","description":"JMIR=leading publisher of peer-reviewed, open access #ehealth, #mhealth, #digitalhealth research journals, eg J Med Internet Res.
