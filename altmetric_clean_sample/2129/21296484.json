The aryl diazotates act as protected diazonium ions, which do not undergo azo coupling with electron-rich aromatic substrates, but are still able to serve as sources for aryl radicals at slightly elevated temperatures. Based on an improved preparation of aryldiazotates in aqueous solution, homolytic aromatic substitutions of anilines and pyrroles can now be conducted with good overall yields and with high regio-selectivity. Moreover, further mechanistic insights were obtained and could be supported through calculations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Hofmann, Josefa","Gans, Eva","Clark, Timothy","Heinrich, Markus R."],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201701429","first_seen_on":"2017-06-23T16:17:27+00:00","issns":["09476539","1521-3765"],"journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1498234634,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201701429\/abstract;jsessionid=49D681F5CD4F5A677615B0189D18524B.f01t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201701429\/pdf","pmid":"28440884","pubdate":"2017-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Radical arylation of anilines and pyrroles via aryldiazotates","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radical-arylation-anilines-pyrroles-via-aryldiazotates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":7272188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237413,"mean":12.921473733425,"rank":194321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237413,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6350,"mean":3.18713907702,"rank":4586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6350,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":565,"mean":2.8573120567376,"rank":449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":565,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eduardoarmienta\/statuses\/878285832792100865","license":"gnip","rt":["ChemEurJ"],"citation_ids":[21296484],"posted_on":"2017-06-23T16:17:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Eduardo Armienta","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/834165583931392003\/XX9t_0rg_normal.jpg","description":"Research Professor \/ FCQB-UAS \/ Biochemistry Lab.","id_on_source":"eduardoarmienta","tweeter_id":"117499026","geo":{"lt":24.80737,"ln":-107.39734,"country":"MX"},"followers":786},"tweet_id":"878285832792100865"}]}}
