The study cohort was cross-matched with the Swedish National Patient Register in order to obtain data on patient history and postoperative infections. Simple and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed in order to assess the impact of various comorbidities on the risk for SSI and septicaemia.\nA total of 94,557 procedures were registered. A SSI was seen following 5300 procedures (5.6%), and septicaemia following 661 procedures (0.7%). There was a significantly increased risk for SSI in patients with connective tissue disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.404, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.208-1.633), complicated diabetes (OR 1.435, CI 1.205-1.708), uncomplicated diabetes (OR 1.391, CI 1.264-1.530), chronic kidney disease (OR 1.788, CI 1.458-2.192), cirrhosis (OR 1.764, CI 1.268-2.454) and obesity (OR 1.630, CI 1.475-1.802). There was a significantly higher risk for septicaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (OR 3.065, CI 2.120-4.430) or cirrhosis (OR 5.016, CI 3.019-8.336).\nCertain comorbidities have an impact on the risk for postoperative infection after cholecystectomy, especially SSI. This should be taken into account when planning the procedure and when deciding on prophylactic antibiotic treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003741","authors":["Gona Jaafar","Folke Hammarqvist","Lars Enochsson","Gabriel Sandblom"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00268-017-4029-0","first_seen_on":"2017-06-23T12:08:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0364-2313","1432-2323"],"journal":"World Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1498258258,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00268-017-4029-0"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00268-017-4029-0.pdf","pmid":"28634841","pubdate":"2017-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Patient-Related Risk Factors for Postoperative Infection After Cholecystectomy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patientrelated-risk-factors-postoperative-infection-after-cholecystectomy-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":2.35,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":3508091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4860542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237413,"mean":12.921468468316,"rank":90470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":144878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237413,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2412,"mean":3.8938622978017,"rank":708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":1689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2412,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":12.3121875,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"ES":1,"GB":1,"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/worldjsurg\/statuses\/878223122901553153","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21291159],"posted_on":"2017-06-23T12:08:03+00:00","author":{"name":"WJS","url":"http:\/\/springer.com\/medicine\/surgery\/journal\/268","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/755760903891652608\/QOgEdO_i_normal.jpg","description":"World Journal of Surgery, the monthly publication for clinical & experimental #surgery, surgical #education, and socioeconomic aspects of surgical care #WJS","id_on_source":"worldjsurg","tweeter_id":"2882779536","geo":{"lt":43.00035,"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US"},"followers":2209},"tweet_id":"878223122901553153"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/maidoayala\/statuses\/878261668945383424","license":"gnip","rt":["worldjsurg"],"citation_ids":[21291159],"posted_on":"2017-06-23T14:41:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Maite DominguezA","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3470304899\/720b5856a74b2c78baf6458581733bd2_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"maidoayala","tweeter_id":"407978501","geo":{"lt":43,"ln":-2.75,"country":"ES"},"followers":37},"tweet_id":"878261668945383424"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EwenGriffiths\/statuses\/878346794337538049","license":"gnip","rt":["worldjsurg"],"citation_ids":[21291159],"posted_on":"2017-06-23T20:19:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Ewen A Griffiths","url":"http:\/\/www.birmingham-upper-gastrointestinal-surgery.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000855040489\/77b9c1aaaf0dfa237dd0d71e7e9fd882_normal.jpeg","description":"Upper GI Surgeon","id_on_source":"EwenGriffiths","tweeter_id":"2236122277","geo":{"lt":52.48142,"ln":-1.89983,"country":"GB"},"followers":679},"tweet_id":"878346794337538049"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/diegosierrab\/statuses\/878384917276745730","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21291159],"posted_on":"2017-06-23T22:50:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Diego Sierra B.","url":"http:\/\/es.linkedin.com\/in\/diegosierra01","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/859568673354371073\/E6illdbm_normal.jpg","description":"Prof Surgery Department U. de La Sabana @unisabana  Staff Surgeon @clinunisabana Bogota-Colombia.
