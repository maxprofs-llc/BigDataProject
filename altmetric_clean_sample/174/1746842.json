In this work, Amblyomma cajennense (Ixodidae) midgut digestive carbohydrases were tracked with different substrates, resulting in the identification of a chitinase and an N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase and the first description of a digestive \u03b1-L-fucosidase in ticks. \u03b1-L-fucosidases are involved in various physiological processes, and digestive \u03b1-L-fucosidases have been shown to be present in other types of organisms. Amblyomma cajennense \u03b1-L-fucosidase activity was isolated using acidic and salting-out precipitations and chromatographic steps in hydrophobic and cation-exchange columns. The specificity of the isolated activity as an \u03b1-L-fucosidase was confirmed by the hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl \u03b1-L-fucopyranoside and the natural substrate fucoidan and the inhibition by fucose and deoxyfuconojirimycin. The isolated activity of \u03b1-L-fucosidase forms oligomers with molecular mass of 140 kDa or 150 kDa as determined by gel filtration and non-reducing SDS-PAGE, respectively. This particular fucosidase has an optimum pH of 5.3, is stable even at high temperatures (stable for at least 2h at 50 \u00b0C), has a Km of 45 \u03bcM to the substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl \u03b1-L-fucopyranoside and IC 50% of 327 \u03bcM to fucose and 42 pM to deoxyfuconojirimycin. The presence of digestive fucosidases in hematophagous Arthropoda may be related to defence mechanisms against host-parasite interactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dfd","authors":["Moreti R","Perrella NN","Lopes AR"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jinsphys.2013.08.008","first_seen_on":"2013-09-12T23:11:12+00:00","issns":["0022-1910"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Insect Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1379027455,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23994295"],"pmid":"23994295","pubdate":"2013-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Carbohydrate digestion in ticks and a digestive \u03b1-L-fucosidase.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbohydrate-digestion-ticks-digestive-%CE%B1lfucosidase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3550181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94823,"mean":7.7534527008502,"rank":75566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94823,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":437,"mean":2.6825504587156,"rank":316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":437,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.2996666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
