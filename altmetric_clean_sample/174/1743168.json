The study revealed profound needs in disease identification and resources awareness and utilization. Barriers to utilization were identified by participants to include lack of self-efficacy, low self-esteem, lack of trust in the health care system, limited knowledge of prostate pathology, and limited ability to pay. Participants' recommended strategies for reaching the community with prostate cancer education include traditional and nontraditional strategies. The list of recommendations exclude modern-day outlets such as handheld devices, Twitter, Facebook, blogs, wikis, and other Internet-based outlets. The findings provide a road map for program development and an intervention research agenda custom-tailored to the Georgetown community of Jackson, Mississippi.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f610000454","authors":["Ek\u00fanday\u00f2 OT","Tataw DB"],"doi":"10.1080\/10911359.2013.763707","first_seen_on":"2013-09-11T12:39:18+00:00","issns":["1937-1918"],"issue":"5","journal":"Social Work in Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1378903149,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23805806?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23805806","pubdate":"2013-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Barriers to Prostate Cancer Prevention and Community Recommended Health Education Strategies in an Urban African American Community in Jackson, Mississippi.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/barriers-prostate-cancer-prevention-community-recommended-health-education-strategies-urban-african"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":2015884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89162,"mean":7.6496011484844,"rank":46307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":23757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89162,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":3.1743243243243,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":4.3583333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FightCancerTeam\/status\/377773305283235841","license":"public","citation_ids":[1743168],"posted_on":"2013-09-11T12:39:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Fight Cancer Team","url":"http:\/\/adf.ly\/AixqZ","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1192645296\/pinkribbon1_normal.jpg","description":"Fighting cancer through early diagnosis.
