Our results showed that posttraumatic growth (PTG) presented mostly in the domain of Relating to Others and indicated that PTG was significantly related to marital status, educational level, personality, coping styles, and PTSD symptoms. Avoidance of PTSD symptoms, Openness to experience, and positive coping were significant predictors of PTG. The findings emphasize that when promoting PTG of accidentally injured patients, healthcare providers should facilitate patients utilizing personal resources, understand PTG coexists with PTSD symptoms, and adjust interventions based on the coping styles the patients have adopted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d08","authors":["Yanbo Wang","Hongbiao Wang","Ji Wang","Jing Wu","Xiaohong Liu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10880-012-9315-2","first_seen_on":"2013-09-14T10:08:20+00:00","issns":["1573-3572"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Clinical Psychology in Medical Settings","last_mentioned_on":1379153288,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22886703?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22886703","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"General Practice \/ Family Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic growth in accidentally injured patients.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-predictors-posttraumatic-growth-accidentally-injured-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2307268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1588253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95188,"mean":7.7493529578621,"rank":47638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":32800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95188,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":1.8456310679612,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.425,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
