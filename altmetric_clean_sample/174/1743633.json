We also hypothesized that endurance exercise training improves or restores NO-mediated vasorelaxation in aged aorta by reversing the detrimental effects of aging on protein:protein interaction between eNOS and its key regulatory proteins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000733b","authors":["Luttrell MJ","Seawright JW","Wilson E","Woodman CR"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00421-013-2715-7","first_seen_on":"2013-09-11T16:22:34+00:00","issns":["1439-6319"],"issue":"","journal":"European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1378916548,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23995673"],"pmid":"23995673","pubdate":"2013-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Occupational Medicine\/Industrial Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Effect of age and exercise training on protein:protein interactions among eNOS and its regulatory proteins in rat aortas.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-age-exercise-training-proteinprotein-interactions-among-enos-regulatory-proteins-rat-aortas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627775,"mean":4.946368885166,"rank":2905655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627775,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89077,"mean":7.6672089676233,"rank":70877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89077,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1319,"mean":6.4508877086495,"rank":1118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1319,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":15.981692307692,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Effect of age and exercise training on pr...
