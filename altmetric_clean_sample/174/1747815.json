Randomly distributed air holes are patterned onto a quantum cascade wafer emitting in the transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization. The advantage of employing TM polarized gain medium is that TM modes are more effectively confined in the gain region, and thus improve lasing efficiency and vertical confinement compared to TE modes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Liang, Hou Kun","Meng, Bo","Liang, Guozhen","Tao, Jin","Chong, Yidong","Wang, Qi Jie","Zhang, Ying"],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201303122","endpage":"6863","first_seen_on":"2013-09-13T09:09:10+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-4095","0935-9648"],"issue":"47","journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1393429805,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201303122\/abstract;jsessionid=C5353D5CE517EAED33629D170BA88E92.d01t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201303122\/abstract;jsessionid=8D90F8732367A4D65A5DDB99082DED69.f02t01","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/adma.201303122"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201303122\/pdf","pmid":"24030916","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"6859","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Electrically Pumped Mid\u00e2\u0080\u0090Infrared Random Lasers","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electrically-pumped-midinfrared-random-lasers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6415105,"mean":5.9877480093851,"rank":352125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":6061992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6415105,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107771,"mean":7.84194005753,"rank":8374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":99361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107771,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3264,"mean":10.13849095924,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":2903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3264,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":14.289130434783,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
