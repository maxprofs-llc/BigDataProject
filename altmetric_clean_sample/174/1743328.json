Increased intravascular coagulation and\/or hypofibrinolysis have been proposed as pathogenic mechanisms. Previous reports demonstrated significant association between incidence of ONFH and polymorphisms of genes related with thrombophilia especially in Caucasian subjects. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between genetic mutations leading to coagulation disorders and ONFH in Polish patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2474-14-264","first_seen_on":"2013-09-11T14:13:11+00:00","issns":["1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1378955421,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/14\/264\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2474-14-264.pdf","pmid":"24025446","pubdate":"2013-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"264","subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"Prevalence of genetic risk factors related with thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head in Poland","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-genetic-risk-factors-related-thrombophilia-hypofibrinolysis-patients-osteonecrosis-femora"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229091,"mean":5.9655632456766,"rank":2926267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229091,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105237,"mean":7.9395099395645,"rank":52115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":38808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105237,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1846,"mean":4.5308,"rank":1094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1846,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":3.0764814814815,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1},"mendeley":{"AR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MResearchFeed\/status\/377992551174643712","license":"public","citation_ids":[1743328],"posted_on":"2013-09-12T03:10:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Musculoskel.
