Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is detected in 30%-100% of patients with cryoglobulins. Although more than half the patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis present a relatively benign clinical course, some may present with potentially life-threatening situations. We conducted the current study to analyze the clinical characteristics and outcomes of HCV patients presenting with life-threatening cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. We evaluated 181 admissions from 89 HCV patients diagnosed with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis consecutively admitted to our department between 1995 and 2010. In addition, we performed a systematic analysis of cases reported to date through a MEDLINE search.The following organ involvements were considered to be potentially life-threatening in HCV patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis: cryoglobulinemic, biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis presenting with renal failure; gastrointestinal vasculitis; pulmonary hemorrhage; central nervous system (CNS) involvement; and myocardial involvement. A total of 279 patients (30 from our department and 249 from the literature search) fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 205 presented with renal failure, 45 with gastrointestinal vasculitis, 38 with CNS involvement, 18 with pulmonary hemorrhage, and 3 with myocardial involvement; 30 patients presented with more than 1 life-threatening cryoglobulinemic manifestation. There were 146 (52%) women and 133 (48%) men, with a mean age at diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia of 54 years (range, 25-87 yr) and a mean age at life-threatening involvement of 55 years (range, 25-87 yr). In 232 (83%) patients, life-threatening involvement was the first clinical manifestation of cryoglobulinemia. Severe involvement appeared a mean of 1.2 years (range, 1-11 yr) after the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Patients were followed for a mean of 14 months (range, 3-120 mo) after the diagnosis of life-threatening cryoglobulinemia. Sixty-three patients (22%) died. The main cause of death was sepsis (42%) in patients with glomerulonephritis, and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis itself in patients with gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and CNS involvement (60%, 57%, and 62%, respectively). In conclusion, HCV-related cryoglobulinemia may result in progressive (renal involvement) or acute (pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal ischemia, CNS involvement) life-threatening organ damage. The mortality rate of these manifestations ranges between 20% and 80%. Unfortunately, this may be the first cryoglobulinemic involvement in almost two-thirds of cases, highlighting the complex management and very elevated mortality of these cases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","doi":"10.1097\/md.0b013e3182a5cf71","first_seen_on":"2013-09-14T10:26:30+00:00","issns":["0025-7974"],"issue":"5","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1427480332,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Abstract\/2013\/09000\/Life_Threatening_Cryoglobulinemic_Patients_With.5.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/pages\/articleviewer.aspx?mobile=0&year=2013&issue=09000&article=00005&type=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23974248"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/2013\/09000\/Life_Threatening_Cryoglobulinemic_Patients_With.5.pdf","pmid":"23974248","pubdate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"273","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Life-Threatening Cryoglobulinemic Patients With Hepatitis C: Clinical Description and Outcome of 279 Patients.","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lifethreatening-cryoglobulinemic-patients-hepatitis-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6574878,"mean":6.0977594546637,"rank":2719076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3706327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6574878,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108861,"mean":7.849460205769,"rank":44771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":60647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108861,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3237,"mean":2.3693170580964,"rank":875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":2252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3237,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.43,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MedicineLWW\/status\/378827014414680064","license":"public","citation_ids":[1749918],"posted_on":"2013-09-14T10:26:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Medicine LWW","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/569172208866439168\/f3-9P_th_normal.jpeg","description":"Medicine offers open access publication of original research across a broad spectrum of medical scientific disciplines and sub-specialties.","id_on_source":"MedicineLWW","tweeter_id":"217116133","geo":{"lt":39.29038,"ln":-76.61219,"country":"US"},"followers":174},"tweet_id":"378827014414680064"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ramos_casals\/status\/581520778048512000","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1749918],"posted_on":"2015-03-27T18:18:52+00:00","author":{"name":"manuel ramos casals","url":"http:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/mramoscasals","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/546226155359973377\/W00LdhRu_normal.jpeg","description":"Systemic Autoimmune Diseases in @hospitalclinic @idibaps. #BigData #DataSharing #dataviz in Medicine.
