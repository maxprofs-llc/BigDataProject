In the developed world, glanders has been eradicated. However, prior use of B. mallei as a biological weapon and its high mortality in inhalation animal studies has affirmed B. mallei as a biodefense concern. This threat requires the development of new glanders medical countermeasures (MCMs), as there is a lack of an effective vaccine and lengthy courses of multiple antibiotics needed to eradicate B. mallei. Here, we present a literature review of human glanders in which we discuss the clinical epidemiology and risk factors, potential routes of exposure, symptoms, the incubation period, and specific diagnostics. This review focuses on pulmonary glanders, as this is the most likely outcome of a biological weapons attack. Additionally, we outline current treatment regimens and propose a clinical definition of human pulmonary glanders infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000087f","authors":["Kristopher E Van Zandt","Marek T Greer","H Carl Gelhaus"],"doi":"10.1186\/1750-1172-8-131","first_seen_on":"2013-09-12T14:20:15+00:00","issns":["1750-1172",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1505352813,"links":["http:\/\/www.ojrd.com\/content\/8\/1\/131\/abstract","http:\/\/ojrd.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1750-1172-8-131","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1750-1172-8-131"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ojrd.com\/content\/pdf\/1750-1172-8-131.pdf","pmid":"24004906","pubdate":"2013-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"131","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Glanders: an overview of infection in humans","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glanders-overview-infection-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":1950185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6448637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135318,"mean":7.1983613736635,"rank":31197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":103806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135318,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1138,"mean":4.9169674582234,"rank":306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1138,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":2.6205964912281,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
