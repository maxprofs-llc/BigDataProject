Of 26 bully sticks that were tested for bacterial contamination 1 (4%) was contaminated with Clostridium difficile, 1 was contaminated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and 1 with a tetracycline resistant Escherichia coli.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dc5","authors":["Lisa M Freeman","Nicol Janecko","J Scott Weese"],"first_seen_on":"2013-09-14T03:04:18+00:00","issns":["0008-5286"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Canadian Veterinary Journal","last_mentioned_on":1427212200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23814301","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23814301?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC3524813","pmid":"23814301","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Nutritional and microbial analysis of bully sticks and survey of opinions about pet treats.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutritional-microbial-analysis-bully-sticks-survey-opinions-about-pet-treats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":51.202,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":51.202},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4913318,"mean":5.8424647670857,"rank":85679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":4827652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4913318,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98929,"mean":7.9031712760796,"rank":3001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":95928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98929,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":540,"mean":2.0240482374768,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":540,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.6444444444444,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
