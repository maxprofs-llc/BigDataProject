RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In 2005, 2,091 middle-aged and older Chinese men and women were recruited and followed for 6 years. Baseline dairy consumption was assessed by a 74-item food frequency questionnaire. Erythrocyte fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with flame ion detector. Cardiometabolic traits were measured at both baseline and follow-up visits. RESULTS Only 1,202 (57.5%) participants reported any dairy consumption, with a median intake of 0.89 (interquartile range 0.19-1.03) serving\/day. Compared with nonconsumers, the relative risks (RRs) of type 2 diabetes among those having 0.5-1 serving\/day and >1 serving\/day were 0.70 (95% CI 0.55-0.88) and 0.65 (0.49-0.85), respectively, after multivariate adjustment (Ptrend < 0.001), which were attenuated by further adjusting for changes in glucose during follow-up (Ptrend = 0.07). Total dairy consumption was associated with favorable changes in glucose, waist circumference, BMI, diastolic blood pressure (all Ptrend < 0.05), and systolic blood pressure (Ptrend = 0.05) after multivariate adjustment, including baseline values of dependent variables. Erythrocyte trans-18:1 isomers were significantly correlated with total dairy consumption (rs = 0.37, Ptrend < 0.001), and these dairy food biomarkers were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. The RR of type 2 diabetes comparing extreme quartiles of trans-18:1 isomers was 0.82 (0.65-1.04, Ptrend = 0.02), which was attenuated after adjustment for dairy consumption (Ptrend = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS Dairy consumption was associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes and favorable changes of cardiometabolic traits in Chinese.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f8","authors":["Geng Zong","Qi Sun","Danxia Yu","Jingwen Zhu","Liang Sun","Xingwang Ye","Huaixing Li","Qianlu Jin","He Zheng","Frank B Hu","Xu Lin"],"doi":"10.2337\/dc13-0975","first_seen_on":"2013-09-13T02:26:55+00:00","issns":["1935-5548"],"journal":"Diabetes Care","last_mentioned_on":1422743408,"links":["http:\/\/care.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/09\/05\/dc13-0975.abstract.html?papetoc","http:\/\/care.diabetesjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/37\/1\/56","http:\/\/care.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/37\/1\/56.abstract?etoc","http:\/\/care.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/37\/1\/56","http:\/\/care.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/37\/1\/56.long","http:\/\/care.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/37\/1\/56.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/care.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/09\/05\/dc13-0975.full.pdf","pmid":"24026553","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Dairy Consumption, Type 2 Diabetes, and Changes in Cardiometabolic Traits: A Prospective Cohort Study of Middle-Aged and Older Chinese in Beijing and Shanghai","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dairy-consumption-type-2-diabetes-changes-cardiometabolic-traits-prospective-cohort-study-middleaged"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5557234,"mean":6.323425500065,"rank":668943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4886665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5557234,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103661,"mean":7.9174165734131,"rank":14332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":89293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103661,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4525,"mean":12.214210875332,"rank":1233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":3289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4525,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":10.675263157895,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
