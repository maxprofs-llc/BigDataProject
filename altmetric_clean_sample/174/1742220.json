Nowhere is this more evident than in the framework of validity methods and concepts. The consensus standards of the American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, and National Council on Measurement in Education have changed from \"types of validity\" (criterion, construct, and content) and \"valid instruments,\" last used in 1974, to a concept of identifying evidence for the validity of results and the use of those results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surgical education literature for the adoption of the current consensus standards.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","authors":["Korndorffer JR Jr","Kasten SJ","Downing SM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjsurg.2009.08.018","first_seen_on":"2013-09-11T02:08:34+00:00","issns":["0002-9610"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1378920613,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20103073"],"pmid":"20103073","pubdate":"2010-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"A call for the utilization of consensus standards in the surgical education literature.","type":"article","volume":"199","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/call-utilization-consensus-standards-surgical-education-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2293559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2718539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99741,"mean":7.8984707238823,"rank":40729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":58449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99741,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1382,"mean":2.2696842867487,"rank":434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1382,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":2.0799682539683,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
