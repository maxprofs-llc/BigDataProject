High-protein intake might improve protein synthesis and cell function, and prevent deterioration in mitochondrial and left ventricular function. We assessed the effects of a high-protein diet on the development of heart failure characterized by cardiac hypertrophy, impaired mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and contractile dysfunction induced by transverse aortic constriction in rats. A standard diet with 18% of energy intake from protein was compared with a high-protein diet (30% of energy intake). First, we evaluated the effects of protein intake on the development of heart failure during 14 weeks of aortic constriction, and found similar cardiac hypertrophy, contractile dysfunction, ventricular dilation, and decreased cardiac mitochondrial oxidative capacity with both 18% and 30% protein. We then assessed more advanced heart failure, with 22 weeks of aortic constriction. We again saw no difference in cardiac mass, left ventricular volume, mitochondrial oxidative capacity or resistance to permeability transition between the 18% and 30% protein diets. There was a modest but significant decrease in survival with heart failure with the 30% protein diet compared with 18% protein (p < 0.003). In conclusion, consumption of a high-protein diet did not affect cardiac mass, left ventricular volumes or ejection fraction, or myocardial mitochondrial oxidative capacity in rats with pressure overload induced heart failure, but significantly decreased survival.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000ceb","authors":["Rogerio F.
