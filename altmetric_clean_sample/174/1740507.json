Cryoimmobilization of specimens by rapid cooling followed by freeze substitution (FS) and sectioning, freeze fracture (FF) and observation of replica, or cryoelectron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) now allow visualization of biological samples close to their native state, enabling us to refine our knowledge of already known bacterial structures and to discover new ones. Application of these techniques to the new Antarctic cold-adapted bacterium Pseudomonasdeceptionensis M1(T) has demonstrated the existence of a previously undescribed cytoplasmic structure that does not correspond to known bacterial inclusion bodies or membranous formations. This structure, which we term a \"stack\", was mainly visualized in slow growing cultures of P. deceptionensis M1(T) and can be described as a set of stacked membranous discs usually arranged perpendicularly to the cell membrane, but not continuous with it, and found in variable number in different locations within the cell. Regardless of their position, stacks were mostly observed very close to DNA fibers. Stacks are not exclusive to P. deceptionensis M1(T) and were also visualized in slow-growing cultures of other bacteria. This new structure deserves further study using cryoelectron tomography to refine its configuration and to establish whether its function could be related to chromosome dynamics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Lidia Delgado","Ornella Carri\u00f3n","Gema Mart\u00ednez","Carmen L\u00f3pez-Iglesias","Elena Mercad\u00e9"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0073297","first_seen_on":"2013-09-10T12:04:02+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1378814620,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0073297"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0073297.pdf","pmid":"24039905","pubdate":"2013-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e73297","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Stack: A New Bacterial Structure Analyzed in the Antarctic Bacterium Pseudomonas deceptionensis M1T by Transmission Electron Microscopy and Tomography","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stack-new-bacterial-structure-analyzed-antarctic-bacterium-pseudomonas-deceptionensis-m1t-transmissi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627775,"mean":4.946368885166,"rank":2018046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":933488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627775,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89025,"mean":7.6713328315961,"rank":46348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":23574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89025,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64065,"mean":8.3002006431069,"rank":35547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":19420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64065,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3795,"mean":10.576607274644,"rank":2219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3795,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
