However, few published studies have examined how stress in the social environment (i.e. interpersonal stress) might developmentally inter-relate with maternal depression and contextual risks to negatively affect a child in these domains. This was the purpose of the current study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026dc","authors":["Jensen, Sarah K.
