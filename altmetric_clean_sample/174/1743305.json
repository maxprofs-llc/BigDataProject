The purpose of a consult is not to \"clear\" a patient for surgery but rather to optimize a patient's underlying disease states before they are compounded by the insult of surgery. Too often consults provide advice on subjects that are in the realm of expertise of the anesthesiologist--such as the type of anesthesia to administer or what intraoperative monitoring to use--and thus risk being ignored. Consults should instead provide specific data about the patient that are pertinent to the surgery, as well as guidance on preoperative and postoperative disease management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ee5","authors":["DAVID LUBARSKY","KEITH CANDIOTTI"],"doi":"10.3949\/ccjm.76.s4.06","first_seen_on":"2013-09-11T14:00:33+00:00","issns":["1939-2869"],"journal":"Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1410997214,"links":["http:\/\/www.ccjm.org\/content\/76\/Suppl_4\/S32.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ccjm.org\/content\/76\/Suppl_4\/S32.full.pdf","pmid":"19880834","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Giving anesthesiologists what they want: How to write a useful preoperative consult","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/giving-anesthesiologists-want-write-useful-preoperative-consult"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4268403,"mean":5.0637174657686,"rank":3210914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":872699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4268403,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93034,"mean":7.6354002343255,"rank":69567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93034,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":619,"mean":3.8627087378641,"rank":466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":619,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":8.1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
