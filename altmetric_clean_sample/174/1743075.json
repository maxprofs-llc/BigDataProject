Increase in reactive oxygen species has already been described in vivax malaria, as a result of the increased metabolic rate triggered by the multiplying parasite, and large quantities of toxic redox-active byproducts generated. The present study aimed to study the oxidative stress responses in patients infected with P. vivax, who developed jaundice (hyperbilirubinaemia) in the course of the disease, a common clinical complication related to this species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","doi":"10.1186\/1475-2875-12-315","first_seen_on":"2013-09-11T11:51:06+00:00","issns":["1475-2875"],"issue":"1","journal":"Malaria Journal","last_mentioned_on":1378900253,"links":["http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/12\/1\/315\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1475-2875-12-315.pdf","pmid":"24020374","pubdate":"2013-09-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"315","title":"Lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes activity in Plasmodium vivax malaria patients evolving with cholestatic jaundice","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lipid-peroxidation-antioxidant-enzymes-activity-plasmodium-vivax-malaria-patients-evolving-cholestat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633986,"mean":4.9208287981427,"rank":2897611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633986,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89282,"mean":7.6191796910879,"rank":70727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89282,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1323,"mean":3.4489742813918,"rank":1089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1323,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":3.4289803921569,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
