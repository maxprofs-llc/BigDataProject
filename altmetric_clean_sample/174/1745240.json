Similarly, it has been postulated that fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is an autoimmune disorder and may be associated with alterations of peripheral cutaneous nerve fibers. Accordingly, the present study aimed to determine whether the frequency of FMS is higher in patients with CIU.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd13","authors":["Mahmut Yener","Ijlal Erturan","Ali Murat Ceyhan","Esra Erkol Inal","Oya Oylum Kozano\u011flu"],"first_seen_on":"2013-09-12T10:02:51+00:00","issns":["1643-3750"],"journal":"Medical science monitor international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","last_mentioned_on":1378980155,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24022252?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24022252","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The evaluation of prevalence of fibromyalgia in patients with chronic urticaria.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-prevalence-fibromyalgia-patients-chronic-urticaria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2669930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99803,"mean":7.8971469710028,"rank":49630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":36564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99803,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":705,"mean":2.57246875,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":705,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.54166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fmauk\/status\/378096290610962432","license":"public","citation_ids":[1745240],"posted_on":"2013-09-12T10:02:35+00:00","author":{"name":"FMA UK","url":"http:\/\/www.fmauk.org","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1353706770\/fib-logo-transparent_withFMAUKText400_normal.png","description":"UK charity raising awareness for fibromyalgia.\r\nTweets by DesQ, HazelB & FionaW","id_on_source":"fmauk","tweeter_id":"86183371","geo":{"lt":"54.7023545","ln":"-3.2765753","country":"GB"},"followers":2643},"tweet_id":"378096290610962432"}]}}
