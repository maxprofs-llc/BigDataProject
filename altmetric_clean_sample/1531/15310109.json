However, resistance to OSI is likely to progress and the study of potential OSI-resistant mechanisms in advanced is necessary. Here, the OSI-resistant NCI-H1975\/OSIR cells were established. After cells developed resistance to OSI, cell proliferation was decreased while cell migration and invasion were increased. The NCI-H1975\/OSIR cells exhibited more resistance to gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, rociletinib, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil, meanwhile showing higher sensitivity to paclitaxel, when compared with NCI-H1975 cells. In addition, the NCI-H1975\/OSIR cells did not display multidrug resistance phenotype. The activation and expression of EGFR were decreased after cells exhibited resistance. Compared with NCI-H1975 cells, the activation of ERK and AKT in NCI-H1975\/OSIR cells could not be significantly inhibited by OSI treatment. Navitoclax (ABT-263)-induced cell viability inhibition and apoptosis were more significant in NCI-H1975\/OSIR cells than that in NCI-H1975 cells. Moreover, these effects of navitoclax in NCI-H1975\/OSIR cells could be reversed by pretreatment of Z-VAD-FMK. Collectively, loss of EGFR could pose as one of the OSI-resistant mechanisms and navitoclax might be the candidate drug for OSI-resistant NSCLC patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Zheng-Hai Tang","Xiao-Ming Jiang","Xia Guo","Chi Man Vivienne Fong","Xiuping Chen","Jin-Jian Lu"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.13150","first_seen_on":"2017-01-08T04:11:44+00:00","issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1483848691,"links":["http:\/\/www.impactjournals.com\/oncotarget\/index.php?journal=oncotarget&page=article&op=view&path[]=13150&pubmed-linkout=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.impactjournals.com\/oncotarget\/index.php?journal=oncotarget&page=article&op=download&path%5B%5D=13150&path%5B%5D=41693","pmid":"27835594","pubdate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Impact Journals","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Characterization of osimertinib (AZD9291)-resistant non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H1975\/OSIR cell line","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-osimertinib-azd9291resistant-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer-ncih1975osir-cell-line"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019832,"mean":6.784478957969,"rank":6940601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019832,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253388,"mean":12.691078366293,"rank":208898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253388,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8384,"mean":3.0502636287725,"rank":5861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8384,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":391,"mean":9.7658974358974,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":391,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Chemistry":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ShinHiroi\/statuses\/817946814095626240","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15310109],"posted_on":"2017-01-08T04:11:31+00:00","author":{"name":"\u65b0\u85ac\u305f\u3093","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/627672921687744512\/rm2eDI4t_normal.jpg","description":"\u5e83\u3044\u4e16\u754c\u304b\u3089\u65b0\u85ac\u3092\u3054\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u307e\u3059\n(\u514d\u8cac\u4e8b\u9805\uff09\u5f53\u8a18\u4e8b\u306f\u6b63\u78ba\u6027\u3092\u5fc3\u639b\u3051\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u500b\u4eba\u306e\u610f\u898b\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u7684\u306a\u59a5\u5f53\u6027\u3092\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u4fdd\u8a3c\u3059\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u306b\u3054\u7559\u610f\u4e0b\u3055\u3044","id_on_source":"ShinHiroi","tweeter_id":"838105746","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2385},"tweet_id":"817946814095626240"}]}}
