A 75-year-old man was referred to our hospital following the observation of a 64 mm mass in a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. A transbronchial biopsy of the mass identified the pathological presence of poorly differentiated NSCLC, with no histological signs of SCLC. No mutations were identified in the EGFR gene. A clinical diagnosis of NSCLC (cT3N3M1a, stage IV) was made following a positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan and enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging. Docetaxel and bevacizumab were selected as the first-line chemotherapy regimen; however, after two cycles, the patient developed a gastrointestinal perforation, and discontinuation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was recommended. Owing to gradual disease progression, immunotherapy with nivolumab was selected as the second-line regimen. During the immunotherapy, the tumor continued to progress and some subcutaneous tumors emerged. Biopsy of a subcutaneous tumor revealed SCLC, with positive immunostaining for cluster of differentiation 56, synaptophysin, and thyroid transcription factor-1. Serum tumor markers of SCLC were also elevated. Based on these results, we concluded that in this case NSCLC had transformed to SCLC during immunotherapy with nivolumab.","altmetric_jid":"521611793cf058827c000050","authors":["Takuma Imakita","Kohei Fujita","Osamu Kanai","Tsuyoshi Terashima","Tadashi Mio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rmcr.2017.03.019","first_seen_on":"2017-04-11T10:39:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["22130071","2213-0071"],"journal":"Respiratory Medicine Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1492243200,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28393006?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28393006"],"pmcid":"PMC5376266","pmid":"28393006","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Small cell lung cancer transformation during immunotherapy with nivolumab: A case report","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/small-cell-lung-cancer-transformation-during-immunotherapy-nivolumab-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8071305,"mean":6.8537279477937,"rank":6129634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1083263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8071305,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237556,"mean":12.907951312327,"rank":168995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237556,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":1.7243364485981,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":4.1916666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
