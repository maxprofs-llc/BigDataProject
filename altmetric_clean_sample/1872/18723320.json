A possible solution to maintain high intelligibility in noise is to pre-process the speech signal based on the estimated noise power at the position of the listener. The previously proposed AdaptDRC algorithm [Schepker, Rennies, and Doclo (2015). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 138, 2692-2706] applies both frequency shaping and dynamic range compression under an equal-power constraint, where the processing is adaptively controlled by short-term estimates of the speech intelligibility index. Previous evaluations of the algorithm have focused on normal-hearing listeners. In this study, the algorithm was extended with an adaptive gain stage under an equal-peak-power constraint, and evaluated with eleven normal-hearing and ten mildly to moderately hearing-impaired listeners. For normal-hearing listeners, average improvements in speech reception thresholds of about 4 and 8\u2009dB compared to the unprocessed reference condition were measured for the original algorithm and its extension, respectively. For hearing-impaired listeners, the average improvements were about 2 and 6\u2009dB, indicating that the relative improvement due to the proposed adaptive gain stage was larger for these listeners than the benefit of the original processing stages.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040f2","authors":["Jan Rennies","Jakob Drefs","David H\u00fclsmeier","Henning Schepker","Simon Doclo"],"doi":"10.1121\/1.4979591","first_seen_on":"2017-04-11T11:20:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0001-4966","1520-8524"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","last_mentioned_on":1491909624,"links":["http:\/\/asa.scitation.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1121\/1.4979591?af=R"],"pmid":"28464693","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Acoustical Society of America  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["audiology","speechlanguagepathology"],"title":"Extension and evaluation of a near-end listening enhancement algorithm for listeners with normal and impaired hearing","type":"article","volume":"141"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":6977654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236574,"mean":12.885390750424,"rank":193114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236574,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2889,"mean":4.0658462603878,"rank":2414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2889,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":1.3318181818182,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlackPhysicists\/statuses\/851756815473836033","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18723320],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T11:20:24+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16364},"tweet_id":"851756815473836033"}]}}
