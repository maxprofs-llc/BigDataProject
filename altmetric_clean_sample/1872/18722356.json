The saliva characteristics are controlled by many factors, including genetic factors. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the association between the genetic variations in genes expressed in enamel development with calcium and phosphorus levels in saliva. We collected 276 unrelated 12-year-old children from private and public schools. Saliva was collected for DNA extraction from oral cells and for measurement of calcium and phosphorus. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry determined calcium and phosphorus levels in whole saliva. Fifteen genetic variations in 9 genes were analyzed. The genotype was determined by real-time polymerase chain reactions. Data were analyzed using Plink with an alpha of 5%. Genetic variations in AMELX, AMNB and ESRRB were associated with the calcium level in saliva (p < 0.05). A borderline association was observed in ENAM allele distribution shown with phosphate level in saliva (p = 0.049). In conclusion, our results are the first to report that genetic variations contribute to calcium and phosphorus levels in saliva.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024b4","authors":["K\u00fcchler, Erika Calvano","Pecharki, Giovana Daniela","Castro, Myrella Lescio","Ramos, Junia","Barbosa Jr., Fernando","Brancher, Jo\u00e3o Armando","Vieira, Alexandre Rezende","Gerlach, Raquel Fernanda","Trevilatto, Paula Cristina"],"doi":"10.1159\/000450764","first_seen_on":"2017-04-11T10:22:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0008-6568","1421-976X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Caries Research","last_mentioned_on":1491906129,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28395292?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28395292","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"S.
