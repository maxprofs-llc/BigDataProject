Traditional phenotypic methods can only assign many of the Clostridium species to the genus level.\nA total of 376 non-repetitive Clostridium isolates from sterile sites were collected and subjected to MALDI-TOF Biotyper analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined, and clinical characteristics of the patients were assessed. C. innocuum isolates were characterized by genome sequencing and genotyping. We used molecular and cellular methods to explore the virulence and resistance mechanisms of C. innocuum.\nC. innocuum was the second most common species to cause EICI, only next to C. perfrigenes. All Clostridium isolates showed susceptibility to clindamycin, metronidazole, penicillin, piperacillin and ampicillin-sulbatam, while C. innocuum isolates were invariably resistant to vancomycin. Among 24 patients with EIEC caused by C. innocuum, 2 (8.3%) had diarrhea, 3 (12.5%) soft tissue infection, 6 (25%) appendicitis, and 4 (16.7%) each shock and gastrointestinal perforation. The 30-day mortality was 16.7%. C. innocuum isolated from different sites could not be separated from one another by genotyping. No known toxin genes were identified in the genome of C. innocuum but the species expressed cytotoxicity to epithelial cells. D-alanine-D-alanine ligase, alanine racemase, and D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase are three main genes responsible for vancomycin resistance in C. innocuum.\nVancomycin-resistant C. innocuum is a previously un-recognized, yet prominent cause for EICI. Genome analysis showed that the species could carry LPS-like structure that is associated with cytotoxicity to cells in vitro.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000e10","authors":["Ju-Hsin Chia","Ye Feng","Lin-Hui Su","Tsu-Lan Wu","Chyi-Liang Chen","Yi-Hua Liang","Cheng-Hsun Chiu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cmi.2017.02.025","first_seen_on":"2017-04-11T15:43:03+00:00","issns":["1198743X","1198-743X"],"journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","last_mentioned_on":1492008145,"links":["http:\/\/www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com\/article\/S1198-743X%2817%2930122-2\/abstract#.WOz5TAvYYMI.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com\/article\/S1198743X17301222\/pdf","pmid":"28254687","pubdate":"2017-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Clostridium innocuum is a significant vancomycin-resistant pathogen for extra-intestinal clostridial infection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clostridium-innocuum-significant-vancomycinresistant-pathogen-extraintestinal-clostridial-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":2.45,"6m":2.45,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063599,"mean":6.8425680134317,"rank":3318341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4737529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063599,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236809,"mean":12.892121161447,"rank":90662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":145693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236809,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1708,"mean":4.3192138254247,"rank":757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":943,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1708,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":8.5710126582278,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1,"GB":2,"US":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ESCMID\/statuses\/851822855687897088","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18726920],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T15:42:49+00:00","author":{"name":"ESCMID","url":"http:\/\/www.escmid.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706792174877212672\/QkZos8c9_normal.jpg","description":"The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. #ECCMID2016 for our congress in Amsterdam and #ECCMID2017 for ECCMID in Vienna.","id_on_source":"ESCMID","tweeter_id":"107346436","geo":{"lt":47.41667,"ln":7.75,"country":"CH"},"followers":5850},"tweet_id":"851822855687897088"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MicrobLog_me_uk\/statuses\/851827654974222336","license":"gnip","rt":["ESCMID"],"citation_ids":[18726920],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T16:01:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Abid Hussain","url":"http:\/\/www.klehub.com\/microblogmeuk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/790280619746070528\/yk72D294_normal.jpg","description":"Medical Microbiologist, currently Director of Infection Prevention & Control @heartofengland #DIPC. **ALL TWEETS MY OWN**","id_on_source":"MicrobLog_me_uk","tweeter_id":"59750982","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":1101},"tweet_id":"851827654974222336"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kdahal57\/statuses\/851944970101686273","license":"gnip","rt":["ESCMID"],"citation_ids":[18726920],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T23:48:03+00:00","author":{"name":"kumud dahal","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2949821637\/24dcca3db72b2a583a2596053ac8f170_normal.jpeg","description":"Interests: Infection in compromised hosts HIV\/ Hep C Tropical Infections Infectious Disease epidemiology","id_on_source":"kdahal57","tweeter_id":"552644651","geo":{"lt":40.00032,"ln":-89.25037,"country":"US"},"followers":180},"tweet_id":"851944970101686273"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AndyFW\/statuses\/852028135344283648","license":"gnip","rt":["ESCMID"],"citation_ids":[18726920],"posted_on":"2017-04-12T05:18:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Andreas Wendel","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000705972265\/7cf3df87c472929a8c6704bda726d733_normal.jpeg","description":"Microbiologist from D\u00fcsseldorf.
