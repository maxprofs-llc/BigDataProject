Reverse transcription\u2011polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the expression levels of miR\u2011205 in RCC tissue, normal tissue adjacent to carcinoma, RCC cells and normal renal cells. It was determined that the expression levels of miR\u2011205 in RCC tissue and cells were reduced compared with those in normal tissue and renal cells. miR\u2011205 mimics and the negative control were prepared and transfected into RCC cells. Cell viability and apoptosis were investigated using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay and Annexin V\u2011fluorescein isothiocyanate\/propidium iodide staining, respectively. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated with Transwell assays. The protein expression levels of E2F transcription factor\u00a01 (E2F1), B\u2011cell lymphoma\u20112 (Bcl\u20112), E\u2011cadherin, vimentin, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and phosphorylated AKT serine\/threonine kinase\u00a01 (p\u2011AKT) were determined with western blot analysis. It was revealed that miR\u2011205 promoted the apoptosis of RCC cells and suppressed their proliferation, metastasis and invasion compared with the negative control. The expression levels of E2F1, Bcl\u20112, vimentin and p\u2011AKT were downregulated compared with the negative control. The expression levels of E\u2011cadherin and PTEN were upregulated in the cells transfected with miR\u2011205 mimics compared with the negative control group. Therefore, it was concluded that miR\u2011205 suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in RCC cells via regulation of the PTEN\/AKT signaling pathway. The present study may contribute to future miRNA\u2011based RCC therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Huiqiang Wang","Bin Chen","Bo Duan","Jiaxin Zheng","Xinyi Wu"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2016.5589","first_seen_on":"2017-04-11T10:08:31+00:00","issns":["1791-2997","1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1491978548,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27498834?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27498834","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"miR\u2011205 suppresses cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis via regulation of the PTEN\/AKT pathway in renal cell carcinoma","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063599,"mean":6.8425680134317,"rank":6124795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1081415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063599,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236810,"mean":12.892118238749,"rank":168175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236810,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2021,"mean":1.6267237623762,"rank":719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2021,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":0.73252032520325,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/851738624949276672","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18721953],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T10:08:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":714},"tweet_id":"851738624949276672"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/852045902688567296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18721953],"posted_on":"2017-04-12T06:29:08+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
