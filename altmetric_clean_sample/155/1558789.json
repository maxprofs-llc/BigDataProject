However, self-report of pain is not available in some vulnerable populations (e.g., patients with disorders of consciousness), which leads to an inadequate or suboptimal treatment of pain. Therefore, the availability of a physiology-based and objective assessment of pain that complements the self-report would be of great importance in various applications. Here, we aimed to develop a novel and practice-oriented approach to predict pain perception from single-trial laser-evoked potentials (LEPs). We applied a novel single-trial analysis approach that combined common spatial pattern and multiple linear regression to automatically and reliably estimate single-trial LEP features. Further, we adopted a Na\u00efve Bayes classifier to discretely predict low and high pain and a multiple linear prediction model to continuously predict the intensity of pain perception from single-trial LEP features, at both within- and cross-individual levels. Our results showed that the proposed approach provided a binary prediction of pain (classification of low pain and high pain) with an accuracy of 86.3 \u00b1 8.4% (within-individual) and 80.3 \u00b1 8.5% (cross-individual), and a continuous prediction of pain (regression on a continuous scale from 0 to 10) with a mean absolute error of 1.031 \u00b1 0.136 (within-individual) and 1.821 \u00b1 0.202 (cross-individual). Thus, the proposed approach may help establish a fast and reliable tool for automated prediction of pain, which could be potentially adopted in various basic and clinical applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","authors":["Huang G","Xiao P","Hung YS","Zhang ZG","Hu L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2013.05.017","first_seen_on":"2013-06-15T10:30:24+00:00","issns":["1053-8119","10538119"],"journal":"NeuroImage","last_mentioned_on":1379941056,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1053811913005119","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23684861"],"pmid":"23684861","pubdate":"2013-05-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"A novel approach to predict subjective pain perception from single-trial laser-evoked potentials ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-approach-predict-subjective-pain-perception-singletrial-laserevoked-potentials"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":993426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3501720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89642,"mean":7.2579583226427,"rank":24015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":65298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89642,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3747,"mean":5.5404319273892,"rank":1315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3747,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":7.9498424242424,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
