In particular, little is known about the effects of plating and culture on canine hepatocytes. The goal of this study was to conduct a descriptive analysis of an in vitro canine hepatocyte system to evaluate its utility and limitations. The study objectives were to determine if canine hepatocytes shipped in suspension or pre-plated were transcriptomically different from one another and their liver of origin, and to understand temporal transcriptomic changes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5373cf058f610004676","authors":[" Amy C.
