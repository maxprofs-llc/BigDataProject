However, the underlying mechanisms are not totally understood. This study aims to investigate the effects of acute administration of different doses of ketamine on the immobility time of rats in the forced swimming test (FST) and to determine levels of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036db","authors":["Chun Yang","Yi-Min Hu","Zhi-Qiang Zhou","Guang-Fen Zhang","Jian-Jun Yang"],"doi":"10.3109\/03009734.2012.724118","first_seen_on":"2013-06-13T17:03:38+00:00","issns":["0300-9734"],"issue":"1","journal":"Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1371073893,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3572668\/"],"pmid":"22970723","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"3","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Acute administration of ketamine in rats increases hippocampal BDNF and mTOR levels during forced swimming test","type":"article","volume":"118","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-administration-ketamine-rats-increases-hippocampal-bdnf-mtor-levels-during-forced-swimming-tes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2018737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85238,"mean":7.160287222685,"rank":44817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":23791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85238,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":1.8825176470588,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
