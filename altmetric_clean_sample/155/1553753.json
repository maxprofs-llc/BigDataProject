One region of the cattle genome, located on Bos primigenius taurus chromosome 14 (BTA14), has been previously shown to be associated with stature by multiple independent studies, and contains orthologous genes affecting human height. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for BW in Brazilian Nellore cattle (Bos primigenius indicus) was performed using estimated breeding values (EBVs) of 654 progeny-tested bulls genotyped for over 777,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b8","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2156-14-52","first_seen_on":"2013-06-13T13:29:12+00:00","issns":["1471-2156"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1371202814,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2156\/14\/52\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2156-14-52.pdf","pmid":"23758625","pubdate":"2013-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"52","subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Genome-wide association study for birth weight in Nellore cattle points to previously described orthologous genes affecting human and bovine height","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-association-study-birth-weight-nellore-cattle-points-previously-described-orthologous-gen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":1811168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1639512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85243,"mean":7.1530076488117,"rank":38598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":41542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85243,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":383,"mean":3.1298272251309,"rank":188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":383,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.6996666666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
