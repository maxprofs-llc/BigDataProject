As yet, changes in Kip1 expression during the initial period following PH are not well-characterized. We investigated immediate changes in Kip1 mRNA and protein levels as well as changes in Kip1 phosphorylation in liver tissue within the relevant time window between surgery and the onset of DNA synthesis at 10-12 h. Methods: We used real-time PCR, quantitative Western blotting, and immune histochemistry on tissue samples of adult rats obtained during or between 2 and 10 h after surgical removal of two thirds of the liver to analyze Kip1 mRNA or protein levels, respectively, or to quantify nuclear expression of Kip1. Results: Kip1 mRNA was down-regulated within 4 h after PH by 60% and remained unchanged thereafter up to 10 h. With a lag phase of 2-3 h, Kip1-protein was down-regulated to a level of 40% of the control. The level of Thr187-phosphorylated Kip1 started to increase at 4 h and reached a maximum level at 8-10 h after PH. Kip1 immunoreactivity was observed in 30% of the hepatocytes before PH. Within 6-8 h after PH, more than half of the hepatocytes lost nuclear Kip1 signals. Kip1-specific micro-RNAs (miRNA221, miRNA222) were not changed upon PH. Conclusions: A portion of hepatocytes in adult rats constitutively express Kip1 and down-regulate Kip1 immediately upon PH. This response involves transcriptional processes (loss of Kip1 mRNA) as well as accelerated degradation of existing protein (increase in pThr187-phosphorylation mediating polyubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of Kip1). Kip1 down-regulation occurs precisely within the intervall between surgery and onset of DNA synthesis which supports the hypothesis that it mediates activation of G0\/0S-phase Cdk\/cyclin-complexes and re-entry of hepatocytes into the cell cycle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc19","authors":["Anne-Katrin Rohlfing","Karoline Trescher","Juliane H\u00e4hnel","Christian M\u00fcller","Jan-Peter Hildebrandt"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphys.2013.00139","first_seen_on":"2013-06-13T08:54:21+00:00","issns":["1664-042X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1371113615,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Gastrointestinal_Sciences\/10.3389\/fphys.2013.00139\/abstract?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/DownloadFile\/1\/9876\/42407\/1\/21\/fphys-04-00139_pdf","pmid":"23781207","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Partial hepatectomy in rats results in immediate down-regulation of p27Kip1 in residual liver tissue by transcriptional and post-translational processes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/partial-hepatectomy-rats-results-immediate-downregulation-p27kip1-residual-liver-tissue-transcriptio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3557138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89593,"mean":7.3219177828379,"rank":72025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89593,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1508,"mean":3.2472183145322,"rank":1118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1508,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontPhysiol\/statuses\/345101631215529984","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1553231],"posted_on":"2013-06-13T08:53:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Physiol","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Physiology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533286083207766016\/8U7NEYhH_normal.jpeg","description":"Frontiers in Physiology is the largest open-access journal in the field of Physiology.","id_on_source":"FrontPhysiol","tweeter_id":"397339470","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":2070},"tweet_id":"345101631215529984"}]}}
