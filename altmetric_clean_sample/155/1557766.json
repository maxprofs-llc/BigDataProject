However, the effect of delayed transit time on ASL can generate errors in the quantitative estimation of CBF using ASL. Furthermore, in the clinical setting, in which transit time is uncertain, the variability of the transit time in patients reduces the validity of CBF on ASL images. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of delayed transit time on ASL images compared with dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) in patients with moyamoya disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a7a","doi":"10.1097\/rli.0b013e3182981137","first_seen_on":"2013-06-14T20:03:07+00:00","issns":["0020-9996"],"issue":"","journal":"Investigative Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1392163971,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Effect_of_Delayed_Transit_Time_on_Arterial_Spin.99505.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/Abstract\/2013\/11000\/Effect_of_Delayed_Transit_Time_on_Arterial_Spin.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/9000\/00000\/Effect_of_Delayed_Transit_Time_on_Arterial_Spin.99505.pdf","pmid":"23764569","pubdate":"2013-06-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Effect of Delayed Transit Time on Arterial Spin Labeling: Correlation With Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast Perfusion Magnetic Resonance in Moyamoya Disease","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-delayed-transit-time-arterial-spin-labeling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2924422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1434709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89719,"mean":7.2683353173278,"rank":58120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":28312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89719,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":805,"mean":1.2224228855721,"rank":295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":805,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.8393076923077,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
