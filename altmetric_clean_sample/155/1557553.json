Evidence has been provided for a high density of insulin receptors in brain regions responsible for cognitive memory processes (hippocampus) and for the regulation of appetite (hypothalamus). Accordingly, in animal studies an increased insulin level in the central nervous system leads to an improvement of hippocampal memory function and a decrease of food intake. Similar results were obtained in humans using the method of intranasal administration of insulin. Intranasal insulin reaches the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid via the olfactory epithelium and olfactory nerve fiber bundles leading through the lamina cribrosa to the olfactory bulb. Thus, this method renders the investigation of specific insulin effects in humans possible. The therapeutic potential of an intranasal insulin administration for the treatment of diseases for which an imbalance of the central nervous insulin metabolism is discussed (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus and obesity) can only be estimated with the help of further clinical studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003184","doi":"10.1007\/s00115-013-3806-8","first_seen_on":"2013-06-14T17:31:07+00:00","issns":["1433-0407"],"journal":"Nervenarzt","last_mentioned_on":1371322406,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23760596"],"pmid":"23760596","pubdate":"2013-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"[Targeting the brain through the nose : Effects of intranasally administered insulin.]","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/von-der-nase-ins-gehirn-effekte-intranasal-verabreichten-insulins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2055054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2956012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94180,"mean":7.3909057008464,"rank":33365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":60235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94180,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":371,"mean":2.0365891891892,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":371,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.6233333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/benrattray\/statuses\/345977364246831104","license":"datasift","rt":["whsource"],"citation_ids":[1557553],"posted_on":"2013-06-15T18:53:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Ben Rattray","url":"http:\/\/en.wikiversity.org\/wiki\/User:Benrattray","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/844114017366945792\/lAE5ZKVg_normal.jpg","description":"#Orienteer, Associate Professor in Exercise Physiology @ActiveBrainUC, @uc_rise & @unicanberra, #beer & #coffee Drinker","id_on_source":"benrattray","tweeter_id":"29892848","geo":{"lt":-35.28346,"ln":149.12807,"country":"AU"},"followers":941},"tweet_id":"345977364246831104"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/whsource\/statuses\/345594210776412160","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1557553],"posted_on":"2013-06-14T17:30:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Stephan Guyenet, PhD","url":"http:\/\/www.stephanguyenet.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2683888668\/6ae8d6cda7d7f091f7ffd987dbadaa72_normal.jpeg","description":"The neuroscience of eating behavior and obesity.
