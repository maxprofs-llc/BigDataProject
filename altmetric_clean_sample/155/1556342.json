We first show that (1) pure polyproline II (pPII) coils, (2) statistical coils with different fractions pPII, \u03b2-strand, and right-handed helical residue conformations, and (3) ideal random coils (nearly equal probabilities for pPII, \u03b2, and right-handed helical) can be discriminated based on their respective VCD signal and, to a more limited extent, by means of the peak positions and asymmetries of the corresponding IR and Raman bands. Since molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of unfolded peptides (e.g., A\u03b2-segments) suggest a mixture of statistical coil and temporarily folded conformations, we calculated the amide I profiles of such mixtures composed of helical, \u03b2-strand, and disordered conformers and show that they give rise to rather distinct amide I profiles. Mixtures of regular structures with statistical coil segments can be discriminated from pure statistical and random coils by the amplitude of the negative amide I couplet in the VCD spectrum. We finally demonstrate the usefulness of such simulations by applying them to monomeric state of salmon calcitonin and the amyloid \u03b2 fragment A\u03b21-28, for which NMR data provide evidence for a coexistence between statistical coil and helical conformations. Altogether, our results show that the combined use of the four amide I profiles provides spectroscopists with a powerful tool to discriminate between different conformational manifolds that long unfolded and disordered peptides and proteins might adopt in solution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","doi":"10.1021\/jp402869k","first_seen_on":"2013-06-14T10:51:55+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1371207090,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jp402869k"],"pmid":"23631686","pubdate":"2013-05-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Different Degrees of Disorder in Long Disordered Peptides Can Be Discriminated By Vibrational Spectroscopy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/different-degrees-disorder-long-disordered-peptides-discriminated-vibrational-spectroscopy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4509149,"mean":5.2377591184699,"rank":3052656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":884308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4509149,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89727,"mean":7.3574029601232,"rank":60473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":16069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89727,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2429,"mean":1.4812924217463,"rank":1040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2429,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":2.21596875,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
