An analogous reaction for the less bulky ligand, N-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)aniline LB produced only cis-[PtClLB(dmso)], 2. The reactions of these dmso complexes with triphenylphosphine also yielded complexes with different geometries depending on the nature of the salicylaldiminato ligand. Thus the cis-trans isomerization of cis-[PtClLA(PPh\u2083)] 3a was investigated both experimentally and computationally, and a tetrahedral transition state was detected in this process. A good agreement of the experimental activation parameters with those determined theoretically using DFT was obtained. LA was also reacted with [PtClMe(cod)] in methanol to yield the corresponding salicylaldiminato complex 6 in which the methyl group is cis to the imine nitrogen. X-ray crystal structures of some compounds obtained are reported.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Selwyn Frank Mapolie","Feng Zheng","Cornie van Sittert","A T Hutton","John Moss","Alan T.
