A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 5\/79 plays a key role in postsynaptic signalling of excitatory synapses. We aimed to reveal if the cellular expression of AKAP5\/79 protein is altered in the anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in bipolar disorder. Ten subjects with bipolar disorder and ten control cases were investigated by use of immunohistochemical and morphometric techniques. Compared with controls in subjects with bipolar disorder, the numerical density of AKAP5-expressing neurons was significantly increased in the left (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and right (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) anterior cingulate cortex. Layer-specific counting revealed that left side layers II (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000), III (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and V (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) as well as right side layers III (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), IV (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and V (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) had significantly increased AKAP5-positive cell densities in bipolar disorder. In contrast, no statistically significant differences were found for the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, we observed a more intense intraneuronal immunostaining in both prefrontal areas in bipolar disorder patients. Elevated cell numbers and increased intracellular expression of AKAP, together with the altered expression patterns of most intracellular interaction partners of this protein in bipolar disorder as known from the literature, might point to disease-related abnormalities of the AKAP-associated signalosome in prefrontal cortex neurons.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ee6","authors":["Bernstein HG","Dobrowolny H","Schott BH","Gorny X","Becker V","Steiner J","Seidenbecher CI","Bogerts B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpsychires.2012.12.020","first_seen_on":"2013-06-16T03:11:56+00:00","issns":["0022-3956"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Psychiatric Research","last_mentioned_on":1390410872,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23462372","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23462372?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23462372","pubdate":"2013-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Increased density of AKAP5-expressing neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of subjects with bipolar disorder.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-density-akap5expressing-neurons-anterior-cingulate-cortex-subjects-bipolar-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4710546,"mean":5.7127347510756,"rank":459893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4247771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4710546,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83918,"mean":7.8239565046416,"rank":10967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":72902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83918,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1015,"mean":5.6317554240631,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1015,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":8.89005,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bipolar_Blogs\/status\/425952781992607744","license":"public","citation_ids":[1559758],"posted_on":"2014-01-22T11:27:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Bipolar Blogs","url":"http:\/\/www.pathsoflight.us\/bipolarwinds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3605210516\/e9da8d6cabf3994c6ec4ab42483804b9_normal.png","description":"Blogs & news from the minds of people living with bipolar and researchers.
