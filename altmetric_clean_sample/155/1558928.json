This study evaluated a telehealth application to support family dementia caregivers providing homecare. We explored feasibility of in-home video monitoring and feedback to help caregivers and reduce caregiving burden. A caregiver-patient dyad was recruited from a Midwestern University Alzheimer's Disease Center. The caregiver triggered video recordings on a laptop computer using a remote control that also recorded 5 min prior to pressing \"record.\" Recordings were automatically uploaded via the Internet for interdisciplinary team review and feedback. Issues related to Internet transfer and storage of health information and computer security were addressed. Professionals reported the value of video recordings for identifying antecedents and evaluating caregiver responses. The caregiver reported improved communication and behavior management and ease of use. This study developed protocols, processes, and contractual arrangements and established the feasibility and benefits of home monitoring as a basis for ongoing research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002568","authors":["Kristine Williams","Anne Arthur","Michelle Niedens","Lois Moushey","Lewis Hutfles"],"doi":"10.1177\/1054773812460545","endpage":"150","first_seen_on":"2013-06-15T13:02:23+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1552-3799","1054-7738"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Nursing Research","last_mentioned_on":1371333762,"links":["http:\/\/cnr.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/2\/139.abstract?ijkey=ewqludGBF5.hc&keytype=ref&siteid=spcnr"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cnr.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/2\/139.full.pdf","pmid":"22997349","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"139","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"In-Home Monitoring Support for Dementia Caregivers A Feasibility Study","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhome-monitoring-support-dementia-caregivers-feasibility-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4202648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94115,"mean":7.3811513058633,"rank":78050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94115,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":2.7197887323944,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.1875,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
