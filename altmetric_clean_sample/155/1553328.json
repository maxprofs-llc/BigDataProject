Knee involvement is commonly seen among children with arthrogryposis, with flexion contracture of the knee being the most frequent knee deformity. Knee flexion contractures in the pediatric population are particularly debilitating as they affect ambulation. Treatment for knee flexion contractures requires numerous orthopaedic procedures and an extensive follow-up period. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of orthopaedic procedures, namely distal femoral supracondylar extension osteotomy and\/or Ilizarov external fixator, on the ambulation status of children with knee flexion contracture and whether any functional gains are maintained at the latest follow-up.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd4","doi":"10.1097\/bpo.0b013e3181f5a0c8","first_seen_on":"2013-06-13T09:45:59+00:00","issns":["0271-6798"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics","last_mentioned_on":1371116727,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/Abstract\/2010\/12000\/Ambulation_Gains_After_Knee_Surgery_in_Children.18.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/2010\/12000\/Ambulation_Gains_After_Knee_Surgery_in_Children.18.pdf","pmid":"21102214","pubdate":"2010-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"863","subjects":["orthopedics","pediatrics"],"title":"Ambulation Gains After Knee Surgery in Children With Arthrogryposis","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ambulation-gains-after-knee-surgery-children-arthrogryposis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770902,"mean":5.7220129992239,"rank":3380772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":776531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770902,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91809,"mean":7.4878072063437,"rank":62736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":15444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91809,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1338,"mean":1.9182543006731,"rank":851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1338,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":3.375,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
