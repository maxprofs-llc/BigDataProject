Data were collected at residual volume (RV) and total lung capacity (TLC). Spirometry data were obtained immediately prior to scanning. To test for statistical significance between RV and TLC shear stiffness estimates a two-sample t-test was performed. To assess variability within individual subject shear stiffness estimates, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Krippendorff's alpha were calculated.\nPatients with ILD exhibited an average (\u00b11 standard deviation) shear stiffness of 2.74 (\u00b10.896) kPa at TLC and 1.32 (\u00b10.300) kPa at RV. The corresponding values for healthy individuals were 1.33 (\u00b10.195) kPa and 0.849 (\u00b10.250) kPa, respectively. The difference in shear stiffness between RV and TLC was statistically significant (P < 0.001). At TLC, the ICC and alpha values were 0.909 and 0.887, respectively. At RV, the ICC and alpha values were 0.852 and 0.862, respectively.\nIn subjects with known fibrotic interstitial lung disease, parenchymal shear stiffness is increased when compared to normal controls at both RV and TLC, with TLC demonstrating the most significant difference. MRE-derived parenchymal shear stiffness is a promising new noninvasive imaging-based biomarker of interstitial lung disease.\n1 J. Magn. Reson.
