Capacity is to be \"construed functionally\" and interventions must be \"for the benefit of the relevant person\". The Act outlines three levels of decision-making assistance: \"decision-making assistant\", \"co-decision-maker\" (joint decision-maker) and \"decision-making representative\" (substitute decision-maker). There are procedures relating to \"enduring power of attorney\" and \"advance healthcare directives\"; in the case of the latter, a \"refusal of treatment\" can be legally binding, while a \"request for a specific treatment\" must \"be taken into consideration\".\nThe 2015 Act is considerably more workable than the 2013 Bill that preceded it. Key challenges include the subtle decision-making required by patients, healthcare staff, Circuit Court judges and the director of the Decision Support Service; implementation of \"advance healthcare directives\", especially if they do not form part of a broader model of advance care planning (incorporating the flexibility required for unpredictable future circumstances); and the over-arching issue of logistics, as very many healthcare decisions are currently made in situations where the patient's capacity is impaired. A key challenge will lie in balancing the emphasis on autonomy with principles of beneficence, mutuality and care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a8e","authors":["B. D.
