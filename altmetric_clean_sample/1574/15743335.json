Although the detrimental consequence the BBB breakdown may have in the clinical settings, the timing of its alteration remains elusive for many neurodegenerative diseases. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that BBB disruption in HD is not confined to established symptoms, but occurs early in the disease progression. Despite the obvious signs of impaired BBB permeability were only detectable in concomitance with the onset of the disease, signs of deranged TJs integrity occur precociously in the disease and precede the onset of overt symptoms. To our perspective this finding may add a new dimension to the horizons of pathological mechanisms underlying this devastating disease, however much remains to be elucidated for understanding how specific BBB drug targets can be approached in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Alba Di Pardo","Enrico Amico","Francesco Scalabr\u00ec","Giuseppe Pepe","Salvatore Castaldo","Francesca Elifani","Luca Capocci","Claudia De Sanctis","Laura Comerci","Francesco Pompeo","Maurizio D\u2019Esposito","Stefania Filosa","Stefania Crispi","Vittorio Maglione"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep41316","first_seen_on":"2017-01-24T16:44:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1485276249,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep41316"],"pmid":"28117381","pubdate":"2017-01-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Blood\u2013brain barrier","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Diseases of the nervous system","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"41316","subjects":["science"],"title":"Impairment of blood-brain barrier is an early event in R6\/2 mouse model of Huntington Disease","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impairment-bloodbrain-barrier-early-event-r62-mouse-model-huntington-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093786,"mean":6.8854606510969,"rank":7007082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093786,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260776,"mean":12.833667015626,"rank":215683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260776,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33425,"mean":14.88424892293,"rank":28261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33425,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3241,"mean":17.267674074074,"rank":2643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3241,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
