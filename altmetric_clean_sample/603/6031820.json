IJPTCC 52:1"],"citation":{"abstract":"Forensic psychiatric reports on 166 sexual homicide perpetrators in Germany were retrospectively analyzed for criminal risk factors. Follow-up information about release and reconvictions from federal criminal records was available for 139 offenders; 90 (64.7%) had been released. The estimated recidivism rate (Kaplan-Meier analyses) for 20 years at risk was 23.1% for sexual and 18.3% for nonsexual violent reoffences. Three men (3.3%) were reconvicted for attempted or completed homicide. Only young age at the time of sexual homicide resulted in higher sexual recidivism, whereas increased nonsexual violent recidivism was related to previous sexual and nonsexual delinquency, psychopathic symptoms, and higher scores in risk assessment instruments. Increased recidivism with any violent reoffence was associated with age-related factors: young age at first sexual offence, at homicide, and at release and duration of detention. The impacts of the results for risk assessment, relapse prevention, and supervision are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017fa","authors":["Andreas Hill","Niels Habermann","Dietrich Klusmann","Wolfgang Berner","Peer Briken"],"doi":"10.1177\/0306624x07307450","endpage":"20","first_seen_on":"2016-03-01T22:19:50+00:00","issns":["0306-624X","1552-6933"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology","last_mentioned_on":1456870771,"links":["http:\/\/ijo.sagepub.com\/content\/52\/1\/5.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ijo.sagepub.com\/content\/52\/1\/5.full.pdf","pmid":"17954927","pubdate":"2008-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Criminology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"5","subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Criminal Recidivism in Sexual Homicide Perpetrators","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/criminal-recidivism-sexual-homicide-perpetrators"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7325869,"mean":6.3768565404091,"rank":6331557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7325869,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282583,"mean":10.65571426347,"rank":238206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282583,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":626,"mean":3.0585824,"rank":523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":626,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.68304,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
