In this paper, a predator-prey system of Leslie type with diffusion and time delay is studied based on mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. Conditions for both delay induced and diffusion induced Turing instability are obtained by using bifurcation theory. Furthermore, a series of numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the spatial patterns, which reveal the information of density changes of both prey and predator populations. The obtained results show that the interaction between diffusion and time delay may give rise to rich dynamics in ecosystems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Caiyun Wang","Lili Chang","Huifeng Liu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0150503","first_seen_on":"2016-03-01T21:21:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1456867098,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0150503"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0150503.PDF","pmid":"26930573","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0150503","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Spatial Patterns of a Predator-Prey System of Leslie Type with Time Delay","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spatial-patterns-predatorprey-system-leslie-type-time-delay"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7325869,"mean":6.3768565404091,"rank":5535538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":994348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7325869,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282582,"mean":10.655757103273,"rank":198358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282582,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105098,"mean":10.119169433952,"rank":76915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":16461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105098,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5441,"mean":12.007926470588,"rank":4234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5441,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Mathematics":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/conservbytes\/statuses\/704777808346656768","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6031625],"posted_on":"2016-03-01T21:18:18+00:00","author":{"name":"ConservationBytes","url":"http:\/\/ConservationBytes.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/689225316\/shark-eat-shark_normal.jpg","description":"Prof Corey Bradshaw, #Biowealth\ud83d\udc1e\ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udc38\ud83d\udc06\ud83d\udc27\ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc63 Scientist.
