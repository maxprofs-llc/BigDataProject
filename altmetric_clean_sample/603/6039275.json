Self-rating measurements and olfactory event-related potentials were used and compared in order to evaluate the impact of this treatment on the olfactory system.\nNine patients underwent subjective evaluation of olfactory function (using visual analogue scales for olfactory symptoms and quality of life, and a six-item Hyposmia Rating Scale), and a quantitative and objective measurement (olfactory event-related potentials).\nSpearman's rank correlation analyses highlighted significant relationships between the clinical scales and olfactory event-related potentials. Inter-group analyses showed significant differences in the latency and in the amplitude of olfactory event-related potentials between patients and controls.\nTaking into account the small sample size and the lack of pre-treatment assessment, olfactory event-related potentials seemed to allow a more objective diagnosis of unilateral and bilateral olfactory loss. Moreover, olfactory event-related potentials and subjective scales results were concordant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e18","authors":["B\u00a0Galletti","R\u00a0Santoro","V K\u00a0Mannella","F\u00a0Caminiti","L\u00a0Bonanno","S\u00a0De Salvo","G\u00a0Cammaroto","F\u00a0Galletti","Galletti, B","Santoro, R","Mannella, V K","Caminiti, F","Bonanno, L","De Salvo, S","Cammaroto, G","Galletti, F"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0022215116000761","first_seen_on":"2016-03-02T11:23:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-5460"],"journal":"Journal of Laryngology & Otology","last_mentioned_on":1457227749,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10210579&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=JLO","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26931794?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S0022215116000761","pmid":"26931794","pubdate":"2016-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Olfactory event-related potentials: a new approach for the evaluation of olfaction in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with chemo-radiotherapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/olfactory-eventrelated-potentials-new-approach-evaluation-olfaction-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma-patient"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7356005,"mean":6.3917145915054,"rank":3336079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3855985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7356005,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282031,"mean":10.659736538666,"rank":127885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":144551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282031,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1025,"mean":2.296013671875,"rank":350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1025,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.2775,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
