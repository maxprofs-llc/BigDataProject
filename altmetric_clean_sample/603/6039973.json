Most studies conducted on the psychopharmacological treatment of SAD also include patients with schizophrenia or other psychotic illnesses, thereby providing an unspecific view to the clinician as to the best way of treating patients with SAD. The objective of this article is to review studies on evidence-based treatment of patients with SAD. We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE\/PubMed for full-text studies in the English language using the terms 'Schizoaffective and treatment' or 'antipsychotic schizoaffective'. Our review found relatively few studies with either an active comparator or placebo that examined the efficacy of antipsychotics for patients with SAD without an admixture of patients with schizophrenia. Only oral paliperidone extended release (ER), paliperidone long-acting injection (LAI), and risperidone have been shown to be effective and safe in reducing psychotic as well as affective components in acutely ill SAD patients in controlled studies. Paliperidone ER and LAI have also been shown to be efficacious in the maintenance treatment phase of SAD patients. While no supportive data exist, it is possible that other atypical antipsychotics may have similar efficacy to the two mentioned above. We conclude with a number of research recommendations for the study of treatment options for patients with SAD. First, there is a need for studies with patients specifically diagnosed with SAD for both the acute and the maintenance phase. The sample size needs to be adequate to allow a primary analysis of efficacy and to allow for analysis of the SAD subtypes: depressed and bipolar. Another recommendation is the need for studies of patients with SAD stratified into patients with and without mood stabilizers or antidepressants to allow the examination of the adjunctive role of these psychotropic medications. A third recommendation is to focus on specific co-morbid aspects of patients with SAD, such as suicidality and substance use disorders. Data from such studies will fill the gap of evidence-based treatment approaches and help clinicians in making important treatment decisions for patients with this complex condition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002738","authors":["Lindenmayer, Jean-Pierre","Kaur, Amandeep"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40265-016-0551-x","first_seen_on":"2016-03-02T12:23:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0012-6667"],"journal":"Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1456923031,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26927951?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26927951?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26927951","pubdate":"2016-03-02T22:01:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Antipsychotic Management of Schizoaffective Disorder: A Review","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antipsychotic-management-schizoaffective-disorder-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7342039,"mean":6.3783632029643,"rank":5550812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":994568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7342039,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281940,"mean":10.656076740004,"rank":197948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281940,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1323,"mean":3.4045052950076,"rank":1124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1323,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.04,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
