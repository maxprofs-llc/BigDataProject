Interestingly, centenarians' offspring are prone to achieve longevity. Here we recruited 60 longevity families and investigated the blood biochemical indexes of family members to seek candidate factors associated with familial longevity. First, associations of blood indexes with age were tested. Second, associations of blood parameters in centenarians (CEN) with their first generation of offspring (F1) and F1 spouses (F1SP) were analyzed. Third, genes involved in regulating target factors were investigated. We found that total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) increased with age (20-80 years), but decreased in CEN. Similarly, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and blood creatinine (BCr) increased with age (20-80 years), but were maintained on a plateau in CEN. Importantly, we first revealed dual changes in blood pressure, i.e., decreased diastolic blood pressure but increased systolic blood pressure in CEN, which associated with altered CST3 expression. Genetic analysis revealed a significant association of blood uric acid (BUA) and BCr in CEN with F1 but not with F1SP, suggesting they may be heritable traits. Taken together, our results suggest serum lipids, kidney function and especially diastolic pressure rather than systolic pressure were improved in CEN or their offspring, suggesting these factors may play an important role in familial longevity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yong-Han He","Shao-Yan Pu","Fu-Hui Xiao","Xiao-Qiong Chen","Dong-Jing Yan","Yao-Wen Liu","Rong Lin","Xiao-Ping Liao","Qin Yu","Li-Qin Yang","Xing-Li Yang","Ming-Xia Ge","Ying Li","Jian-Jun Jiang","Wang-Wei Cai","Qing-Peng Kong"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep21962","first_seen_on":"2016-03-01T20:26:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1482854400,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep21962?utm_content=bufferd9cbe&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4766395\/","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep21962","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep21962?utm_content=buffercb835&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"26911903","pubdate":"2016-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gene expression","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Geriatrics","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"21962","subjects":["science"],"title":"Improved lipids, diastolic pressure and kidney function are potential contributors to familial longevity: a study on 60 Chinese centenarian families","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improved-lipids-diastolic-pressure-kidney-function-potential-contributors-familial-longevity-study-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.608,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.608},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7942916,"mean":6.7127945609325,"rank":670905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7271872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7942916,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286907,"mean":10.829971851407,"rank":35284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":251618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286907,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31994,"mean":14.920883318226,"rank":5238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":26757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31994,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3061,"mean":15.498450326797,"rank":533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":2528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3061,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1,"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SamuelFurse\/statuses\/704762246510067712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6031430],"posted_on":"2016-03-01T20:16:28+00:00","author":{"name":"The Lipid Chronicles","url":"http:\/\/www.thelipidchronicles.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/732491728234516480\/ATilq-y-_normal.jpg","description":"Feed of new #lipid #research covering both structure and signalling.
