The polymorphic compositions of the synthesized beta zeolites were determined by the complementary characterization methods (19)F NMR analysis and PXRD simulation. With a variety of SDAs, a high HF concentration (HF\/SDA > 1.0) in the synthesis medium results in the A-rich feature (55-65% A) of beta zeolites, while a moderate HF concentration only results in typical beta zeolites. A systematic study on the synthesis conditions reveals the existence of a buffered system of H(+) and F(-) formed in the highly HF-concentrated medium. This buffer results in a small but continuous supply of F(-) during zeolite crystallization, in contrast to the conventional fluoride route where all F(-) are discharged all-at-once at the initial stage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Guanqun Zhang","Bingchun Wang","Weiping Zhang","Mingrun Li","Zhijian Tian"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6dt00424e","endpage":"6640","first_seen_on":"2016-03-01T15:41:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"15","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1456845994,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT00424E?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/dt\/c6dt00424e","pmid":"26974286","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"6634","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of polymorph A-enriched Beta Zeolites in HF-Concentrated System","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-polymorph-aenriched-beta-zeolites-hfconcentrated-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7325869,"mean":6.3768565404091,"rank":6331521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7325869,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282583,"mean":10.655691261297,"rank":238185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282583,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10517,"mean":0.67382255610498,"rank":2944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10517,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":491,"mean":0.95805714285714,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":491,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
