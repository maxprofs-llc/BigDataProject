However, as the pancreas is particularly susceptible to ischaemic-reperfusion injury, the criteria for pancreas and islet donation are especially strict. With a chronic shortage of donors, one critical challenge is to maximise organ availability and expand the donor pool. To achieve that, continuous improvement in organ preservation is required, with the aims of reducing ischaemia-reperfusion injury, prolong preservation time and improve graft function. Static cold storage, the only method used in clinical pancreas and islet cell transplant currently, has likely reached its plateau. Machine perfusion, hypothermic or normothermic, could hold the key to improving donor pancreas quality as well as quantity available for transplant. This article reviews the literature on experimental models of pancreas machine perfusion, examines the benefits of machine perfusion, the technical aspects and their clinical implications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008bee","authors":["Kean Guan Kuan","Mau Nam Wee","Wen Yuan Chung","Rohan Kumar","Soeren Torge Mees","Ashley Dennison","Guy Maddern","Markus Trochsler"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.trre.2015.06.002","endpage":"47","first_seen_on":"2016-03-01T15:45:06+00:00","issns":["1557-9816","0955-470X","0955470X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Transplantation Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1456975801,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0955470X15000531"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.transplantationreviews.com\/article\/S0955470X15000531\/pdf","pmid":"26253243","pubdate":"2015-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"31","title":"Extracorporeal machine perfusion of the pancreas: technical aspects and its clinical implications \u2013 a systematic review of experimental models","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0955470X15000531","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extracorporeal-machine-perfusion-pancreas-technical-aspects-clinical-implications-systematic-review-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7346659,"mean":6.3824921979455,"rank":6351683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7346659,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282684,"mean":10.657408284191,"rank":238458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282684,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.2212592592593,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.72857142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
