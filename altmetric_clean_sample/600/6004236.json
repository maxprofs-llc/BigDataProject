We identify the let-7 targets HMGA2, LIN28B and IGF2BP1 to form a let-7 antagonizing self-promoting oncogenic triangle. Surprisingly, 3'-end processing of IGF2BP1 mRNAs is unaltered in aggressive cancers and tumor-derived cells although IGF2BP1 synthesis was proposed to escape let-7 attack by APA-dependent (alternative polyadenylation) 3' UTR shortening. However, the expression of the triangle factors is inversely correlated with let-7 levels and promoted by LIN28B impairing let-7 biogenesis. Moreover, IGF2BP1 enhances the expression of all triangle factors by recruiting the respective mRNAs in mRNPs lacking AGO proteins and let-7 miRNAs. This indicates that the downregulation of let-7, largely facilitated by LIN28B upregulation, and the protection of let-7 target mRNAs by IGF2BP1-directed shielding in mRNPs synergize in enhancing the expression of triangle factors. The oncogenic potential of this triangle was confirmed in ovarian cancer (OC)-derived ES-2 cells transduced with let-7 targeting decoys. In these, the depletion of HMGA2 only diminishes tumor cell growth under permissive conditions. The depletion of LIN28B and more prominently IGF2BP1 severely impairs tumor cell viability, self-renewal and 2D as well as 3D migration. In conclusion, this suggests the targeting of the HMGA2-LIN28B-IGF2BP1 triangle as a promising strategy in cancer treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Bianca Busch","Nadine Bley","Simon M\u00fcller","Markus Gla\u00df","Danny Misiak","Marcell Lederer","Martina Vetter","Hans-Georg Strau\u00df","Christoph Thomssen","Stefan H\u00fcttelmaier","Busch, Bianca","Bley, Nadine","M\u00fcller, Simon","Gla\u00df, Markus","Misiak, Danny","Lederer, Marcell","Vetter, Martina","Strau\u00df, Hans-Georg","Thomssen, Christoph","H\u00fcttelmaier, Stefan"],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gkw099","first_seen_on":"2016-02-25T18:33:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1457366567,"links":["http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/24\/nar.gkw099.full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26917013?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/24\/nar.gkw099.full.pdf","pmid":"26917013","pubdate":"2016-02-27T22:01:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The oncogenic triangle of HMGA2, LIN28B and IGF2BP1 antagonizes tumor-suppressive actions of the let-7 family","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oncogenic-triangle-hmga2-lin28b-igf2bp1-antagonizes-tumorsuppressive-actions-let7-family"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7361309,"mean":6.3962513384811,"rank":1759191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4623063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7361309,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282828,"mean":10.464544276183,"rank":87976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":189269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282828,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10087,"mean":4.4224247471743,"rank":2887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":4594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10087,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276,"mean":5.4970618181818,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
