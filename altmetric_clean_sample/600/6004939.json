These include oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent structural and functional action pathways. Signal and target characteristics determine biological outcome, which is optimal (or even positive) only within a given set of parameters.\nThis study was a perspective and nonsystematic literature mini-review.\nStudies support what we describe as a paradigm shift or \"quantum leap\" in the understanding and use of light and its interaction with water and other relevant photo-cceptors to restore physiologic function.\nBased on existing evidence, it is argued that PBM therapy can raise the standard of care and improve the quality of life of patients for a fraction of the cost of many current approaches. PBM therapy can, therefore,benefit large, vulnerable population groups, including the elderly and the poor, whilehaving a major impact on medical practice and public finances.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032ff","authors":["Santana-BlankLuis","Santana-Blank, Luis","Rodr\u00edguez-Santana, Elizabeth","Santana-Rodr\u00edguez, Karin E","Reyes, Heberto","Luis Santana-Blank","Elizabeth Rodr\u00edguez-Santana","Karin E.
