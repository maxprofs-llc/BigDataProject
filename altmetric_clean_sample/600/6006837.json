However, an allergic reaction and blurred vision caused by a transient myopic change were noted after she received Relenza treatment. Relenza-induced acute transient myopia had never been reported. The possible mechanisms include (1) ciliary spasm, (2) lens edema, (3) ciliary body and\/or choroidal effusion. Fortunately, the drug-induced myopic change mostly resolved spontaneously after discontinuation of the drug and had a benign course.\nPatients suspected of having drug-induced myopia should be examined by an internist for a systemic allergic reaction and referred to an optometrist or an ophthalmologist for further special examinations such as A-scan, B-scan, and ultrasound biomicroscopy. Optometrists and ophthalmologists should keep in mind and be aware of the possible ocular side effect (myopic change) of Relenza and warn patients of this potential condition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083e1","authors":["Weng, Tzu-Heng","Lin, Shih-Min","Pao, Sui-I","Chiang, Shang-Yi"],"doi":"10.1097\/opx.0000000000000766","first_seen_on":"2016-02-26T07:39:07+00:00","issns":["1538-9235","1040-5488"],"issue":"3","journal":"Optometry and Vision Science","last_mentioned_on":1456559543,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/optvissci\/Abstract\/2016\/03000\/Relenza_Induced_Acute_Myopia_Change.15.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/optvissci\/2016\/03000\/Relenza_Induced_Acute_Myopia_Change.15.pdf","pmid":"26641023","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"307","subjects":["optometry"],"title":"Relenza-Induced Acute Myopia Change","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/optvissci\/Fulltext\/2016\/03000\/Relenza_Induced_Acute_Myopia_Change.15.aspx","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relenzainduced-acute-myopia-change"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7295661,"mean":6.3692208345751,"rank":5251524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1787627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7295661,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282448,"mean":10.485361154482,"rank":182038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":84377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282448,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1195,"mean":5.1753869346734,"rank":697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1195,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":9.6437666666667,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HargraveEye\/statuses\/703121909026717696","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6006837],"posted_on":"2016-02-26T07:38:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Hargrave Eye Center","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hargraveeyecenter","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/458688906616004608\/2t7LIZGj_normal.jpeg","description":"The Hargrave Eye Center is a well respected, full-service ophthalmic center at the Methodist Dallas Medical Center operated by Dr. Sylvia Hargrave.","id_on_source":"HargraveEye","tweeter_id":"2458541456","geo":{"lt":32.78306,"ln":-96.80667,"country":"US"},"followers":1302},"tweet_id":"703121909026717696"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/statuses\/703487830681624576","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6006837],"posted_on":"2016-02-27T07:52:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
