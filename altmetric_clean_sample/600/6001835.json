Clinical translation of MSC-based approaches requires in vitro culture-expansion to achieve a sufficient number of cells. The ideal cell culture medium should be devoid of any animal derived components. We have evaluated whether human Platelet Lysate (hPL) could be an attractive alternative to animal supplements.\nMSCs from bone marrow (BMSCs) and adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) obtained from three donors were culture expanded in three different commercially available hPL fulfilling good manufacturing practice criteria for clinical use. BMSCs and ASCs cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle-alpha supplemented with 5% PLT-Max (Mill Creek), Stemulate\u2122 PL-S and Stemulate\u2122 PL-SP (COOK General Biotechnology) were compared to standard culture conditions with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cell morphology, proliferation, phenotype, genomic stability, and differentiation potential were analyzed.\nRegardless of manufacturer, BMSCs and ASCs cultured in hPL media showed a significant increase in proliferation capacity compared to FBS medium. In general, the immunophenotype of both BMSCs and ASCs fulfilled International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) criteria after hPL media expansion. Comparative genomic hybridization measurements demonstrated no unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements for BMSCs or ASCs cultured in hPL media or FBS medium. The BMSCs and ASCs could differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic, or chondrogenic lineages in all four culture conditions.\nAll three clinically approved commercial human platelet lysates accelerated proliferation of BMSCs and ASCs and the cells meet the ISCT mesenchymal phenotypic requirements without exhibiting chromosomal aberrations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f610004587","authors":["Morten Juhl"],"doi":"10.3109\/00365513.2015.1099723","endpage":"104","first_seen_on":"2016-02-25T06:56:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1502-7686","0036-5513"],"issue":"2","journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Clinical & Laboratory Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1456374480,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/00365513.2015.1099723"],"pmid":"26878874","pubdate":"2016-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"93","subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Comparison of clinical grade human platelet lysates for cultivation of mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow and adipose tissue","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-clinical-grade-human-platelet-lysates-cultivation-mesenchymal-stromal-cells-bone-marrow-a-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.88,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.88},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7282696,"mean":6.3665264114418,"rank":1172719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6109482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7282696,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282564,"mean":10.453327236758,"rank":62570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":219981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282564,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252,"mean":4.7344462151394,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
