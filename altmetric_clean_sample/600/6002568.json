At present, Schmideberg is solely remembered for having harshly attacked her mother at the start of the Controversial Discussions of the British Psycho-Analytical Society and for having coined the fitting expression \"stable instability\" in order to describe borderline and asocial personality disorders. However, the author discusses how the early groundbreaking discoveries of Klein with regards to primitive anxieties were the result of the joint work and thinking of Melanie and Melitta. Moreover, he argues that the conflict between the two, along with the subsequent polarization of their views, did not facilitate the development of psychoanalysis, neither did it help the analytic community to recognize the value of Melitta's contributions to psychoanalysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002217","authors":["Gabriele Cassullo"],"doi":"10.1057\/ajp.2015.57","first_seen_on":"2016-02-25T10:18:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-6741"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Psychoanalysis","last_mentioned_on":1456397533,"links":["http:\/\/www.palgrave-journals.com\/ajp\/journal\/v76\/n1\/full\/ajp201557a.html"],"pmid":"26912243","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"THE PSYCHOANALYTIC CONTRIBUTIONS OF MELITTA SCHMIDEBERG KLEIN.
