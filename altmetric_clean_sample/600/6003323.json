The underlying algorithms comprise multiple manual steps, whereas the few existing implementations typically restrict the user to a very limited set of molecular descriptors.\nWe present Structuprint, a free standalone software that fully automates the rendering of protein surface maps, given\u00a0- at the very least - a directory with a PDB file and an amino acid property. The tool comes with a default database of 328 descriptors, which can be extended or substituted by user-provided ones. The core algorithm comprises the generation of a mould of the protein surface, which is subsequently converted to a sphere and mapped to two dimensions, using the Miller cylindrical projection. Structuprint is partly optimized for multicore computers, making the rendering of animations of entire molecular dynamics simulations feasible.\nStructuprint is an efficient application, implementing a molecular cartography algorithm for protein surfaces. According to the results of a benchmark, its memory requirements and execution time are reasonable, allowing it to run even on low-end personal computers. We believe that it will be of use\u00a0- primarily but not exclusively - to structural biologists and computational biochemists.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000799","authors":["Dimitrios Georgios Kontopoulos","Dimitrios Vlachakis","Georgia Tsiliki","Sofia Kossida"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12900-016-0055-7","first_seen_on":"2016-02-25T14:22:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6807"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Structural Biology","last_mentioned_on":1470406811,"links":["http:\/\/bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12900-016-0055-7?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12900-016-0055-7","https:\/\/bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12900-016-0055-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12900-016-0055-7?site=http:\/\/bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"26911476","pubdate":"2016-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Crystallography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Mass Spectrometry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Protein Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Spectroscopy\/Spectrometry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Structuprint: a scalable and extensible tool for two-dimensional representation of protein surfaces","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/erratum-structuprint-scalable-extensible-tool-twodimensional-representation-protein-surfaces"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":4093465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3868560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288109,"mean":10.770754710039,"rank":144677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":132576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288109,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":2.6581830985915,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.9,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
