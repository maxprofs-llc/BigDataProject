Exclusion criteria were the patient's refusal and inadequate laboratory tests. The final study population consisted of 182 patients.\nNT-proBNP was assessed once during the perioperative period and later if clinically indicated, and troponin T (TnT) and ECG recordings were evaluated repeatedly. The short-term (30-day) and long-term (1000\u2005days) mortalities were studied.\nMedian (IQR) follow-up time was 3.1 (0.3) years. The median (IQR) NT-proBNP level was 1260 (2298) ng\/L in preoperative and 1600 (3971) ng\/L in postoperative samples (p=0.001). TnT was elevated in 66 (36%) patients, and was significantly more common in patients with higher NT-proBNP. Patients with high (>2370\u2005ng\/L) and intermediate (806-2370\u2005ng\/L) NT-proBNP level had significantly higher short-term mortality compared with patients having a low (<806\u2005ng\/L) NT-proBNP level (15 vs 11 vs 2%, p=0.04), and the long-term mortality remained higher in these patients (69% vs 49% vs 27%, p<0.001). Intermediate or high NT-proBNP level (HR 7.8, 95% CI 1.03 to 59.14, p<0.05) was the only independent predictor of short-term mortality, while intermediate or high NT-proBNP level (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.96, p=0.004), the presence of dementia (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.66, p=0.01) and higher preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) classification (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.38, p=0.02) were independent predictors of long-term mortality.\nAn elevated perioperative NT-proBNP level is common in hip fracture patients, and it is an independent predictor of short-term and long-term mortality superior to the commonly used clinical risk scores.\nNCT01015105; Results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Nordling, Pauliina","Kiviniemi, Tuomas","Strandberg, Marjatta","Strandberg, Niko","Airaksinen, Juhani"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2015-009416","first_seen_on":"2016-02-26T13:10:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"2","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1456492090,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26911583?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26911583","pubdate":"2016-02-26T22:01:30+00:00","title":"Predicting the outcome of hip fracture patients by using N-terminal fragment of pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predicting-outcome-hip-fracture-patients-using-nterminal-fragment-probtype-natriuretic-peptide-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289383,"mean":6.3680766857843,"rank":5501973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289383,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282431,"mean":10.484739949722,"rank":198010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282431,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5003,"mean":16.804105957617,"rank":4287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5003,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":363,"mean":13.694817679558,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":363,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
