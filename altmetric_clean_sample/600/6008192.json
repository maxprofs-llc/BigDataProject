Central to this field is the high-throughput DNA sequencing of genomes and metagenomes. The role of clinicogenomics in infectious disease diagnostics and public health microbiology was the topic of discussion during a recent symposium (session 161) presented at the 115(th) general meeting of the American Society for Microbiology held this past Spring in New Orleans, LA, USA. What follows is a collection of the most salient and promising aspects from each presentation at the symposium.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Westblade, Lars F","van Belkum, Alex","Grundhoff, Adam","Weinstock, George M","Pamer, Eric G","Pallen, Mark J","Dunne, Wm Michael","Lars F.
