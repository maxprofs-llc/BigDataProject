This process is also used extensively in biomedical applications to deliver nanoparticles (NPs) to diseased cells. The internalization of these nano-objects is controlled by the assembly of a clathrin-containing protein coat on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, which drives the invagination of the membrane and the formation of a cargo-containing endocytic vesicle. Current theoretical models of receptor-mediated endocytosis of viruses and NPs do not explicitly take coat assembly into consideration. In this paper we study cellular uptake of viruses and NPs with a focus on coat assembly. We characterize the internalization process by the mean time between the binding of a particle to the membrane and its entry into the cell. Using a coarse-grained model which maps the stochastic dynamics of coat formation onto a one-dimensional random walk, we derive an analytical formula for this quantity. A study of the dependence of the mean internalization time on NP size shows that there is an upper bound above which this time becomes extremely large, and an optimal size at which it attains a minimum. Our estimates of these sizes compare well with experimental data. We also study the sensitivity of the obtained results on coat parameters to identify factors which significantly affect the internalization kinetics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008512","authors":["Anand Banerjee","Alexander Berezhkovskii","Ralph Nossal"],"doi":"10.1088\/1478-3975\/13\/1\/016005","first_seen_on":"2016-02-26T14:40:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1478-3975"],"issue":"1","journal":"Physical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1456497080,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1478-3975\/13\/1\/016005","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1088\/1478-3975\/13\/1\/016005"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1478-3975\/13\/1\/016005\/pdf","pmid":"26871680","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"016005","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Kinetics of cellular uptake of viruses and nanoparticles via clathrin-mediated endocytosis","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kinetics-cellular-uptake-viruses-nanoparticles-via-clathrinmediated-endocytosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289383,"mean":6.3680766857843,"rank":5501978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289383,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282431,"mean":10.484755351768,"rank":198009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282431,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213,"mean":5.6180849056604,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.15,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
