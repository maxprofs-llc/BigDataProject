The resulting NiCo2 O4 possesses a distinct flower or sheet morphology, tuned by potential or current variation electrodeposition, which are used as binder-free lithium-ion battery anodes for the first time. Both samples exhibit high lithium storage capacity, profiting from the unique binder-free electrode structures. The flower-type NiCo2 O4 demonstrates high reversible discharge capacity (1459\u2005mAh\u2009g(-1) at 200\u2005mA\u2009g(-1) ) and excellent cyclability with around 71\u2009% retention of the reversible capacity after 60 cycles, which are superior to the sheet-type NiCo2 O4 . Such superb performance can be attributed to high volume utilization efficiency with unique morphological character, a well-preserved connection between the active materials and the current collector, a short lithium-ion diffusion path, and fast electrolyte transfer in the binder-free NiCo2 O4 -coated 3D graphene structure. The simple preparation process and easily controllable morphology make the binder-free NiCo2 O4 \/3D-GNF hybrid a potential material for commercial applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Zhang, Chunfei","Yu, Jong\u2010Sung","Yu, Jong-Sung"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201504386","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-02-26T10:41:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"13","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1457227740,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/chem.201504386","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201504386\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/chem.201504386"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201504386\/pdf","pmid":"26918287","pubdate":"2016-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Morphology\u2010Tuned Synthesis of NiCo2O4\u2010Coated 3D Graphene Architectures Used as Binder\u2010Free Electrodes for Lithium\u2010Ion Batteries","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/morphologytuned-synthesis-nico2o4coated-3d-graphene-architectures-used-binderfree-electrodes-lithium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7356005,"mean":6.3917145915054,"rank":685042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6669280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7356005,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282659,"mean":10.492697868095,"rank":39424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":243113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282659,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5041,"mean":3.0677571428571,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":4790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5041,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":3.8523279742765,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
