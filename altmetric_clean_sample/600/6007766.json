In the present study, we investigated the effects of co-treatment with an additional Bcl-xL inhibitor, Z36. Treatment with Z36 induced cell death in leukemia cell lines, with MT-4 cells exhibiting the lowest sensitivity to Z36. Co-treatment of cells with Z36 and CuD resulted in a greater degree of cell death for Hut78 and Jurkat cells than treatment with CuD alone. In contrast, co-treatment of MT-4 cells with Z36 and CuD had a suppressive effect on cell death. The autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) suppressed the growth of leukemia cell lines HuT78, Jurkat, MT-1, and MT-4. CuD-induced cell death was enhanced by 3-MA in Jurkat cells, but inhibited in MT-4 cells. Western blotting results revealed cleavage of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP), supporting CuD-induced cell death; 3-MA enhanced CuD-Z36-induced PARP cleavage. Taken together, our results indicate that autophagy negatively regulates chemical-induced cell death of leukemia cells, and that controlling autophagy could be beneficial in the development of more effective chemotherapies against leukemia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f61000812e","authors":["Nakanishi, Tsukasa","Song, Yuan","He, Cuiying","Wang, Duo","Morita, Kentaro","Tsukada, Junichi","Kanazawa, Tamotsu","Yoshida, Yasuhiro"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12032-016-0743-y","first_seen_on":"2016-02-26T11:14:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-131X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Medical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1456485095,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26913856?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26913856","pubdate":"2016-02-26T22:00:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Autophagy is associated with cucurbitacin D-induced apoptosis in human T cell leukemia cells","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autophagy-associated-cucurbitacin-dinduced-apoptosis-human-t-cell-leukemia-cells-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289383,"mean":6.3680766857843,"rank":5501934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289383,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282431,"mean":10.484601862408,"rank":197992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282431,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":492,"mean":1.3886639511202,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":492,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.00625,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AutophagyPapers\/statuses\/703175570939465729","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6007766],"posted_on":"2016-02-26T11:11:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Autophagy Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559405603697590273\/EoGNUIXe_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for #Autophagy papers.
