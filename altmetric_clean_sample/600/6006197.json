Nitrogen oxide cycle regulates nitric oxide levels and bacterial cell signaling : Scientific Reports","#nitric oxide cycling in streptomyces #nitrate reductase #nitrogen #microbiology"],"citation":{"abstract":"Nitric oxide (NO) signaling controls various metabolic pathways in bacteria and higher eukaryotes. Cellular enzymes synthesize and detoxify NO; however, a mechanism that controls its cellular homeostasis has not been identified. Here, we found a nitrogen oxide cycle involving nitrate reductase (Nar) and the NO dioxygenase flavohemoglobin (Fhb), that facilitate inter-conversion of nitrate, nitrite, and NO in the actinobacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. This cycle regulates cellular NO levels, bacterial antibiotic production, and morphological differentiation. NO down-regulates Nar and up-regulates Fhb gene expression via the NO-dependent transcriptional factors DevSR and NsrR, respectively, which are involved in the auto-regulation mechanism of intracellular NO levels. Nitrite generated by the NO cycles induces gene expression in neighboring cells, indicating an additional role of the cycle as a producer of a transmittable inter-cellular communication molecule.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yasuyuki Sasaki","Haruka Oguchi","Takuya Kobayashi","Shinichiro Kusama","Ryo Sugiura","Kenta Moriya","Takuya Hirata","Yuriya Yukioka","Naoki Takaya","Shunsuke Yajima","Shinsaku Ito","Kiyoshi Okada","Kanju Ohsawa","Haruo Ikeda","Hideaki Takano","Kenji Ueda","Hirofumi Shoun","Sasaki, Yasuyuki","Oguchi, Haruka","Kobayashi, Takuya","Kusama, Shinichiro","Sugiura, Ryo","Moriya, Kenta","Hirata, Takuya","Yukioka, Yuriya","Takaya, Naoki","Yajima, Shunsuke","Ito, Shinsaku","Okada, Kiyoshi","Ohsawa, Kanju","Ikeda, Haruo","Takano, Hideaki","Ueda, Kenji","Shoun, Hirofumi"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep22038","first_seen_on":"2016-02-26T02:22:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1479686400,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep22038","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26912114?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26912114","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep22038"],"pmid":"26912114","pubdate":"2016-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Hormone receptors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Applied microbiology","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"22038","subjects":["science"],"title":"Nitrogen oxide cycle regulates nitric oxide levels and bacterial cell signaling","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nitrogen-oxide-cycle-regulates-nitric-oxide-levels-bacterial-cell-signaling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059538,"mean":6.8397725663364,"rank":1610029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6440123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059538,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287549,"mean":10.763890585224,"rank":71808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":215273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287549,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32644,"mean":14.978538798517,"rank":9398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":23182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32644,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3030,"mean":16.45497986134,"rank":940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":2084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3030,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
