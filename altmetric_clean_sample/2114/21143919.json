The pathogenesis of liver fibrosis caused by viruses and alcohol has been well characterized, but the molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis induced by the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis are poorly understood. Lysophospholipase A (LysoPLA), which deacylates lysophospholipids, plays a critical role in mediating the virulence and pathogenesis of parasites and fungi; however, the roles of C. sinensis lysophospholipase A (CsLysoPLA) in C. sinensis-induced liver fibrosis remain unknown.\nA mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) was cultured and treated with CsLysoPLA. IL-25 and members of its associated signaling pathway were detected by performing quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. A human hepatic stellate cell line (LX-2) was cultured and exposed to IL-25. LX-2 cell activation markers were examined via quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. Migration was analyzed in transwell plates.\nTreating RAW264.7 cells with CsLysoPLA significantly induced IL-25 expression. Elevated PKA, B-Raf, and ERK1\/2 mRNA levels and phosphorylated B-Raf and ERK1\/2 were detected in CsLysoPLA-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The PKA inhibitor H-89 weakened B-Raf and ERK1\/2 phosphorylation whereas the AKT activator SC79 attenuated ERK1\/2 phosphorylation in RAW264.7 cells. Both H-89 and SC79 inhibited CsLysoPLA-induced IL-25 upregulation. In addition, stimulation of LX-2 cells with IL-25 upregulated the expression of mesenchymal cell markers, including \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and collagen type I (Collagen-I), and promoted cell migration.\nCsLysoPLA activates HSCs by upregulating IL-25 in macrophages through the PKA-dependent B-Raf\/ERK1\/2 pathway and potentially promotes hepatic fibrosis during C. sinensis infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000883","authors":["Lina Zhou","Mengchen Shi","Lu Zhao","Zhipeng Lin","Zeli Tang","Hengchang Sun","Tingjin Chen","Zhiyue Lv","Jin Xu","Yan Huang","Xinbing Yu","Zhou, Lina","Shi, Mengchen","Zhao, Lu","Lin, Zhipeng","Tang, Zeli","Sun, Hengchang","Chen, Tingjin","Lv, Zhiyue","Xu, Jin","Huang, Yan","Yu, Xinbing"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13071-017-2228-z","first_seen_on":"2017-06-17T19:30:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1756-3305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasites & Vectors","last_mentioned_on":1497869230,"links":["https:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13071-017-2228-z?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28623940?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13071-017-2228-z?site=parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28623940","pubdate":"2017-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"295","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"\n            Clonorchis sinensis lysophospholipase A upregulates IL-25 expression in macrophages as a potential pathway to liver fibrosis","type":"article","volume":"10"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":6368766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1138043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238011,"mean":12.813979210957,"rank":168817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238011,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2322,"mean":3.7371426109436,"rank":1649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2322,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":4.8197481481481,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bugbittentweets\/statuses\/876160062728699904","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21143919],"posted_on":"2017-06-17T19:30:11+00:00","author":{"name":"bugbitten","url":"http:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/598482198031966208\/UgmFEdxp_normal.jpg","description":"Official Twitter account for open access @BioMedCentral journal Parasites & Vectors and its official blog BugBitten","id_on_source":"bugbittentweets","tweeter_id":"1735651082","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1594},"tweet_id":"876160062728699904"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/statuses\/876753215722635264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21143919],"posted_on":"2017-06-19T10:47:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
