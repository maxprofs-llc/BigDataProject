Vitamin D deficiency is important in the development of bone barriers that prevent the complication of acute rhinosinusitis. Although Vitamin D levels may be a variable risk factor for various respiratory tract disorders, there are limited data on the role in sinonasal infections. Our aim was to investigate the association of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) levels with acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) and preseptal cellulitis complications. The type of the study is prospective case-control study. Fifteen patients in the pediatric age group with ARS-induced preseptal cellulitis complication were identified as Group 1, fifteen patients with ARS and without complication were identified as Group 2, and fifteen healthy volunteers were identified as Group 3. Serum 25OHD levels (nmol\/l) were measured in addition to routine blood tests at the first admission of patients participating in the study. Statistical analysis was performed between groups. The ages of the cases ranged from 1 to 14\u00a0years with a mean of 5.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.42\u00a0years. 55.6% of the cases (n\u00a0=\u00a025) were male; 44.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a020) were female children. As a result of classification in which vitamin D levels were compared with normal values, there was a statistically significant difference according to the presence of ARS (Group-1 and Group 2) and absence of ARS (Group-3) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). A statistically significant difference was also found between Group 1 and Group-3 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Statistically significant difference between Group 1 and Group 3 suggests that lack of vitamin D predisposes to the complication of preseptal cellulitis. Comparison of Group 1 and 2 with Group 3 (normal subjects) suggests that Vit D has a protective effect against developing sinusitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002814","authors":["Mustafa Suphi Elbistanl\u0131","Hasan Emre Ko\u00e7ak","Sel\u00e7uk G\u00fcne\u015f","Harun Ac\u0131payam","Baver Ma\u015fallah \u015eim\u015fek","Sinan Canpolat","Fatma T\u00fclin Kayhan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00405-017-4635-3","first_seen_on":"2017-06-18T07:27:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0937-4477","1434-4726"],"journal":"European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology","last_mentioned_on":1497623526,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28608241","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00405-017-4635-3","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s00405-017-4635-3"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00405-017-4635-3.pdf","pmid":"28608241","pubdate":"2017-06-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Vit D deficiency is a possible risk factor in ARS","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":7244369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237292,"mean":12.836509020569,"rank":193959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237292,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1356,"mean":1.5938258302583,"rank":1058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1356,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.71206896551724,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Vit D deficiency is a possible risk factor in ARS. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1359735254122884&id=275443519218735","license":"public","citation_ids":[21149019,21149019],"posted_on":"2017-06-16T14:32:06+00:00","summary":"Runny nose?
