In this study, we retrospectively reviewed our cases of posttransplant chylous ascites (PTCA) and aimed to propose a diagnostic and management protocol.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 96 LT recipients who underwent LT at our department. The incidence of PTCA and the associated risk factors were analyzed and our protocol for chylous ascites was evaluated.\nPTCA occurred in 6 (6.3%) patients (mean age: 10.7\u00b111.0years) at a mean of 10.8\u00b13.6days after LT. The primary disease in all of PTCA cases was biliary atresia (BA). The periportal lymphadnopathy was an independent risk factor for PTCA. In all cases PTCA successfully resolved according to our protocol. Octreotide was administered in 4 of our 6 PTCA cases. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 40.2\u00b18.4days, which was similar to that of cases without PTCA.\nThe incidence of PTCA in LT patients, especially in those with BA, is relatively high. Our diagnostic criteria and our management protocol were helpful for patients with refractory ascites after LT.\nDiagnostic test: Level II. Treatment study: Level III.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd6","authors":["Toshiharu Matsuura","Yusuke Yanagi","Makoto Hayashida","Yoshiaki Takahashi","Koichiro Yoshimaru","Tomoaki Taguchi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpedsurg.2017.06.004","first_seen_on":"2017-06-17T17:20:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00223468","1531-5037"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Surgery (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1497657859,"links":["http:\/\/www.jpedsurg.org\/article\/S0022-3468(17)30359-7\/fulltext?rss=yes","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jpedsurg.2017.06.004"],"pmid":"28625694","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pediatrics"],"title":"The incidence of chylous ascites after liver transplantation and the proposal of a diagnostic and management protocol","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incidence-chylous-ascites-after-liver-transplantation-proposal-diagnostic-management-protocol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":7249274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237654,"mean":12.803299373456,"rank":194243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237654,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2060,"mean":2.1525973773677,"rank":1436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2060,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":1.3013698630137,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
