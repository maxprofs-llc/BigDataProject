The purpose of this study was to three-dimensionally quantify the decrease in postsurgical nasal edema following rhinoplasty over the first postoperative year.\nThis was a retrospective, three-dimensional, morphometric study of primary, open rhinoplasty patients. Subjects with at least three postoperative three-dimensional images up to 1 year were included. Patients were excluded for closed or secondary procedures or cleft deformities. Images were assessed using three-dimensional stereophotogrammetry (Vectra) and volumetric analysis (Geomagic). Baseline nasal volume (time 0) occurred at the first postoperative visit at 1 to 2 weeks. All subsequent nasal volume measurements were calculated as a percentage of baseline values. Data points from all patients were pooled, and a six-point moving average was used to create an inverse function line of best fit.\nForty patients were included, with 146 three-dimensional photographs quantified. The equation for the inverse function line of best fit of the six-point moving average was y = 1.484 (1\/x) + 0.844 (R = 0.85, p < 0.01). According to this equation, approximately two-thirds of edema resolves within the first month, 95 percent after 6 months, and 97.5 percent after 1 year. A plateau is reached at 84.4 percent of the original postoperative volume.\nThis study provides quantitative evidence to predict decrement of rhinoplasty edema with time. Three-dimensional morphometric assessment demonstrated a two-thirds decrease in edema at 1 month, a 95 percent decrease at 6 months, and a 97.5 percent decrease at 1 year.\nTherapeutic, IV.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f61000854c","authors":["Pavri, Sabrina","Zhu, Victor Z.","Steinbacher, Derek M."],"doi":"10.1097\/prs.0000000000002760","endpage":"979e","first_seen_on":"2016-12-05T08:27:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1529-4242","0032-1052"],"issue":"6","journal":"Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1480926432,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/plasreconsurg\/Abstract\/2016\/12000\/Postoperative_Edema_Resolution_following.9.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/plasreconsurg\/2016\/12000\/Postoperative_Edema_Resolution_following.9.pdf","pmid":"27879585","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"973e","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Postoperative Edema Resolution following Rhinoplasty","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/plasreconsurg\/Fulltext\/2016\/12000\/Postoperative_Edema_Resolution_following.9.aspx","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postoperative-edema-resolution-following-rhinoplasty"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7849747,"mean":6.6509658923939,"rank":6799103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7849747,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250737,"mean":12.303215764788,"rank":203806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250737,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5013,"mean":7.1487693535515,"rank":4111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5013,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":41.914758064516,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
