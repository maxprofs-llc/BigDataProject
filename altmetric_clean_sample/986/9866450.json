In parallel, it has gained general acceptance that cancer is considered as complex adaptive system, which evolves responding environmental selective pressures. This somatic evolution appears to proceed concurrently with the acquisition of an atavistic pluripotent state (i.e., \"stemness\"), which is inducible by intrinsic epigenetic reprogramming program as demonstrated by induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. This Nobel prize-winning discovery has markedly accelerated and expanded cancer stem cell research from the point of epigenetic reprogramming. Taken together, we hypothesize that stress-triggered atavistic reprogramming (STAR) may be the major driving force of HNSCC evolution. In this perspective, we discuss the possible mechanisms of STAR in HNSCC, focusing on recent topics of epigenetic reprogramming in developmental and cancer cell biology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbc1","authors":["Masuda, Muneyuki","Wakasaki, Takahiro","Toh, Satoshi"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-19T22:43:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2156-6976"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1469455063,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27429838?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27429838?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27429838"],"pmcid":"PMC4937727","pmid":"27429838","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Stress-triggered atavistic reprogramming (STAR) addiction: driving force behind head and neck cancer?","type":"article","volume":"6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":3361133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4670684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258001,"mean":11.98278964341,"rank":99095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":156208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258001,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294,"mean":1.6163139931741,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Brianxbio\/statuses\/755531819483668481","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9866450],"posted_on":"2016-07-19T22:36:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Ho","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Brianxbio","tweeter_id":"215282928","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":54},"tweet_id":"755531819483668481"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/755536215042949121","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9866450],"posted_on":"2016-07-19T22:54:05+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
