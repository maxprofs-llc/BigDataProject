Recently four genes were found constituently over-expressed in herbicide resistant individuals of Lolium rigidum, a close relative of Lolium multiflorum. These include two cytochrome P450s, one nitronate monooxygenase and one glycosyl-transferase. Higher expressions of these four herbicide metabolism related (HMR) genes were also observed after herbicides exposure in the gene expression databases, indicating them as reliable markers. In order to get an overview of herbicidal resistance status of L. multiflorum L, 19 field populations were collected. Among these populations, four populations were found to be resistant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors while three exhibited resistance to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors in our initial screening and dose response study. The genotyping showed the presence of mutations Trp-574-Leu and Ile-2041-Asn in ALS and ACCase, respectively, and qPCR experiments revealed the enhanced expression of HMR genes in individuals of certain resistant populations. Moreover, co-expression networks and promoter analyses of HMR genes in O. sativa and A. thaliana resulted in the identification of a cis-regulatory motif and zinc finger transcription factors. The identified transcription factors were highly expressed similar to HMR genes in response to xenobiotics whereas the identified motif is known to play a vital role in coping with environmental stresses and maintaining genome stability. Overall, our findings provide an important step forward toward a better understanding of metabolism-based herbicide resistance that can be utilized to devise novel strategies of weed management.","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b456f","authors":["Mahmood, Khalid","Mathiasen, Solvejg Kopp","Kristensen, Michael","Kudsk, Per","Mathiassen, Solvejg K.","Mathiassen, Solvejg K"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpls.2016.01160","first_seen_on":"2016-07-19T19:06:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-462X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Plant Science","last_mentioned_on":1471948412,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpls.2016.01160\/abstract","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpls.2016.01160\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27547209?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpls.2016.01160\/pdf","pmid":"27547209","pubdate":"2016-07-19T20:16:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Multiple herbicide resistance in Lolium multiflorum and identification of conserved regulatory elements of herbicide resistance genes","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-herbicide-resistance-lolium-multiflorum-identification-conserved-regulatory-elements-herbic-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":3363482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4844237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259659,"mean":12.01873663049,"rank":94770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":162692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259659,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5684,"mean":2.6077737110681,"rank":1179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":4450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5684,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":2.893592,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
