TMX-SLNs were prepared by solvent emulsification-diffusion method and optimized for maximum drug loading using rotatable central composite design. The optimized TMX-SLNs were stabilized using 10% w\/w trehalose as cryoprotectant. In addition, pharmacokinetics and hepatotoxicity of freeze-dried TMX-SLNs were also evaluated in Sprague Dawley rats.\nInitial characterization with transmission electron microscopy revealed spherical morphology with smooth surface having an average particle size of 261.08 \u00b1 2.13 nm. The observed entrapment efficiency was 40.73 \u00b1 2.83%. In-vitro release study showed TMX release was slow and pH dependent. Pharmacokinetic study revealed a 1.59-fold increase in relative bioavailability as compared to TMX suspension. A decrease in hepatotoxicity of TMX is evidenced by the histopathological evaluation of liver tissues.\n\u03b1-lipoic acid-stearylamine conjugate-based SLNs have a great potential in enhancing the oral bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs like TMX. Moreover, this ALA-SA nanoparticulate system could be of significant value in long-term anticancer therapy with least side effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb9","authors":["Dhaundiyal, Ankit","Jena, Sunil K.","Samal, Sanjaya K.","Sonvane, Bhavin","Chand, Mahesh","Sangamwar, Abhay T."],"doi":"10.1111\/jphp.12644","first_seen_on":"2016-10-28T07:20:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2042-7158"],"journal":"Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1477639200,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jphp.12644\/abstract?campaign=wolsavedsearch&utm_content=buffer8c51e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jphp.12644\/pdf","pmid":"27709612","pubdate":"2016-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacy","pharmacology"],"title":"Alpha-lipoic acid-stearylamine conjugate-based solid lipid nanoparticles for tamoxifen delivery: formulation, optimization, in-vivo pharmacokinetic and hepatotoxicity study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alphalipoic-acidstearylamine-conjugatebased-solid-lipid-nanoparticles-tamoxifen-delivery-formulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":6587188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235245,"mean":12.683762221353,"rank":191673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235245,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":683,"mean":2.6438768328446,"rank":559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":683,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.1153846153846,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
