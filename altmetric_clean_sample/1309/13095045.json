To put the mortal risk with ECT in proper perspective, it is only necessary to note that ECT is about 10 times safer than childbirth, that approximately 6 times as many deaths annually in the U.S. are caused by lightning as by ECT, that two complications of psychotropic drug therapy in younger women-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage-virtually never occur with ECT, and that the death rate reported for ECT is an order of magnitude smaller than the spontaneous death rate in the general population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa91f3cf058f61000d654","authors":["Abrams, R"],"first_seen_on":"2016-10-28T12:50:20+00:00","issns":["0749-8055"],"issue":"3","journal":"Convulsive therapy","last_mentioned_on":1477659003,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9342128"],"pmid":"9342128","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"The mortality rate with ECT.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mortality-rate-ect"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":3933702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2132544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235246,"mean":12.683621160917,"rank":128983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235246,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Physics and Astronomy":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CCThetanR\/statuses\/791985378244825089","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13095045],"posted_on":"2016-10-28T12:50:03+00:00","author":{"name":"CCTR Theo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/756428059671162880\/u2pUPl_9_normal.jpg","description":"Citizens Commission on Thetan Rights, established in 2016 by Theo the persecuted Body Thetan to help point out how silly people can be!","id_on_source":"CCThetanR","tweeter_id":"745589178096848896","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":22},"tweet_id":"791985378244825089"}]}}
