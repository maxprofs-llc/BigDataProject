Despite increasing evidence that binge drinking is associated with impairments in executive aspects of working memory (i.e. self-ordered working memory), processes known to depend on the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 46 and 9), less is known about the impact of binge drinking on prefrontal gray matter integrity. Here, we investigated the effects of binge drinking on gray matter volume of mid- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in youths. We used voxel-based morphometry on the structural magnetic resonance images of subjects reporting a persistent (at least three years) binge drinking pattern of alcohol use (n = 11; age 22.43 \u00b1 1.03) and control subjects (n = 21; age 22.18 \u00b1 1.08) to measure differences in gray matter volume between both groups. In a region of interest analysis of the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, after co-varying for age and gender, we observed significantly larger gray matter volume in the left mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 46 and 9) in binge drinkers in comparison with control subjects. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between left mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume and Self-Ordered Pointing Test (SOPT) total errors score in binge drinkers. The left mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume also correlated with the quantity and speed of alcohol intake. These findings indicate that a repeated exposure to alcohol -that does not meet criteria for alcohol dependence- throughout post-adolescent years and young adulthood is linked with structural anomalies in mid-dorsolateral prefrontal regions critically involved in executive aspects of working memory.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sonia Doallo","Fernando Cadaveira","Montserrat Corral","Nayara Mota","Eduardo L\u00f3pez-Caneda","Socorro Rodr\u00edguez Holgu\u00edn"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0096380","first_seen_on":"2014-05-23T14:53:20+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1400856790,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0096380"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0096380.pdf","pmid":"24789323","pubdate":"2014-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e96380","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Larger Mid-Dorsolateral Prefrontal Gray Matter Volume in Young Binge Drinkers Revealed by Voxel-Based Morphometry","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/larger-middorsolateral-prefrontal-gray-matter-volume-young-binge-drinkers-revealed-voxelbased-morpho"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3802105,"mean":5.0134586051273,"rank":2123882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":975635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3802105,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94587,"mean":7.4794940688897,"rank":49670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94587,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67450,"mean":8.2635082803303,"rank":37901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":20052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67450,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2869,"mean":10.797509065551,"rank":1777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2869,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
