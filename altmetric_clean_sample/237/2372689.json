Indeed, theoretical and experimental analyses indicate that the diffusive resistance of the spine neck is sufficient to effectively compartmentalize some signaling molecules in a spine for the duration of their activated lifetime. Here we describe the application of 2-photon microscopy combined with stimulated emission depletion (STED-2P) to the biophysical study of the relationship between synaptic signals and spine morphology, demonstrating the utility of combining STED-2P with modern optical and electrophysiological techniques. Morphological determinants of fluorescence recovery time were identified and evaluated within the context of a simple compartmental model describing diffusive transfer between spine and dendrite. Correlations between the neck geometry and the amplitude of synaptic potentials and calcium transients evoked by 2-photon glutamate uncaging were also investigated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc13","authors":["Kevin Takasaki","Bernardo L Sabatini"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnana.2014.00029","first_seen_on":"2014-05-23T10:15:35+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1662-5129"],"journal":"Frontiers in Neuroanatomy","last_mentioned_on":1404200524,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24847215?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fnana.2014.00029\/abstract"],"pmid":"24847215","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Super-resolution 2-photon microscopy reveals that the morphology of each dendritic spine correlates with diffusive but not synaptic properties","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/superresolution-2photon-microscopy-reveals-morphology-each-dendritic-spine-correlates-diffusive-not"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2904971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1448429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106077,"mean":7.7684372525362,"rank":68152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":34607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106077,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290,"mean":4.552892733564,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":16.7686,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":29,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
