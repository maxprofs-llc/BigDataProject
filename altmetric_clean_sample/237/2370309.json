Seventy-seven patients were included. Time to complete healing was significantly shorter in the treatment groups compared with the controls (P = 0.044 and P = 0.003, respectively). Secondary infections occurred more often in the controls (P = 0.00014). Ointments containing antibiotics are recommended for application at the early stage of patent Guinea worm infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006990","authors":["P Magnussen","A Yakubu","P Bloch"],"first_seen_on":"2014-05-22T04:41:12+00:00","issns":["0002-9637"],"issue":"6","journal":"The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1400739179,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7810814"],"pmid":"7810814","pubdate":"1994-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"The effect of antibiotic- and hydrocortisone-containing ointments in preventing secondary infections in guinea worm disease.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-antibiotic-hydrocortisonecontaining-ointments-preventing-secondary-infections-guinea-worm-dis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6630849,"mean":6.1457572186808,"rank":4661884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1725317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6630849,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147385,"mean":7.7751774955222,"rank":91908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":49395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147385,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2084,"mean":5.6981334613538,"rank":1438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2084,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":7.1519452054795,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
