The endocannabinoid system (ECS) modulates neurotransmission and neuronal plasticity and is important for cognitive functioning. Evidence points to the involvement of this neuromodulatory system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and that alteration of the ECS on peripheral lymphocytes could reflect central changes. The objective of this study was to compare levels of peripheral endocannabinoid receptor expression in patients with schizophrenia and healthy subjects and find evidence of association between peripheral expression of those receptors and cognitive performance. Patients with stabilized schizophrenia (N=53) and controls (N=22) underwent clinical and cognitive evaluation, and assessment of cannabinoid receptor expression on the surface of peripheral immune cells (lymphocytes, natural killer cells and monocytes) by flow cytometry. Patients with schizophrenia had lower levels of cannabinoid receptor expression on total T lymphocytes, but after controlling for possible confounders this difference did not remain significant. In patients, increased cannabinoid receptor expression on lymphocytes and monocytes was significantly correlated with worst cognitive performance. These data provide additional evidence of the involvement of the ECS in the pathophysiology of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034cc","authors":["Rodrigo Ferretjans","Salvina Maria de Campos","Rafael Ribeiro-Santos","Fernanda Carneiro Guimar\u00e3es","Keliane de Oliveira","Ana Cec\u00edlia Alves Cardoso","Marcio Sobreira Ara\u00fajo","Andrea Teixeira-Carvalho","Olindo Assis Martins-Filho","Antonio L Teixeira","Jo\u00e3o V Salgado"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.schres.2014.04.028","first_seen_on":"2014-05-24T10:18:14+00:00","issns":["1573-2509"],"journal":"Schizophrenia Research","last_mentioned_on":1400926252,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24853061?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24853061","pubdate":"2014-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Cognitive performance and peripheral endocannabinoid system receptor expression in schizophrenia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cognitive-performance-peripheral-endocannabinoid-system-receptor-expression-schizophrenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4199933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123018,"mean":7.9627451490447,"rank":99505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123018,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1966,"mean":4.0610157760814,"rank":1770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1966,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":3.0896279069767,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
