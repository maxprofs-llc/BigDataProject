The effect of SL on breast cancer metastasis, however, is unknown. Cell migration and invasion are crucial in neoplastic metastasis. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which degrades the extracellular matrix, is a major component in cancer cell invasion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b0","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6882-14-170","first_seen_on":"2014-05-25T08:37:23+00:00","issns":["1472-6882"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1401006407,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6882\/14\/170\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6882-14-170.pdf","pmid":"24885456","pubdate":"2014-05-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"170","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Saussurea lappa extract suppresses TPA-induced cell invasion via inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent MMP-9 expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/saussurea-lappa-extract-suppresses-tpainduced-cell-invasion-via-inhibition-nf%CE%BAbdependent-mmp9-expres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3806383,"mean":5.0156659367543,"rank":2885737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":755087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3806383,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94627,"mean":7.4947755162431,"rank":71423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94627,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1269,"mean":4.8986466876972,"rank":1046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1269,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.6637586206897,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
