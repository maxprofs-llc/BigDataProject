Surgery is the traditional treatment of CD strictures. However, due the chronicity of the inflammatory process and the associated fibrosis, postoperative recurrence occurs frequently. The lack of specific drug to treat fibrotic strictures and their irreversible nature has drawn the attention to less invasive and bowel-sparing therapeutic modalities. Endoluminal therapies may provide effective option in relieving symptoms associated with CD complications and reduce the need for repeated surgery with substantial clinical benefit. This review will discuss the current use and efficacy of the endoscopic treatment of CD complications. New endoscopic modalities and recent advances will be also evaluated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d1","authors":["Andrea Buda","Patrick I Okolo"],"doi":"10.1586\/17474124.2014.919850","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2014-05-24T10:37:43+00:00","issns":["1747-4124","1747-4132"],"journal":"Expert Review of Gastroenterology and Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1400927845,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/17474124.2014.919850"],"pmid":"24849124","pubdate":"2014-05-21T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Endoscopic treatment of Crohn's complications.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endoscopic-treatment-crohns-complications-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":3344568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1484986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123086,"mean":7.9532800259987,"rank":76735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":41268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123086,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318,"mean":1.478214511041,"rank":139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.6913793103448,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ERJournals\/status\/469111166082379778","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2376166],"posted_on":"2014-05-21T13:43:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Expert Reviews","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/page\/ExpertReviews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000496751182\/2258702d67dd42cedd317fb79fc5212a_normal.jpeg","description":"Expert Reviews is a leading series of 16 journals providing commentary and analysis on modern healthcare","id_on_source":"ERJournals","tweeter_id":"1886949961","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1279},"tweet_id":"469111166082379778"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CPalmerEO\/status\/470151574753644544","license":"datasift","rt":["ERJournals"],"citation_ids":[2376166],"posted_on":"2014-05-24T10:37:25+00:00","author":{"name":"C Palmer","url":"http:\/\/mindtorch.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/745448366075686912\/UYOvX_c7_normal.jpg","description":"Healthcare Consultancy","id_on_source":"CPalmerEO","tweeter_id":"2540707743","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":779},"tweet_id":"470151574753644544"}]}}
