Data were collated based on postcode of residence of the animal and the corresponding landscape (landcover and elevation) and climate (precipitation, temperature) information was derived. During the study period (October 2010-December 2012), a total of 5560 cases (4235 [76%] canine and 1325 [24%] feline cases) were reported from 341 postcodes, mostly along the eastern seaboard of Australia and from the states of New South Wales and Queensland. Significantly more cases were reported from postcodes which contained areas of broadleaved, evergreen tree coverage (P=0.0019); broadleaved, deciduous open tree coverage (P=0.0416); and water bodies (P=0.0394). Significantly fewer tick paralysis cases were reported from postcodes which contained areas of sparse herbaceous or sparse shrub coverage (P=0.0297) and areas that were cultivated and managed (P=0.0005). No significant (P=0.6998) correlation between number of tick paralysis cases reported per postcode and elevation was found. Strong positive correlations were found between number of cases reported per postcode and the annual minimum (rSP=0.9552, P<0.0001) and maximum (rSP=0.9075; P=0.0001) precipitation. Correlations between reported tick paralysis cases and temperature variables were much weaker than for precipitation, rSP<0.23. For maximum temperature, the strongest correlation between cases was found in winter (rSP=0.1877; P=0.0005) and for minimum temperature in autumn (rSP=0.2289: P<0.0001). Study findings suggest that tick paralysis cases are more likely to occur and be reported in certain eco-climatic zones, such as those with higher rainfall and containing tree cover and areas of water. Veterinarians and pet owners in these zones should be particularly alert for tick paralysis cases to maximize the benefits of early treatment, and to be vigilant to use chemical prophylaxis to reduce the risk of tick parasitism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fd","doi":"10.1016\/j.vetpar.2014.05.018","first_seen_on":"2014-05-26T10:51:22+00:00","issns":["03044017"],"journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1402293126,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0304401714002970","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24893694"],"pmid":"24893694","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"The association between landscape and climate and reported tick paralysis cases in dogs and cats in Australia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-landscape-climate-reported-tick-paralysis-cases-dogs-cats-australia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":2285533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1640324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":36},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106139,"mean":7.7891832708364,"rank":51573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":40348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106139,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1267,"mean":1.7918104265403,"rank":561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1267,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":2.9452,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
