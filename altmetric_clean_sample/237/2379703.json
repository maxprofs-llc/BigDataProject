The continuous growth in the number and size of urban areas along with an increasing demand on resources and energy poses great challenges for ensuring human welfare in cities while preventing an increasing loss of biodiversity. The understanding of how urban ecosystems function, provide goods and services for urban dwellers; and how they change and what allows and limits their performance can add to the understanding of ecosystem change and governance in general in an ever more human-dominated world. This Special Issue aims at bridging the knowledge gap among urbanization, demand creation, and provisioning of ecosystem services in urban regions on the one hand and schemes of urban governance and planning on the other.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51a3cf058f61000387f","authors":["Dagmar Haase","Niki Frantzeskaki","Thomas Elmqvist"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13280-014-0503-1","first_seen_on":"2014-05-26T17:18:31+00:00","issns":["1654-7209","0044-7447"],"issue":"4","journal":"AMBIO - A Journal of the Human Environment","last_mentioned_on":1500392187,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s13280-014-0503-1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s13280-014-0503-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs13280-014-0503-1.pdf","pmid":"24740613","pubdate":"2014-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Atmospheric Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Engineering\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Management","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physical Geography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Ecosystem Services in Urban Landscapes: Practical Applications and Governance Implications","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ecosystem-services-urban-landscapes-practical-applications-governance-implications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229472,"mean":6.9710874477773,"rank":1949375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6242926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229472,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176724,"mean":7.4655257663125,"rank":43212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":132645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176724,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":626,"mean":7.0473696,"rank":257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":626,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":7.11,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":35,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
