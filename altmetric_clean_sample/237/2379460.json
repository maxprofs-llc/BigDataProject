The risk factors and etiological mechanisms are still being investigated. Occupational exposure to various chemical and biological agents may induce specific sensitization and\/or irritant effects. The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence of work-related symptoms suggesting the presence of allergic disease reported by cleaners, and to relate them to the results of commercially available and standardized objective tests used for screening detection of occupational sensitization and chronic respiratory disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b84","authors":["Lipi\u0144ska-Ojrzanowska A","Wiszniewska M","Swierczy\u0144ska-Machura D","Wittczak T","Nowakowska-\u015awirta E","Pa\u0142czy\u0144ski C","Walusiak-Skorupa J"],"doi":"10.2478\/s13382-014-0272-x","first_seen_on":"2014-05-26T14:37:45+00:00","issns":["1232-1087"],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Occupational Medicine & Environmental Health (Instytut Medycyny Pracy im.
