We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive, adult IHHD patients and kidney transplant recipients between 2000 and 2011 at a large Canadian tertiary care center. The primary outcome was time-to-treatment failure or death for IHHD patients compared with expanded criteria, standard criteria, and living donor recipients, and secondary outcomes included hospitalization rate. Treatment failure was defined as a permanent switch to an alternative dialysis modality for IHHD patients, and graft failure for transplant recipients. The cohort comprised 173 IHHD patients and 202 expanded criteria, 642 standard criteria, and 673 living donor recipients. There were 285 events in the primary analysis. Transplant recipients had a reduced risk of treatment failure\/death compared with IHHD patients, with relative hazards of 0.45 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.31 to 0.67) for living donor recipients, 0.39 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.59) for standard criteria donor recipients, and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.67) for expanded criteria donor recipients. IHHD patients had a lower hospitalization rate in the first year of treatment compared with standard criteria donor recipients and in the first 3 months of treatment compared with living donor and expanded criteria donor recipients. In this cohort, kidney transplantation was associated with superior treatment and patient survival, but higher early rates of hospitalization, compared with IHHD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e9c","authors":["Tennankore KK","Kim SJ","Baer HJ","Chan CT"],"doi":"10.1681\/asn.2013111180","first_seen_on":"2014-05-26T01:06:11+00:00","issns":["1046-6673","1533-3450"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1401673938,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24854268","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1681\/ASN.2013111180","http:\/\/jasn.asnjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/05\/20\/ASN.2013111180.abstract"],"pmid":"24854268","pubdate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Survival and Hospitalization for Intensive Home Hemodialysis Compared with Kidney Transplantation","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survival-hospitalization-intensive-home-hemodialysis-compared-kidney-transplantation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":89.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":89.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7951584,"mean":6.7165931168612,"rank":87128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7864680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7951584,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174993,"mean":7.2704885366191,"rank":2393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":172599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174993,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2439,"mean":10.00646923708,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":2402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2439,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":12.97552173913,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
