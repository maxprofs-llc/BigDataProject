The skeleton contributes to glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity via osteocalcin (OC) in its undercarboxylated (ucOC) form in mice. We tested the hypothesis that insulin sensitivity over the hours after exercise is associated with circulating levels of ucOC. Eleven middle-aged (58.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 years mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM), obese (body mass index [BMI]\u2009=\u200933.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u2009kg\/m(2) ) nondiabetic men completed a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp at rest (rest-control) and at 60 minutes after exercise (4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 minutes of cycling at 95% of HRpeak ). Insulin sensitivity was determined by glucose infusion rate relative to body mass (GIR, mL\/kg\/min) as well as GIR per unit of insulin (M-value). Blood samples and five muscle biopsies were obtained; two at the resting-control session, one before and one after clamping, and three in the exercise session, at rest, 60 minutes after exercise, and after the clamp. Exercise increased serum ucOC (6.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.013) but not total OC (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Blood glucose was \u223c6% lower and insulin sensitivity was \u223c35% higher after exercise compared with control (both p\u2009<\u20090.05). Phosphorylated (P)-AKT (Ak thymoma) was higher after exercise and insulin compared with exercise alone (no insulin) and insulin alone (no exercise, all p\u2009<\u20090.05). In a multiple-linear regression including BMI, age, and aerobic fitness, ucOC was associated with whole-body insulin sensitivity at rest (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.59, p\u2009=\u20090.023) and after exercise (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.66, p\u2009=\u20090.005). Insulin sensitivity, after acute exercise, is associated with circulating levels of ucOC in obese men. Whether ucOC has a direct effect on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity after exercise is yet to be determined. \u00a9 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007ba6","authors":["Levinger I","Jerums G","Stepto NK","Parker L","Serpiello FR","McConell GK","Anderson M","Hare DL","Byrnes E","Ebeling PR","Seeman E","Levinger, Itamar","Jerums, George","Stepto, Nigel K","Parker, Lewan","Serpiello, Fabio R","McConell, Glenn K","Anderson, Mitchell","Hare, David L","Byrnes, Elizabeth","Ebeling, Peter R","Seeman, Ego","Itamar Levinger","George Jerums","Nigel K Stepto","Lewan Parker","Fabio R Serpiello","Glenn K McConell","Mitchell Anderson","David L Hare","Elizabeth Byrnes","Peter R Ebeling","Ego Seeman"],"doi":"10.1002\/jbmr.2285","endpage":"2576","first_seen_on":"2014-05-26T09:30:23+00:00","handle":"11343\/44032","handles":["11343\/44032"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1523-4681","0884-0431","08840431"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Bone & Mineral Research","last_mentioned_on":1401552308,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbmr.2285\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/jbmr.2285"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbmr.2285\/pdf","pmid":"24861730","pubdate":"2014-05-23T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2571","subjects":["metabolism","orthopedics"],"title":"The Effect of Acute Exercise on Undercarboxylated Osteocalcin and Insulin Sensitivity in Obese Men","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/jbmr.2285","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-acute-exercise-undercarboxylated-osteocalcin-insulin-sensitivity-obese-men"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6336890,"mean":5.977453696917,"rank":2593774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3602176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6336890,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144826,"mean":7.650154117038,"rank":58701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":81551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144826,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1251,"mean":5.880096,"rank":536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1251,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.7568571428571,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
