Albumin proteomics kit"],"citation":{"abstract":"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a toxicant commonly present in many food products. Conventionally, immuno-affinity analysis is applied to rapidly screen the presence of OTA in food. However, antibodies are expensive. In this study, we present a new approach for selectively enriching OTA from aqueous samples using human serum albumin (HSA) bound magnetic beads as the affinity probes, followed by the analysis of CE\/ESI-MS. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of using the affinity probes to concentrate OTA, we also propose a rapid concentration and elution method for extraction, that is, OTA are extracted from aqueous samples by pipetting the samples in and out of a sample vial for 1 min followed by elution with pipetting for another minute. On the basis of the magnetic property, the affinity magnetic probe-target species could be rapidly isolated from the solution during the process of extraction and elution by magnetic separation. CE\/ESI-MS, coupled by the electrodeless\/sheathless interface, is used for the analysis of the samples. As this method features speed and cost-effectiveness, it is suitable for the purpose of rapid screening. In fact, the lowest detection limit for OTA is approximately 4 x 10(-3) mg\/L.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["Hong CY","Chen YC"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chroma.2007.05.026","first_seen_on":"2014-05-23T13:07:22+00:00","issns":["00219673"],"journal":"Journal of Chromatography A","last_mentioned_on":1400850334,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021967307008837"],"pmid":"17537446","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Selective enrichment of ochratoxin A using human serum albumin bound magnetic beads as the concentrating probes for capillary electrophoresis\/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometric analysis ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selective-enrichment-ochratoxin-using-human-serum-albumin-bound-magnetic-beads-concentrating-probes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":3096730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":973327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106069,"mean":7.7553266395144,"rank":73022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106069,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1978,"mean":1.5377137076378,"rank":848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1978,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":4.6842857142857,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
