The current immunological assay of choice is an immunoblot that detects antibodies to a 31 kDa protein present in crude extracts of the female worm. Recently we have identified diagnostic targets from excretion and secretion products and determined the composition of the 31 kDa antigen after 2-D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Here we cloned and expressed five proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Recombinant proteins were purified and analysed by Western blot assays and among them 14-3-3, Lec5 and ES7 were recognized by Angiostrongylus-specific serum, although the signal was weak.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Morassutti AL","Perelygin A","Levert K","Lin SC","Lee YM","da Silva AJ","Wilkins PP","Graeff-Teixeira C"],"first_seen_on":"2014-05-24T08:04:51+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6 Suppl 2","journal":"Hawaii J Med Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1400918684,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23900614?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23900614","pubdate":"2013-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine","publichealth"],"title":"Expression of Recombinant Antigenic Proteins from Angiostrongylus cantonensis: A Brief Report.","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-recombinant-antigenic-proteins-angiostrongylus-cantonensis-brief-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
