In mammalian cells, it is excised by the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) during DNA base-excision repair, and the generated free 8-oxoG base is one of the DNA-derived biomarkers of oxidative stress in biological samples. The modification of 8-oxoG in the context of nucleoside and DNA has been the subject of many studies; however, the oxidative transformation of the free 8-oxoG base has not been described. By using biochemical and cell biological assays, we show that in the presence of molecular oxygen, the free 8-oxoG base transforms to a highly reactive hydroperoxide (8-oxoG*). Specifically, 8-oxoG* oxidizes Amplex red to resorufin, H(2)DCF to DCF, Fe(2+) to Fe(3+), and GSH to GSSG. This property of 8-oxoG* was diminished by treatment with catalase and glutathione peroxidase, but not superoxide dismutase. 8-OxoG* formation was prevented by reducing agents or nitrogen atmosphere. Its addition to CM-H(2)DCF-DA-loaded cells rapidly increased intracellular DCF fluorescence. There were no such properties observed for 8-oxodeoxyguanosine, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine, 2'-deoxyguanosine, guanine, adenine, guanosine, and 8-hydroxyadenine. These data imply that a free 8-oxoG base is more susceptible to oxidation than is its nucleoside form and, consequently, it stands as unique among intact and oxidatively modified purines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002911","authors":["Hajas G","Bacsi A","Aguilerra-Aguirre L","German P","Radak Z","Sur S","Hazra TK","Boldogh I","Gyorgy Hajas","Attila Bacsi","Leopoldo Aguilerra-Aguirre","Peter German","Zsolt Radak","Sanjiv Sur","Tapas K.
