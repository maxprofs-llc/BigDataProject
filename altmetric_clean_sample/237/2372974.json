Epidemiological findings support a relationship between pre-eclampsia and the failure of tolerance induction. For induction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-specific tolerance, long-term exposure to seminal fluid, which contains paternal soluble MHC class I antigens, may induce paternal MHC class I-specific tolerance. Furthermore, soluble HLA-G1, which induces the deletion of CD8(+) T-cells, and the combination of maternal killer-immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on NK cells and fetal HLA-C, which affects the balance between inhibition and activation signals of NK cells, regulatory CD8(+) T cells, and regulatory NK cells, may play very important roles in the induction of MHC class I-specific tolerance. On the other hand, exposure to sperm, which express paternal HLA-DR, and trophoblastic debris, which contain intracellular fetal HLA-DR, may induce paternal MHC class II-specific tolerance. In this process, CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg)-cells play central roles. In this review, we discuss the relationship between the risk of pre-eclampsia and tolerance induction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f03","authors":["Shigeru Saito","Masatoshi Sakai","Yasushi Sasaki","Akitoshi Nakashima","Arihiro Shiozaki"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jri.2007.08.002","first_seen_on":"2014-05-23T10:49:03+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0165-0378"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Journal of Reproductive Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1400831416,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17935792"],"pmid":"17935792","pubdate":"2007-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Inadequate tolerance induction may induce pre-eclampsia.","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inadequate-tolerance-induction-induce-preeclampsia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3802184,"mean":5.0139933085773,"rank":3047551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3802184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94588,"mean":7.4787238626873,"rank":75386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94588,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":3.498776119403,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.6928571428571,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
