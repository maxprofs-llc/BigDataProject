The single strongest risk factor for gastric cancer is Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastric inflammation. Among persons with H. pylori infection, strain-specific components, host immune responses, and environmental factors influence the risk for gastric disease, including adenocarcinoma of the stomach, although only a small proportion of infected persons develop the malignancy. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have uncovered a complex community of noncultivatable inhabitants of the human stomach. The interaction between these inhabitants, collectively referred to as the gastric microbiota, and H. pylori likely affects gastric immunobiology and possibly the sequelae of H. pylori infection. Thus, characterization of the gastric microbiota in subjects with and without H. pylori infection could provide new insight into gastric homeostasis and the pathogenesis of H. pylori-associated disease, including gastric cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057c7","authors":["Kyle M Brawner","Casey D Morrow","Phillip D Smith","Brawner KM","Morrow CD","Smith PD"],"doi":"10.1097\/ppo.0000000000000043","endpage":"216","first_seen_on":"2014-05-25T02:26:34+00:00","funders":["niaid","niams","nci"],"issns":["1540-336X","1528-9117"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cancer Journal","last_mentioned_on":1412782565,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24855010?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalppo\/Abstract\/2014\/05000\/Gastric_Microbiome_and_Gastric_Cancer.9.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24855010"],"pmid":"24855010","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"211","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Gastric microbiome and gastric cancer.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gastric-microbiome-gastric-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4771101,"mean":5.7217804170968,"rank":1129769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3630199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4771101,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114242,"mean":8.0437446275857,"rank":30780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":83102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114242,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":359,"mean":1.7908547486034,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":359,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":6.55,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
