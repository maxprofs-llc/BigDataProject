The extensive field surveys carried out in the Kashmir Himalaya at five study sites resulted in the collection and identification of 76 potential ectomycorrhizal fungal species associated with the Cedrus deodara and Pinus wallichiana. Maximum 32 number of species were found associated with Pinus wallichiana, 19 with Cedrus deodara and 25 species were found growing in association with both the conifers. The present study reveals that Cedrus deodara and Pinus wallichiana in the Kashmir Himalaya, India harbour diverse ectomycorrhizal fungal species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f610004384","authors":["Itoo ZA","Reshi ZA"],"first_seen_on":"2014-05-23T10:55:29+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Pakistan Journal of Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1400842494,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24783775?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24783775","pubdate":"2014-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Ectomycorrhizal diversity associated with Cedrus deodara and Pinus wallichiana in the Kashmir Himalaya, India.","type":"article","volume":"17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":3533686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":135085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106068,"mean":7.75485151838,"rank":81664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106068,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178,"mean":1.5911299435028,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.79545454545455,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/status\/469793589896048640","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2373017],"posted_on":"2014-05-23T10:54:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
