A total of 359 patients were randomized to enalapril 20\u00a0mg, lercanidipine 10\u00a0mg, or enalapril\/lercanidipine 20\/10\u00a0mg fixed combination. We evaluated blood pressure (BP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid profile, lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40\u00a0L), serum myeloperoxidase (MPO), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). We recorded a decrease of BP in all groups, with the enalapril\/lercanidipine combination being more effective in reducing BP compared with single monotherapies. Lipid profile or FPG were not affected by various treatments. Lercanidipine, but not enalapril, improved Lp(a) levels compared with baseline, with enalapril\/lercanidipine having a greater effect on Lp(a) reduction. All treatments increased sRAGE levels, and decreased sCD40\u00a0L and MPO, even if enalapril\/lercanidipine combination was more effective than single monotherapies. TNF-\u03b1 and Hs-CRP were greater reduced by enalapril\/lercanidipine combination compared with enalapril (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 for both). The enalapril\/lercanidipine fixed combination was more effective than single monotherapies in decreasing BP, but also in improving markers of cardiovascular risk stratification in hypertensive patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e9b","authors":["Derosa G","Bonaventura A","Romano D","Bianchi L","Fogari E","D'Angelo A","Maffioli P","Giuseppe Derosa","Aldo Bonaventura","Davide Romano","Lucio Bianchi","Elena Fogari","Angela D'Angelo","Pamela Maffioli"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jash.2014.03.329","endpage":"428","first_seen_on":"2014-05-24T11:39:19+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["19331711","1933-1711"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of the American Society of Hypertension","last_mentioned_on":1496161500,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24836352","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S193317111400446X","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jash.2014.03.329"],"pmid":"24836352","pubdate":"2014-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ireland Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"422","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"RETRACTED: Enalapril\/lercanidipine combination on markers of cardiovascular risk: a randomized study ","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enalaprillercanidipine-combination-markers-cardiovascular-risk-randomized-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.37,"score_history":{"1y":8.08,"6m":5.08,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.37},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":555814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7734466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176995,"mean":7.4716047210643,"rank":14455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":162539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176995,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276,"mean":3.9119636363636,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":7.84,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
