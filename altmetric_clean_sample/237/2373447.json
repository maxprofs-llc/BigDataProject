We previously found that DNA repair and homologous recombination (HR) factors localize to sites of HPV replication, suggesting ATM activity is required to recruit factors to viral genomes that can productively replicate viral DNA in a recombination-dependent manner. The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex is an essential component of the DDR that is necessary for ATM-mediated HR repair, and localizes to HPV DNA foci. In this study, we demonstrate that the HPV E7 protein is sufficient to increase levels of the MRN complex, and also interacts with MRN components. We have found that Nbs1 depletion blocks productive viral replication, and results in decreased localization of Mre11, Rad50, and the principal HR factor Rad51 to HPV DNA foci upon differentiation. Nbs1 contributes to the DDR by acting an upstream activator of ATM in response to double strand DNA breaks (DSB), and as a downstream effector of ATM activity in the intra-S phase checkpoint. We have found that phosphorylation of ATM and its downstream target Chk2, as well as SMC1 (structural maintenance of chromosome 1) is maintained upon Nbs1 knockdown in differentiating cells. Given that ATM and Chk2 are required for productive replication, our results suggest that Nbs1 contributes to viral replication outside of its role as an ATM activator, potentially through ensuring localization of DNA repair factors to viral genomes that are necessary for efficient productive replication.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Daniel C Anacker","Dipendra Gautam","Kenric A Gillespie","William H Chappell","Cary A Moody"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.00517-14","first_seen_on":"2014-05-23T11:45:48+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1098-5514"],"journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1400845520,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24850735?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24850735","pubdate":"2014-05-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Productive Replication of Human Papillomavirus 31 Requires the DNA Repair Factor Nbs1.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/productive-replication-human-papillomavirus-31-requires-dna-repair-factor-nbs1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":3096850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":973370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106068,"mean":7.7549844532231,"rank":73025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":24398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106068,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5119,"mean":3.0750187573271,"rank":3565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5119,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":2.3372608695652,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
