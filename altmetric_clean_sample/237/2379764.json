All previous studies demonstrating this seasonality were performed in European populations residing at latitudes upwards of 50\u00b0N. This study investigated whether seasonality of prognosis persists in populations residing in the lower latitudes of the contiguous United States (Latitude 21\u00b0N to 48\u00b0N).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd13","authors":["Ho A","Gabriel A","Bhatnagar A","Etienne D","Loukas M","Marios Loukas"],"doi":"10.12659\/msm.890062","first_seen_on":"2014-05-26T18:05:23+00:00","issns":["1234-1010","1643-3750"],"issue":"","journal":"Medical science monitor international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","last_mentioned_on":1487802628,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24835144","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4038642\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24835144"],"pmid":"24835144","pubdate":"2014-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Seasonality pattern of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer is dependent on latitude","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.medscimonit.com\/abstract\/index\/idArt\/890062","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seasonality-pattern-breast-colorectal-prostate-cancer-dependent-latitude"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":799607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7448358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176789,"mean":7.4677268592893,"rank":20068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":156554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176789,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1019,"mean":2.8055324165029,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1019,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.8714285714286,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
