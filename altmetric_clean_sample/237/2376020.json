Infected co-cultured cells were treated without or with sHLA-G neutralizing antibody. Uninfected co-cultured cells were used as controls. Apoptosis of dNK cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscope. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to determine caspase 3 and caspase 8 expression. sHLA-G in supernatant were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In infection groups, sHLA-G was increased, while dNK apoptosis proteins caspase 3 and caspase 8 were up-regulated, but significantly decreased in the presence of sHLA-G neutralizing antibody compared to controls. Under the situation of T. gondii-infected dNK cells co-cultured with trophoblast cells, the up-regulation of sHLA-G could induce dNK cells apoptosis which ultimately may contribute to the abnormal pregnancy outcomes with T. gondii infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ac7","authors":["Meiyu Han","Yuzhu Jiang","Kaixue Lao","Xiaoyan Xu","Shaowei Zhan","Yanlin Wang","Xuemei Hu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10753-014-9900-7","first_seen_on":"2014-05-24T10:13:21+00:00","issns":["1573-2576"],"journal":"Inflammation","last_mentioned_on":1400926253,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24854161?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24854161","pubdate":"2014-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pathology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"sHLA-G Involved in the Apoptosis of Decidual Natural Killer Cells Following Toxoplasma gondii Infection.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shlag-involved-apoptosis-decidual-natural-killer-cells-following-toxoplasma-gondii-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4199927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123018,"mean":7.9627451490447,"rank":99505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123018,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":358,"mean":1.3269691876751,"rank":188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":358,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.0041666666667,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
