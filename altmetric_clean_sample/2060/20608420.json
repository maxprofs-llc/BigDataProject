After the initial rehydration was achieved patients were offered traditional weaning foods. Treatment with oral rehydration solution continued until diarrhoea stopped. Accurate intake and output was maintained throughout the study period. Efficacy of the treatment was compared between the different treatment groups in terms of intake of the solution, stool output, duration of diarrhoea after admission, and weight gain after 24, 48, and 72 hours, and after resolution of diarrhoea. Results suggest that all the cereal based solutions were as effective as glucose based standard oral rehydration solution in the treatment of diarrhoea.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002302","authors":["P R Kenya","H W Odongo","G Oundo","K Waswa","J Muttunga","A M Molla","S K Nath","A Molla","W B Greenough","R Juma"],"doi":"10.1136\/adc.64.7.1032","first_seen_on":"2017-05-27T02:22:16+00:00","issns":["0003-9888","1468-2044"],"issue":"7","journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","last_mentioned_on":757382400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/adc.64.7.1032"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/archdischild\/64\/7\/1032.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1792691","pmid":"2629624","pubdate":"1989-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Cereal based oral rehydration solutions.","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cereal-based-oral-rehydration-solutions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7812625,"mean":6.6309954939539,"rank":1913127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4821910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7812625,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100129,"mean":11.129949224992,"rank":29504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":69729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100129,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3670,"mean":7.1939122376669,"rank":1289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3670,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":3.8588571428571,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
