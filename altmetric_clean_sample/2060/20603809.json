Their en face and profile photographs were taken in Natural Head Position. Photogrammetry included analysis of nine neoclassical canons of facial beauty originating from the Renaissance. Psychosocial issues were assessed using the Self-Esteem Scale, Big Five Inventory and three domains of Orthognathic Quality of Life Questionnaire.\nSignificant deviations from neoclassical facial beauty canons were observed in 55-65% of adolescents and young adults. Gender and age showed no relation to deviations. The deviations from canons that influenced the quality of life were mainly those related to vertical facial proportions and demonstrated increased facial aesthetics concern and social impact, and higher self-reported treatment need (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Deviations from canons were not related to self-esteem but a decrease in openness, agreeableness and neuroticism was observed.\nNeoclassical canons were not valid for the majority of adolescents and young adults in Croatia. Only deviations from some canons appear to provoke mild psychosocial repercussions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f62","authors":["Andrej Pavlic","Magda Trinajstic Zrinski","Visnja Katic","Stjepan Spalj"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcms.2017.01.029","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T22:59:57+00:00","issns":["10105182"],"journal":"Journal of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1495638069,"links":["http:\/\/www.jcmfs.com\/article\/S1010-5182(17)30040-9\/fulltext#.WSWgLUa4q3k.facebook"],"pmid":"28283341","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Neoclassical canons of facial beauty: Do we see the deviations?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neoclassical-canons-facial-beauty-we-see-deviations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":7144895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237723,"mean":12.083908111155,"rank":192816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237723,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":425,"mean":1.4494858490566,"rank":288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":425,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.51,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
