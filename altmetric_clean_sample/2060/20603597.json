It is a serine\/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of tumor progression and cell proliferation. In this study, the role of Dyrk1B in breast cancer development was investigated. The expression of Dyrk1B was detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry staining, both of which demonstrated that Dyrk1B was overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and cells. Statistical analysis showed that the extent of Dyrk1B expression was associated with multiple clinicopathologic factors, including tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor status, and Ki-67 expression, and that high expression predicted a poor prognosis. The growth of breast cancer cells was inhibited significantly after knockout of DYRK1B by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Moreover, FoxO1 could be phosphorylated by Dyrk1B, and then FoxO1 was shuttled from the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm, which might be the mechanism of Dyrk1B-mediated survival in breast cancer cells. The results suggest that Dyrk1B plays a key role in the progression of breast cancer and provides a new target for breast cancer therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007680","authors":["Chen, Yingying","Wang, Shuo","He, Zhixian","Sun, Fulan","Huang, Yeqing","Ni, Qichao","Wang, Hua","Wang, Yingying","Cheng, Chun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.humpath.2017.02.033","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T22:46:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00468177","1532-8392","0046-8177"],"journal":"Human Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1496226206,"links":["http:\/\/www.humanpathol.com\/article\/S0046-8177(17)30174-0\/fulltext?rss=yes","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28554575?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28554575","pubdate":"2017-05-31T10:23:41+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Dyrk1B overexpression is associated with breast cancer growth and a poor prognosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dyrk1b-overexpression-associated-breast-cancer-growth-poor-prognosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":4174490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3909307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239542,"mean":12.126297919771,"rank":120181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":109258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239542,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1414,"mean":4.031940552017,"rank":818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1414,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":6.3058823529412,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
