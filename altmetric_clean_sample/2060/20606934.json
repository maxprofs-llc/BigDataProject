Regression analysis showed that body bulk at various ages, as expressed by the BMI is closely related with the height attained at age 14, and longitudinal principal components analysis suggested that it is also associated with the whole growing process. The way in which BMI affects height could be related with the stage of sexual development, which seems to play an intermediate role in the pathway linking body bulk and height.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f610003215","authors":["Manuel Amador","Jorge Bacallao","Mirta
