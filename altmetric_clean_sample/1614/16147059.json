In this system, which contained detergent-activated virus and a cytoplasmic extract of mouse L-cells, three of the five viral proteins (N, NS, and M) were synthesized accurately and efficiently; a putative precursor to the viral glycoprotein (G) was also made, but synthesis of the L protein was not detected. In response to irradiation of VSV, the synthesis of each protein in the coupled system displayed a characteristic single-hit inhibition. This permitted calculation of the apparent target-sizes for expression of the different viral genes relative to the entire genome (3.6 to 4.0 X 10(6) daltons) as measured by loss of infectivity. These are: N, 0.55 X 10(6); NS, 0.83 X 10(6); M, 1.12 X 10(6); G, 1.76 X 10(6) daltons of RNA. Only the N protein gene has a target-size which corresponds to that predicted from the molecular weight of its messenger RNA (molecular weight: 0.55 X 10(6)). The target-sizes for the other three genes are two to four times larger than expected, and are not proportional to the molecular weights of their corresponding messenger RNAs (molecular weights: NS, 0.28 X 10(6); M, 0.28 X 10(6); G, 0.7 X 10(6)). The polar effect of UV irradiation is inconsistent with independent transcription of each of the genes of VSV. Rather, the target-sizes appear to be cumulative, suggesting that trnascription initiates at a single point on VSV RNA and proceeds in the order 3'-N-NS-M-G-(L)-5'.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["L A Ball","C N White"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-05T17:56:40+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"2","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1486314840,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC335925\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC335925\/pdf\/pnas00671-0180.pdf","pmcid":"PMC335925","pmid":"174107","pubdate":"1976-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"442","subjects":["science"],"title":"Order of transcription of genes of vesicular stomatitis virus.","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/order-transcription-genes-vesicular-stomatitis-virus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.008,"score_history":{"1y":7.008,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.008},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":1172130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6994534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262376,"mean":12.828490717484,"rank":57322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":205053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262376,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46189,"mean":23.913703949078,"rank":15923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":30257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46189,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1006,"mean":55.317110447761,"rank":528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1006,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
