Almost as soon as it aired, however, it generated controversy due to its extensive sexual themes and relatively explicit portrayal of sexual issues. To determine how safer sex, antistigma messages, and overall sexual content were integrated into Shuga, we conducted a content analysis. Results indicated that condom use and HIV destigmatization messages were frequently and clearly communicated. Negative consequences for risky sexual behavior were communicated over the course of the entire series. Messages about multiple concurrent partnerships were not evident. In addition, in terms of scenes per hour of programming, Shuga had 10.3 times the amount of sexual content overall, 8.2 times the amount of sexual talk, 17.8 times the amount of sexual behavior, and 9.4 times the amount of sexual intercourse as found in previous analysis of U.S. entertainment programming. Research is needed to determine how these factors may interact to influence adolescent viewers of entertainment education dramas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100014ed","authors":["Booker, Nancy Achieng'","Miller, Ann Neville","Ngure, Peter"],"doi":"10.1080\/10410236.2015.1077691","endpage":"1446","first_seen_on":"2016-08-06T17:30:48+00:00","issns":["1532-7027","1041-0236"],"issue":"12","journal":"Health Communication","last_mentioned_on":1472202007,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27054689"],"pmid":"27054689","pubdate":"2016-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Communication And Media Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"startpage":"1437","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","healthservices"],"title":"\n              Heavy Sexual Content Versus Safer Sex Content: A Content Analysis of the Entertainment Education Drama\n              Shuga\n            ","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heavy-sexual-content-versus-safer-sex-content-content-analysis-entertainment-education-drama-shuga"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":3549229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4697333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258880,"mean":12.002590847461,"rank":102448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":154564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258880,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":598,"mean":6.8224254606365,"rank":279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":598,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.91315,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
