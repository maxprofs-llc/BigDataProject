No function has been assigned to SraG. Multiple levels of post-transcriptional regulation have been demonstrated for the rpsO-pnp operon. Here we show that SraG is a new factor affecting pnp expression. SraG overexpression results in a reduction of pnp expression and a destabilization of pnp mRNA; in contrast, inhibition of SraG transcription results in a higher level of the pnp transcript. Furthermore, in vitro experiments indicate that SraG inhibits translation initiation of pnp Together, these observations demonstrate that SraG participates in the post-transcriptional control of pnp by a direct antisense interaction between SraG and PNPase RNAs. Our data reveal a new level of regulation in the expression of this major exoribonuclease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008844","authors":["Fanette Fontaine","Elise Gasiorowski","Celine Gracia","Mathieu Ballouche","Joel Caillet","Antonin Marchais","Eliane Hajnsdorf"],"doi":"10.1261\/rna.055236.115","endpage":"1573","first_seen_on":"2016-08-06T19:17:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-9001"],"issue":"10","journal":"RNA","last_mentioned_on":1475280000,"links":["http:\/\/rnajournal.cshlp.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/05\/rna.055236.115.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1261\/rna.055236.115"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rnajournal.cshlp.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/05\/rna.055236.115.full.pdf","pmid":"27495318","pubdate":"2016-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1560","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The small RNA SraG participates in PNPase homeostasis","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/small-rna-srag-participates-pnpase-homeostasis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":959808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7481787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260291,"mean":12.040066226132,"rank":42603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":216760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260291,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1749,"mean":4.5440629290618,"rank":302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1749,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":10.687142857143,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
