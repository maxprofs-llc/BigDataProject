To understand this issue, this paper integrates two prominent adoption theories-Human-Organization-Technology fit (HOT-fit) model and Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. Thirteen factors under four dimensions were investigated to explore their influence on HRIS adoption decisions in hospitals. Employing non-probability sampling method, a total of 550 copies of structured questionnaires were distributed among HR executives of 92 private hospitals in Bangladesh. Among the respondents, usable questionnaires were 383 that suggesting a valid response rate of 69.63%. We classify the sample into 3 core groups based on the HRIS initial implementation, namely adopters, prospectors, and laggards. The obtained results specify 5 most critical factors i.e. IT infrastructure, top management support, IT capabilities of staff, perceived cost, and competitive pressure. Moreover, the most significant dimension is technological dimension followed by organisational, human, and environmental among the proposed 4 dimensions. Lastly, the study found existence of significant differences in all factors across different adopting groups. The study results also expose constructive proposals to researchers, hospitals, and the government to enhance the likelihood of adopting HRIS. The present study has important implications in understanding HRIS implementation in developing countries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Md Golam Rabiul Alam","Abdul Kadar Muhammad Masum","Loo-See Beh","Choong Seon Hong"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0160366","first_seen_on":"2016-08-06T19:11:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1470510689,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0160366"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0160366.PDF","pmid":"27494334","pubdate":"2016-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0160366","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Critical Factors Influencing Decision to Adopt Human Resource Information System (HRIS) in Hospitals","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/critical-factors-influencing-decision-adopt-human-resource-information-system-hris-hospitals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":6206568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1100051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257394,"mean":12.007004712637,"rank":182654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":40045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257394,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113514,"mean":10.571312272603,"rank":82983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":17712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113514,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4372,"mean":10.382601692976,"rank":3408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4372,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
