Here we show that PCBP2 forms a complex with the Hippo pathway components Sav1, Mst1, Mst2 and Lats1 in human cells and mouse tissues. Hippo is a kinase cascade that functions to phosphorylate and inactivate the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ, which control cell growth and proliferation. PCBP2 specifically interacts with the scaffold protein, Sav1, and prevents proteolytic cleavage of the Mst1 kinase, resulting in increased signaling through Hippo and suppressed activity of YAP and TAZ. Human breast epithelial cells lacking PCBP2 exhibit impaired proteasomal degradation of TAZ. They accumulate TAZ in both the nucleus and the cytosol, increase expression of YAP and TAZ target genes CTGF and Cyr61, and exhibit anchorage-independent growth. Thus, PCBP2 can function as a component of the Hippo complex, enhancing signaling, suppressing activity of YAP and TAZ, and altering growth characteristics of cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Fengmin Li","Kimberly Z.
