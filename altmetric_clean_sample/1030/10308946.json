A celebratory party was held at the Formosa Fun Water Park in New Taipei City, Taiwan. At 20:32, the was an explosion caused by an overheated spotlight accidentally igniting colored cornstarch powder that had been sprayed on the stage. Factors associated with ED LOS were compared.\nIn total, 48 burn injury patients were enrolled for study analysis. The median total body surface area of second- to third-degree burns was 35.0% (interquartile range [IQR], 15.8%-55.0%). The median ED LOS was 121.5 minutes (IQR, 38.3-209.8 minutes). The output time interval accounted for the longest interval with a median time of 56.0 minutes (IQR, 15.3-117.3 minutes). In multivariate analysis of the variables, triage level (level III; hazard ratio, 0.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.52) and output time (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-0.98) were significant influential factors.\nThe triage level and output time intervals were significantly associated with ED LOS in a burn-related MCI. Time effectiveness analyses, using a patient flow model, might serve as an important indicator during a hospital MCI response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005704","authors":["Chen, Shou-Yen","Chaou, Chung-Hsien","Ng, Chip-Jin","Cheng, Ming-Huei","Hsiau, Ya-Wen","Kang, Shih-Ching","Hsu, Chih-Po","Weng, Yi-Ming","Chen, Jih-Chang","Shou-Yen Chen","Chung-Hsien Chaou","Chip-Jin Ng","Ming-Huei Cheng","Ya-Wen Hsiau","Shih-Ching Kang","Chih-Po Hsu","Yi-Ming Weng","Jih-Chang Chen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajem.2016.04.056","endpage":"1466","first_seen_on":"2016-08-07T00:55:49+00:00","issns":["1532-8171","07356757"],"issue":"8","journal":"American Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1490628663,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0735675716301061&_version=1&md5=c84ecb04037e8d371a14d9f1608f064b","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27210731"],"pmid":"27210731","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1462","subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Factors associated with ED length of stay during a mass casualty incident","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0735675716301061","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-associated-ed-length-stay-during-mass-casualty-incident"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":3625178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4760454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260098,"mean":12.04092303256,"rank":102711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":155538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260098,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2936,"mean":5.1373444633731,"rank":1331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2936,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":3.7646021505376,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":6,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":10,"Neuroscience":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"IN":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NWASLibrary\/statuses\/762089761066582016","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10308946],"posted_on":"2016-08-07T00:55:32+00:00","author":{"name":"NWASLibrary","url":"http:\/\/www.networks.nhs.uk\/nhs-networks\/nwas-library-and-information-service","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/602271582116061184\/FuIqklb6_normal.png","description":"North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust, Library & Knowledge Service [NWAS LKS].
