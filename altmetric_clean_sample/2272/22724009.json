First, a quantified model of the feedback phase demonstrates how the optical parameters of optical devices (including light source, polarizer, 45\u00b0 fusion point, Faraday rotator and half-wave plate) result in the nonlinearity of closed-loop OVSs. Then, the parameter indexes of different optical devices are put forward to instruct the manufacturing process of the optical system. Furthermore, a closed-loop control algorithm is investigated to improve the measurement accuracy of nonlinear OVSs considering the unideal parameters. The experiment results indicate that additional bias caused by undesirable optical parameters is obviously decreased so that the measurement accuracy of OVSs satisfies the demand of IEC60044-3 for 0.1 level measurement accuracy, which verifies the effectiveness and correctness of the methods for suppressing the impact of unideal optical parameters on OVSs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Wei Deng","Hui Li","Chunxi Zhang","Pengjie Wang"],"doi":"10.3390\/s17081723","first_seen_on":"2017-07-27T14:36:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"8","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1501166166,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/8\/1723?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/8\/1723\/pdf","pmid":"28749440","pubdate":"2017-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Optimization of Detection Accuracy of Closed-Loop Optical Voltage Sensors Based on Pockels Effect","type":"article","volume":"17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282957,"mean":6.9842712712639,"rank":6284119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1120215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282957,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171712,"mean":11.60763975517,"rank":121056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171712,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3414,"mean":1.9639372985643,"rank":1866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3414,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":1.6700819672131,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RamonElizaldeN\/statuses\/890581568019771393","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22724009],"posted_on":"2017-07-27T14:36:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Ramon Humberto","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/879108639642058752\/Z-OQgpTN_normal.jpg","description":"Hay una fuerza motriz m\u00e1s poderosa que el vapor, la electricidad y la energ\u00eda at\u00f3mica: la voluntad.\n@AlbertEinstein","id_on_source":"RamonElizaldeN","tweeter_id":"792248012651102208","geo":{"lt":29.0971,"ln":-110.95749,"country":"MX"},"followers":290},"tweet_id":"890581568019771393"}]}}
