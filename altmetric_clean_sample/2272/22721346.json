Fungi have cell walls that impede the efficient lysis of organisms and liberation of DNA, which can lead to false-negative PCR results. Conversely, some human pathogens are also ubiquitous environmental saprophytes that can contaminate PCR reagents and cause false-positive results. We examine the quality of PCR-based studies for fungal diagnostics using 42 variables within the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments guidelines. This review focuses on taxon-directed PCR assays for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, candidiasis and Pneumocystis pneumonia. Finally, we evaluate broad-range fungal PCR assays capable of detecting a wide spectrum of human pathogens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073ca","authors":["Prasanna D Khot","David N Fredricks"],"doi":"10.1586\/eri.09.104","first_seen_on":"2017-07-27T14:18:14+00:00","issns":["1478-7210","1744-8336"],"issue":"10","journal":"Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1501146000,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2845394\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2845394","pmid":"19968513","pubdate":"2009-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"1201","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"PCR-based diagnosis of human fungal infections","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pcrbased-diagnosis-human-fungal-infections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":5,"6m":5,"3m":5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":1641667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6605492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171713,"mean":11.607223898155,"rank":42199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":129304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171713,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":617,"mean":3.3785616883117,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":617,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.8816666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
