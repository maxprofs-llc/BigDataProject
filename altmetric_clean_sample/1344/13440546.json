Present study was carried out from June 2013 to December 2013, among the children (<15\u00a0years of age) of Kathmandu Valley. Stool samples were collected from total 600 children (350 from four public schools and slum areas of Kathmandu valley and 250 from pediatric department of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital). The main objectives of this study were to investigate the intestinal parasitic infections in children below 15\u00a0years of age and their risk factors. However, some bacterial pathogens were also investigated. The overall prevalence of parasitic infections was 29.5\u00a0%. The rate of parasitic infections in children from community (39.43\u00a0%) was higher than that from hospital (15.6\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Giardia lamblia was the most common protozoan found to be causing infections in children and among helminths Ascaris lumbricoides was the most common worm isolated. Higher rates of parasitic infections were found in children of illiterate parents (38.17\u00a0%), children using untreated drinking water (49.77\u00a0%) and children having habit of consuming raw vegetables (31.50\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The present study indicated that the rate of infections due to enteropathogenic parasites was high among children of Nepal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8113cf058f61000bb46","authors":["Sachita Dhital","Narayan Dutt Pant","Sanjeev Neupane","Saroj Khatiwada","Bijay Gaire","Jeevan Bahadur Sherchand","Padma Shrestha"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40064-016-3477-6","first_seen_on":"2016-11-08T13:56:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2193-1801"],"issue":"1","journal":"SpringerPlus","last_mentioned_on":1478697325,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5069229\/pdf\/40064_2016_Article_3477.pdf"],"pmid":"27812451","pubdate":"2016-11-08T20:16:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Prevalence of enteropathogens in children under 15\u00a0years of age with special reference to parasites in Kathmandu, Nepal; a cross sectional study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/springerplus.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s40064-016-3477-6","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-enteropathogens-children-under-15years-age-special-reference-parasites-kathmandu-nepal-cr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.4,"score_history":{"1y":5.4,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8066706,"mean":6.8442246947137,"rank":1452816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6609770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8066706,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237662,"mean":13.156981591426,"rank":61606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":175810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237662,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1718,"mean":3.2650238788585,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":1519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1718,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":2.4287407407407,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
