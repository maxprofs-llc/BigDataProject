The three-dimensional wave equation in cylindrical coordinates is investigated, as the theoretical solution in the exponential spiral horn is derived and in the case of the strings, numerical simulation mainly using a centered in time and space finite difference scheme is carried out. The results suggest non-harmonic resonance modes in both of the conical and exponential spiral strings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040f2","authors":["Rasoul Morteza Pouraghdam","Rasoul Morteza Pouraghdam","Rama B.
