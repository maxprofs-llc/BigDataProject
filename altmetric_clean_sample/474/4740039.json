When it occurs in childhood, it can cause secondary dentofacial deformities. This study described our experience in the simultaneous correction of TMJ ankylosis and secondary dentofacial deformities performed in a single operation.\nTwenty-seven patients with TMJ ankylosis and secondary deformities were treated in a single surgery from January 2009 to December 2013. Clinical outcomes were assessed based on the oral function, radiography, and medical photography.\nNo relapse (of TMJ ankylosis) occurred in any of the patients during the follow-up period. Oral function and skeletal deformities had (were) significantly improved in all the patients. Most of the patients were satisfied with the final outcome.\nOne-stage treatment permits the simultaneous correction of both the TMJ functional deficit and skeletal deformities in a single operation, which suggests that it is an effective approach for the treatment of patents with TMJ ankylosis and secondary dentofacial deformities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","authors":["Zhu, Songsong","Jiang, Yangmei","Pokhrel, Niraj","Hu, Jing"],"doi":"10.1097\/scs.0000000000002085","first_seen_on":"2015-11-09T10:09:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-3732","1049-2275"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1451400675,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Simultaneous_Correction_of_Temporomandibular_Joint.97882.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Abstract\/2015\/11000\/Simultaneous_Correction_of_Temporomandibular_Joint.28.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Simultaneous_Correction_of_Temporomandibular_Joint.97882.pdf","pmid":"26517460","pubdate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Simultaneous Correction of Temporomandibular Joint Ankylosis and Secondary Dentofacial Deformities in Adult Patients: Surgical Technique, Treatment Outcomes, and a Consideration of the Factors Involved","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simultaneous-correction-temporomandibular-joint-ankylosis-secondary-dentofacial-deformities-adult-pa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6889784,"mean":6.1841211059894,"rank":4890017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1753517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6889784,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238337,"mean":9.3917211919307,"rank":146564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":76010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238337,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3220,"mean":0.64588195091643,"rank":549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":2508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3220,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":0.63982300884956,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"KR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JCSOnline1\/statuses\/663659587376017409","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4740039],"posted_on":"2015-11-09T10:09:10+00:00","author":{"name":"JCS Online","url":"http:\/\/www.jcraniofacialsurgery.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1397343347\/JCranioSurg_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery serves as a forum of communication for all those involved in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery.","id_on_source":"JCSOnline1","tweeter_id":"317871694","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":118},"tweet_id":"663659587376017409"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JCSOnline1\/statuses\/681842400503803905","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4740039],"posted_on":"2015-12-29T14:21:10+00:00","author":{"name":"JCS Online","url":"http:\/\/www.jcraniofacialsurgery.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1397343347\/JCranioSurg_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery serves as a forum of communication for all those involved in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery.","id_on_source":"JCSOnline1","tweeter_id":"317871694","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":118},"tweet_id":"681842400503803905"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/darrensmithmd\/statuses\/681849967883988993","license":"gnip","rt":["JCSOnline1"],"citation_ids":[4740039],"posted_on":"2015-12-29T14:51:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Darren Smith","url":"http:\/\/www.darrensmithmd.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533720085278380033\/TVyRP_7Y_normal.jpeg","description":"#PlasticSurgeon in #NYC.
