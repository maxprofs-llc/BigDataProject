We also examined laterality measures (handedness, footedness, and earedness), sex, and age as predictors of spatial behaviour component scores. 12 principal components were identified that represented facets of spatial behaviour and perception. Canonical analysis revealed 2 underlying dimensions of perceived difficulty in performing spatial behaviours: difficulty with spatial relations in the context of movement and difficulty with judging how things relate to each other or to a larger surround. Sex was more closely related to the former dimension; laterality measures and age were more closely related to the latter. With respect to specific components, women tended to report more difficulty with making judgements in relation to earth-fixed axes but less difficulty in judging relations to nearby objects and how objects fit together or within a surround. Right-handedness was associated with more perceived difficulty in judging spatial relations while driving, overlaying surfaces, and moving in relation to other objects in nearby space. Future confirmatory analyses will be needed to establish subscales of the ESBQ and their usefulness for practical applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001323","authors":["Carol A.
