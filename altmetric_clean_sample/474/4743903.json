Molecular imprinting offers a route to the creation of specific and selective cavities in a 3D-polymeric network, which are complementary not only to the size and shape of a target species, but also provide interaction points and a coordination sphere around the template molecule. Given the challenges facing biosensor technologists, it is natural that this approach to create potentially highly stable synthetic ligands as an alternative to, or to compliment natural receptors, should emerge as a key line of interdisciplinary research. Despite the profuse amount of recent literature on molecularly-imprinted polymers (MIPs) and some limited commercial activity, these promising materials still need to overcome some limitations before taking their place in analytical market. In this review, we have focused on the most promising advances in MIP-based biosensors to illustrate how close to market they really are. We present our material under five main sections covering computational design, polymerisation strategies, material combinations, recent sensor designs and manufacturing issues. Each section provides technical details and evaluates the effect on sensor performance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f7","authors":["Uzun, Lokman","Turner, Anthony P F"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bios.2015.07.013","first_seen_on":"2015-11-10T08:31:20+00:00","issns":["1873-4235","09565663"],"journal":"Biosensors & Bioelectronics","last_mentioned_on":1447179962,"links":["http:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/a\/1S0Mj3PVtpRNxT","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0956566315302621&_version=1&md5=1bb84f9fdbc2af8e5220a8209700febe"],"pmid":"26189406","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Molecularly-imprinted polymer sensors: realising their potential ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecularlyimprinted-polymer-sensors-realising-potential"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6554440,"mean":6.0725058611419,"rank":2432043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4023997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6554440,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209323,"mean":10.182305347742,"rank":81625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":123870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209323,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1756,"mean":2.6885219373219,"rank":343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":1400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1756,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":1.8022857142857,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
