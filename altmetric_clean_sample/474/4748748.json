In order to analyze the societal costs of patients with COPD, this study used a data mining and a macro-costing method on data from a South Korean national-level health survey and a national health insurance claims database from 2004 to 2013.\nThe total societal cost of COPD in 2013 was estimated to be $439.9 million for 1,419,914 patients. The direct medical cost for COPD was $214.3 million, which included a hospitalization cost of $96.3 million, an outpatient cost of $76.4 million, and a pharmaceutical cost of $41.6 million. The direct non-medical cost was estimated at $43.5 million. The indirect overall cost associated with the morbidity and mortality of COPD was $182.2 million in 2013.\nThis study showed that COPD has a major effect on healthcare costs, particularly direct medical costs. Thus, appropriate long-term interventions are recommended to lower the economic burden of COPD in South Korea.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d4f","authors":["Jinhyun Kim"],"doi":"10.3111\/13696998.2015.1100114","first_seen_on":"2015-11-11T10:23:53+00:00","issns":["1941-837X"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Economics","last_mentioned_on":1447237410,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3111\/13696998.2015.1100114?ai=1n83w&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"26414920","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"The economic burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from 2004 to 2013","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/economic-burden-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-2004-2013-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6559289,"mean":6.0768461753774,"rank":4852396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":963560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6559289,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209273,"mean":10.178046523185,"rank":143697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209273,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":625,"mean":2.6146217948718,"rank":399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":625,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.7805555555556,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JME_Journal\/statuses\/664387969579507712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4748748],"posted_on":"2015-11-11T10:23:30+00:00","author":{"name":"J of Med Economics","url":"http:\/\/www.jmejournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/844905347110354944\/XOl7nnWF_normal.jpg","description":"MEDLINE indexed, peer-reviewed journal publishing leading studies that determine the cost-effectiveness of treatment, and high-quality economic assessments.","id_on_source":"JME_Journal","tweeter_id":"31438354","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1135},"tweet_id":"664387969579507712"}]}}
