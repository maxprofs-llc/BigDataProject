Among the most used confirmatory tests for PHA is urinary aldosterone determination after oral sodium loading test. The primary aim of our study was to investigate if sodium concentrations interfere with urinary aldosterone in an automated competitive immunoassay (Liaison\u00ae) as well as to verify the manufacturer's specifications.\n24-h urine samples were collected and stored frozen until assayed. Two pools at low and high aldosterone concentrations were prepared. Verification of performance for precision was tested according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP15-A2 and interference with increasing concentrations of NaCl according to CLSI EP7-A2.\nThe assay met the quality specifications according to optimal biological variation. Our results show that sodium concentrations up to 200mmol\/L do not interfere on urinary aldosterone quantification, but sodium concentrations above 486mmol\/L negatively interfere with the test.\nThe Liaison\u00ae automated method is useful for aldosterone determination in the PHA confirmatory test, but interferences with NaCl may occur. It is therefore recommended to determine urinary NaCl before measuring urinary aldosterone to avoid falsely low results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000377d","authors":["Aldea, Marta Luc\u00eda","Barallat, Jaume","Martin, Mar\u00eda Amparo","Rosas, Irene","Pastor, Mar\u00eda Cruz","Granada, Mar\u00eda Luisa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clinbiochem.2015.11.004","first_seen_on":"2015-11-10T09:32:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00099120","1873-2933"],"journal":"Clinical Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1447147920,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0009912015005147&_version=1&md5=e95edb0da58725c03c60ba71e37deaa9"],"pmid":"26562029","pubdate":"2015-11-13T22:01:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Sodium interference in the determination of urinary aldosterone ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sodium-interference-determination-urinary-aldosterone"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6554440,"mean":6.0725058611419,"rank":5591667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6554440,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209322,"mean":10.182383850641,"rank":166743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209322,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":613,"mean":2.4473235294118,"rank":385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":613,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":0.64555555555556,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Chemical Engineering":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ClinChemINFO\/statuses\/664012622350581760","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4744088],"posted_on":"2015-11-10T09:32:00+00:00","author":{"name":"ClinChemINFO","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalchemistry.info","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/556141595234275329\/392ECMgd_normal.png","id_on_source":"ClinChemINFO","tweeter_id":"2981358863","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":534},"tweet_id":"664012622350581760"}]}}
