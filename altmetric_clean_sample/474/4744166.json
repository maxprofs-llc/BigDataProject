Two non-tuberculous mycobacterial strains, UM_3 and UM_11, were isolated from the trunk wash of captive elephants in Malaysia. As they appeared to be identical phenotypes, they were investigated further by conventional and whole genome sequence-based methods of strain differentiation. Methods. Multiphasic investigations on the isolates included species identification with hsp65 PCR-sequencing, conventional biochemical tests, rapid biochemical profiling using API strips and the Biolog Phenotype Microarray analysis, protein profiling with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, repetitive sequence-based PCR typing and whole genome sequencing followed by phylogenomic analyses. Results. The isolates were shown to be possibly novel slow-growing schotochromogens with highly similar biological and genotypic characteristics. Both strains have a genome size of 5.2 Mbp, G+C content of 68.8%, one rRNA operon and 52 tRNAs each. They qualified for classification into the same species with their average nucleotide identity of 99.98% and tetranucleotide correlation coefficient of 0.99999. At the subspecies level, both strains showed 98.8% band similarity in the Diversilab automated repetitive sequence-based PCR typing system, 96.2% similarity in protein profiles obtained by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, and a genomic distance that is close to zero in the phylogenomic tree constructed with conserved orthologs. Detailed epidemiological tracking revealed that the elephants shared a common habitat eight years apart, thus, strengthening the possibility of a clonal relationship between the two strains.","altmetric_jid":"521f51273cf0582f62000000","authors":["Kok-Gan Chan","Mun Fai Loke","Bee Lee Ong","Yan Ling Wong","Kar Wai Hong","Kian Hin Tan","Sargit Kaur","Hien Fuh Ng","MFA Abdul Razak","Yun Fong Ngeow"],"doi":"10.7717\/peerj.1367","first_seen_on":"2015-11-10T10:00:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2167-8359"],"journal":"PeerJ","last_mentioned_on":1454961545,"links":["https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/1367\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26587340?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/1367.pdf","pmid":"26587340","pubdate":"2015-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","title":"Multiphasic strain differentiation of atypical mycobacteria from elephant trunk wash.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiphasic-strain-differentiation-atypical-mycobacteria-elephant-trunk-wash"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7140824,"mean":6.3067650711939,"rank":1686296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4577737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7140824,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238435,"mean":9.4198811998289,"rank":68919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":166012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238435,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2902,"mean":20.348577042399,"rank":1708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":1161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2902,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241,"mean":15.0018,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
