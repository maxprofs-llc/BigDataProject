We have created a localized 3D-printed smart wound dressing platform that will allow for real-time data acquisition of oxygen concentration, which is an important indicator of wound healing. This will serve as the first leg of a feedback loop for a fully optimized treatment mechanism tailored to the individual patient. A flexible oxygen sensor was designed and fabricated with high sensitivity and linear current output. With a series of off-the-shelf electronic components including a programmable-gain analog front-end, a microcontroller and wireless radio, an integrated electronic system with data readout and wireless transmission capabilities was assembled in a compact package. Using an elastomeric material, a bandage with exceptional flexibility and tensile strength was 3D-printed. The bandage contains cavities for both the oxygen sensor and the electronic systems, with contacts interfacing the two systems. Our integrated, flexible platform is the first step toward providing a self-operating, highly optimized remote therapy for chronic wounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f6100076e0","authors":["Mostafalu, Pooria","Lenk, William","Dokmeci, Mehmet R","Ziaie, Babak","Khademhosseini, Ali","Sonkusale, Sameer R","Pooria Mostafalu","William Lenk","Mehmet R.
