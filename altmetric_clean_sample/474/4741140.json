Ten healthy adult domestic cats (weighing 2.9 \u00b1 0.5 kg) were used in this study. Rectal temperature (T), pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (fR) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) were measured and recorded prior to intramuscular (IM) administration of butorphanol (0.2 mg\/kg), medetomidine (20 ug\/kg) and alfaxalone (5 mg\/kg) and then every 10 min until return of consciousness. Qualitative scores for induction of anesthesia and recovery were allocated, duration of anesthesia and recovery were calculated, and adverse events were recorded. A needle prick with a 22-gauge hypodermic needle was used to assess analgesia. Scores for induction and recovery quality were acceptable. No significant adverse events except nausea (7\/10) and vomiting (5\/10) were observed. The mean \u00b1 SD times from induction to extubation and to standing (full recovery) were 114 \u00b1 8 and 125 \u00b1 7 min, respectively. There were statistically significant changes in PR, fR and SAP after induction of anesthesia. The combination of butorphanol, medetomidine and alfaxalone provided acceptable quality of anesthesia and analgesia and exerted minimal cardiopulmonary effects in domestic cats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1f","authors":["Kim, Ye-Won","Suh, Sangil","Choi, Ran","Hyun, Changbaig"],"doi":"10.1292\/jvms.15-0288","first_seen_on":"2015-11-09T15:47:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1347-7439"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1447156742,"links":["https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jvms\/advpub\/0\/advpub_15-0288\/_article","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26549435?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26549435?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26549435","pubdate":"2015-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Evaluation of quality of anesthesia and analgesia and of vital signs after intramuscular administration of a combination of butorphanol, medetomidine and alfaxalone in cats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-quality-anesthesia-analgesia-vital-signs-after-intramuscular-administration-combination-b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6554440,"mean":6.0725058611419,"rank":2534251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3941949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6554440,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210238,"mean":10.211623206191,"rank":86180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":121046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210238,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1342,"mean":0.96713199105145,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":1190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1342,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":0.71640625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
