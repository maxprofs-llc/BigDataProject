Hypotheses were postulated to explain the alternative metabolic pathways involved, but as yet direct analysis of the relative redistribution of label through the corresponding pathways were not evaluated. Here, we describe the use of stable isotope labelling experiments for studying metabolism under hypoxia using wild-type roots of the crop legume soybean (Glycine max). 13C-pyruvate labelling was performed to compare metabolism through the TCA cycle, fermentation, alanine metabolism and the \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) shunt, whilst 13C-glutamate and 15N-ammonium labelling were performed to address the metabolism via glutamate to succinate. Following these labellings, the time course for the redistribution of the 13C\/15N label throughout the metabolic network was evaluated with gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). Our combined labelling data suggest the inhibition of the TCA-cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), also known as Complex-II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, providing support for the bifurcation of the cycle and the downregulation of the rate of respiration measured during hypoxic stress. Moreover, up-regulation of the GABA shunt and alanine metabolism explained the accumulation of succinate and alanine during hypoxia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Antonio, Carla","P\u00e4pke, Carola","Rocha, Marcio","Diab, Houssein","Limami, Anis M","Obata, Toshihiro","Fernie, Alisdair R","van Dongen, Joost T"],"doi":"10.1104\/pp.15.00266","endpage":"56","first_seen_on":"2015-11-11T11:20:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2548","0032-0889"],"issue":"1","journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1474713735,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26553649?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.plantphysiol.org\/content\/early\/2015\/11\/09\/pp.15.00266.abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26553649?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26553649","pubdate":"2015-11-11T22:00:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"43","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Regulation of primary metabolism in response to low oxygen availability as revealed by carbon and nitrogen isotope redistribution","type":"article","volume":"170","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-primary-metabolism-response-low-oxygen-availability-revealed-carbon-nitrogen-isotope-redi-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":4253699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3954507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246284,"mean":9.7019417743001,"rank":116633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":119620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246284,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3963,"mean":4.2300969207471,"rank":2350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3963,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":6.5479523809524,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
