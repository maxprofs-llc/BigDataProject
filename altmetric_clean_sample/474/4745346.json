Their precise roles in the CD8+ T cell response, however, remain unclear. In this report, we show that in the absence of the microRNA miR-150, CD8+ T cells fail to undergo robust expansion and differentiation into short-lived terminal effector cells in response to primary infection with Listeria monocytogenes or Vaccinia virus. Notably, even after transitioning into the memory pool, miR-150(-\/-) cells still mount a weaker recall response to secondary infection, and remain less differentiated than their wild-type counterparts. Transcriptome analysis shows miR-150 gene targets are globally upregulated in cells lacking miR-150, and amongst these targets, we found misregulation of genes associated with proliferation and effector cell function. These transcriptome data suggest that miR-150 deficient CD8+ T cells are less efficient in killing infected cells, which we validate experimentally. Together, these results reveal a cell-intrinsic role for miR-150 in the regulation of effector CD8+ T cell fate and function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Smith, Norah L","Wissink, Erin M","Grimson, Andrew","Rudd, Brian D"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep16399","first_seen_on":"2015-11-10T13:00:57+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nigms"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1453171794,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26549197","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26549197?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep16399"],"pmid":"26549197","pubdate":"2015-11-10T22:01:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Adaptive immunity","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"CD8-positive T cells","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"miR-150 Regulates Differentiation and Cytolytic Effector Function in CD8+ T cells","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir150-regulates-differentiation-cytolytic-effector-function-cd8-t-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6992211,"mean":6.2499931892752,"rank":1050346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5938686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6992211,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237768,"mean":9.3966827860889,"rank":47015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":190556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237768,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25170,"mean":14.450838571258,"rank":6344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":18805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25170,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2345,"mean":13.557251706485,"rank":561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2345,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
