The procedural success rate was 100%. Single-stent group had significantly lower ostial residual stenosis of left anterior descending and higher ostial residual stenosis of left circumflex as compared to double-stent group. During the hospitalization period, no major adverse cardiovascular events were observed in the two groups. During the follow-up period, restenosis was observed in 1 case in single-stent group and in 2 cases in double-stent group, respectively. Recurrence of angina and target lesion revascularization was observed in 6 and 1 case in single-stent group, and 4 and 2 cases in double-stent group, respectively. There was no acute myocardial infarction, in-stent thrombosis and cardiac death in both of the groups.\nBoth stenting strategies were feasible for distal ULMCA bifurcation lesions with a high operation success rate and safety. Single-stent technique had lower ostial residual stenosis of left anterior descending whereas double-stents technique had lower ostial residual stenosis of left circumflex.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc2a","authors":["Zhang, Jiangang","Liu, Shuai","Geng, Tao","Xu, Zesheng"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-10T08:07:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-5901"],"issue":"8","journal":"International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1447142862,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26550422"],"pmid":"26550422","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"One-stent versus two-stent techniques for distal unprotected left main coronary artery bifurcation lesions.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/onestent-versus-twostent-techniques-distal-unprotected-left-main-coronary-artery-bifurcation-lesions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6554440,"mean":6.0725058611419,"rank":5591661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6554440,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209323,"mean":10.182325412522,"rank":166743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209323,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":946,"mean":1.4047470899471,"rank":475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":946,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.738,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drtars\/statuses\/663991405367422977","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4743839],"posted_on":"2015-11-10T08:07:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Tars the Robot","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_6_normal.png","id_on_source":"drtars","tweeter_id":"3982165613","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"663991405367422977"}]}}
