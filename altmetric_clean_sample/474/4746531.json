The effect upon the HO2 uptake coefficient \u03b3 of adding different organic species (malonic acid, citric acid, 1,2 diaminoethane, tartronic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and oxalic acid) into the copper (II) doped aerosols was investigated. The HO2 uptake coefficient decreased steadily from the mass accommodation value to \u03b3 = 0.008 \u00b1 0.009 when EDTA was added in a one-to-one molar ratio with the copper (II) ions, and to \u03b3 = 0.003 \u00b1 0.004 when oxalic acid was added into the aerosol in a ten-to-one molar ratio with the copper (II). EDTA binds strongly to copper (II) ions potentially making them unavailable for catalytic destruction of HO2, and could also be acting as a surfactant or changing the viscosity of the aerosol. The addition of oxalic acid to the aerosol potentially forms low-volatility copper-oxalate complexes that reduce the uptake of HO2 either by changing the viscosity of the aerosol or causing precipitation out of the aerosol forming a coating. It is likely that there is a high enough oxalate to copper (II) ion ratio in many types of atmospheric aerosols to decrease the HO2 uptake coefficient. No observable change in the HO2 uptake coefficient was measured when the other organic species (malonic acid, citric acid, 1,2 diaminoethane and tartronic acid) were added in a ten-to-one molar ratio with the copper (II) ions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Pascale S.
