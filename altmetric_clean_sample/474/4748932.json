NK cells not only induce early and rapid innate immune responses, but also communicate with dendritic cells to shape the adaptive immunity, thus bridging innate and adaptive immunity. Although the functional biology of NK cells is well-documented in a variety of infections in humans and mice, their role in protecting domestic animals from infectious agents is only beginning to be understood. In this article, we summarize the current state of knowledge about the contribution of NK cells in pathogen defense in domestic animals, especially cattle and pigs. Understanding the immunobiology of NK cells will translate into strategies to manipulate these cells for preventive and therapeutic purposes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f9","authors":["Shekhar, Sudhanshu","Yang, Xi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vetimm.2015.10.001","first_seen_on":"2015-11-11T11:14:37+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1873-2534","01652427"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Veterinary Immunology & Immunopathology","last_mentioned_on":1466968451,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26553564?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26553564?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26553564","pubdate":"2015-11-11T22:00:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Natural killer cells in host defense against veterinary pathogens.","type":"article","volume":"168","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/natural-killer-cells-host-defense-against-veterinary-pathogens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7947684,"mean":6.7156263575118,"rank":3587382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4281015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7947684,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242464,"mean":9.5664105863574,"rank":98232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":139830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242464,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":539,"mean":2.2278066914498,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":539,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.64473684210526,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
