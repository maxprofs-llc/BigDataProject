Indeed, a revision of their categorical status at IUCN Red List is necessary. We herein report a new distribution range (Lapa do Cip\u00f3 cave) of the troglobitic species I. uai and C. eleonorae, which are, to date, known to occur in the Olhos d'\u00c1gua cave, located at the Perua\u00e7u Caves National Park (PCNP).","altmetric_jid":"552536762a83eec8018b456a","authors":["Bruno Gabriel do Monte","Bruno Gabriel do Monte"," Jonas Eduardo Gall\u00e3o"," Diego von Schimonsky"," Maria Elina Bichuette"],"doi":"10.3897\/bdj.3.e5260","first_seen_on":"2015-11-10T10:48:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1314-2828"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biodiversity Data Journal","last_mentioned_on":1490477143,"links":["http:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/articles.php?id=5260","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/BDJ.3.e5260"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/lib\/ajax_srv\/article_elements_srv.php?action=download_pdf&item_id=5260","pmcid":"PMC4678797","pmid":"26696758","pubdate":"2015-10-11T09:26:26+00:00","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","title":"New records of two endemic troglobitic and threatened arachnids (Amblypygi and Opiliones) from limestone caves of Minas Gerais state, southeast Brazil","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-records-two-endemic-troglobitic-threatened-arachnids-amblypygi-opiliones-limestone-caves-minas-g"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.95,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":1713683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6694339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246307,"mean":9.7094065349605,"rank":56694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":189318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246307,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":388,"mean":10.332821705426,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":388,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":9.2822222222222,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
