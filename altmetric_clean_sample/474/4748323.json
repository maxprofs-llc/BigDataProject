In the present study, a conditioning procedure using threat-related conditioned stimuli (CSs) was implemented while executive load and attentional focus were manipulated. The modulation effects of neuroticism and contingency awareness were also examined. Results showed that fear conditioning depended on the available executive resources even with threat-related CSs. In addition, although individuals with high neuroticism showed an enhanced conditioning effect overall, this facilitation effect still depended on the availability of executive resources. Finally, the impact of attentional focus was most evident among individuals with high neuroticism who were aware of the contingency. Overall, the present study demonstrates interactive effects of emotion and attention in fear conditioning, while illuminating mechanisms of individual differences and clarifying the controversial role of contingency awareness in fear conditioning.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023da","authors":["Hur, Juyoen","Iordan, Alexandru D","Berenbaum, Howard","Dolcos, Florin","Juyoen Hur","Alexandru D.
