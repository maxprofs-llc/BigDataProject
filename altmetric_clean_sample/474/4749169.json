The organ most often affected is the skin. The World Health Organization classifies cutaneous mastocytosis into mastocytoma, maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis, and diffuse mastocytosis. The systemic variants in this classification are as follows: indolent systemic mastocytosis (SM), aggressive SM, SM with an associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease, mast cell leukemia, mast cell sarcoma, and extracutaneous mastocytoma. The two latest systemic variants are rare. Although the course of disease is unpredictable in children, lesions generally resolve by early adulthood. In adults, however, the disease tends to persist. The goal of treatment should be to control clinical manifestations caused by the release of mast cell mediators and, in more aggressive forms of the disease, to reduce mast cell burden.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006870","authors":["Aza\u00f1a, J M","Torrelo, A","Matito, A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ad.2015.09.009","first_seen_on":"2015-11-11T11:35:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1578-2190"],"journal":"Actas Dermo-Sifiliogr\u00e1ficas","last_mentioned_on":1453891057,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26525106","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=26525106"],"pmid":"26525106","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology","sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"Update on Mastocytosis (Part 2): Categories, Prognosis, and Treatment.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/actualizacin-en-mastocitosis-parte-2-categoras-pronstico-y-tratamiento"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7054473,"mean":6.2693339663096,"rank":5284221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7054473,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237982,"mean":9.4033622011841,"rank":162622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":42880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237982,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":1.9618737864078,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.5214285714286,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
