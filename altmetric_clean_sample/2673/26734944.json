In addition to the well-established role of genetic lesions and tumor-microenvironment interactions in the development of MM, deregulated epigenetic mechanisms are emerging as important in MM pathogenesis. Recently, MM sequencing and expression projects have revealed that mutations and copy number variations as well as deregulation in the expression of epigenetic modifiers are characteristic features of MM. In the past decade, several studies have suggested epigenetic mechanisms via DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs as important contributing factors in MM with impacts on disease initiation, progression, clonal heterogeneity and response to treatment. Herein we review the present view and knowledge that has accumulated over the past decades on the role of epigenetics in MM, with focus on the interplay between epigenetic mechanisms and the potential use of epigenetic inhibitors as future treatment modalities for MM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003507","authors":["Alzrigat, Mohammad","P\u00e1rraga, Alba Atienza","Jernberg-Wiklund, Helena","Mohammad Alzrigat","Alba Atienza P\u00e1rraga","Helena Jernberg-Wiklund"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.semcancer.2017.09.007","first_seen_on":"2017-09-29T08:19:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1044-579X","1044579X","1096-3650"],"journal":"Seminars in Cancer Biology","last_mentioned_on":1506909600,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1044579X17301049&_version=1&md5=6e982e7ce156c106f4e758be5f81aa4c","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28962927?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28962927?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28962927"],"pmid":"28962927","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Epigenetics in Multiple Myeloma: From Mechanisms to Therapy","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":1.75,"1w":1.75,"6d":1.75,"5d":1.75,"4d":1.75,"3d":0.75,"2d":0.75,"1d":0.75,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457582,"mean":7.1055906399159,"rank":3899011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4473547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457582,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108504,"mean":11.460185856612,"rank":44883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":61829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108504,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":339,"mean":3.1488461538462,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":339,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.8416666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"googleplus":[{"title":"Epigenetics in Multiple Myeloma: From Mechanisms to Therapy - Publication date: Available online 27 ...","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AlexandrosGSfakianakisMedicine\/posts\/RX5QbqrQaNQ","license":"public","citation_ids":[26734944],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T19:30:43+00:00","summary":"Epigenetics in Multiple Myeloma: From Mechanisms to Therapy - Publication date: Available online 27 ...
