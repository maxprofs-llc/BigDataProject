In this study, we describe the development of an adapted functional score for patient outcome monitoring, and document the rehabilitation care provided and patient outcomes in relation to this functional score.\nA descriptive cohort study was done, including all patients admitted in the KTC inpatient department (IPD) between January and June 2015. The adapted functional score was collected at four points in time: admission and discharge from both IPD and outpatient department (OPD).\nOut of the 1528 admitted patients, 92.3% (n\u00a0=\u00a01410) received at least one physiotherapy session. A total of 1022 patients sustained either lower limb fracture, upper limb fracture, traumatic brain injury or multiple injury. Among them, 966 patients received physiotherapy in IPD, of whom 596 (61.7%) received IPD sessions within 2 days of admission; 696 patients received physiotherapy in OPD. Functional independence increased over time; among patients having a functional score taken at admission and discharge from IPD, 32.2% (172\/535) were independent at discharge, and among patients having a functional score at OPD admission and discharge, 79% (75\/95) were independent at discharge.\nThe provision of physiotherapy was feasible in this humanitarian setting, and the tailored functional score appeared to be relevant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008dff","authors":["Gohy, B\u00e9rang\u00e8re","Ali, Engy","Van den Bergh, Rafael","Schillberg, Erin","Nasim, Masood","Naimi, Muhammad Mahmood","Cher\u00e9stal, Sophia","Falipou, Pauline","Weerts, Eric","Skelton, Peter","Van Overloop, Catherine","Trelles, Miguel","B\u00e9rang\u00e8re Gohy","Engy Ali","Rafael Van den Bergh","Erin Schillberg","Masood Nasim","Muhammad Mahmood Naimi","Sophia Cher\u00e9stal","Pauline Falipou","Eric Weerts","Peter Skelton","Catherine Van Overloop","Miguel Trelles"],"doi":"10.1093\/inthealth\/ihw039","first_seen_on":"2016-10-16T22:48:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-3405","1876-3413"],"journal":"International Health","last_mentioned_on":1506765656,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27738078","http:\/\/inthealth.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/13\/inthealth.ihw039.long","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/inthealth\/article\/8\/6\/381\/2337107\/Early-physical-and-functional-rehabilitation-of","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/inthealth\/ihw039","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27738078?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/inthealth.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/13\/inthealth.ihw039.full.pdf","pmid":"27738078","pubdate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Early physical and functional rehabilitation of trauma patients in the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res trauma centre in Kunduz, Afghanistan: luxury or necessity?","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/inthealth\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/inthealth\/ihw039","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-physical-functional-rehabilitation-trauma-patients-mdecins-sans-frontires-trauma-centre-kunduz"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0.25,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":3342562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5082996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251764,"mean":12.706085238895,"rank":90591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":159511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251764,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276,"mean":4.2506836363636,"rank":139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.44,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1,"US":1,"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/georgentou1\/statuses\/787784061372600320","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12667293],"posted_on":"2016-10-16T22:35:31+00:00","author":{"name":"GeorgeNtoumenopoulos","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/598014991996833792\/Qz5RX64Z_normal.jpg","description":"Physiotherapist working at GSH, University of Technology Sydney and St Vincent's Hospital.
