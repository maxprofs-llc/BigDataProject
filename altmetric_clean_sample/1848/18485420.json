The length of cardiac surgery training prevents HHR supply from adapting in a timely fashion to changes in demand, resulting in a critical need for active workforce management. This study details the results of the 2015 Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons (CSCS) workforce survey undertaken as part of the CSCS strategy for active workforce management. The 38-question survey was administered electronically to all 96 trainees identified as being registered in a Canadian cardiac surgery residency program for the 2015-2016 academic year. Eighty-four of 96 (88%) trainees responded. The majority of participants were satisfied with their training experience. However, 29% stated that their clinical and operative exposure needed improvement, and 57% of graduating trainees did not believe that they would be competent to practice independently at the conclusion of their training. Although 51% of participants believe the job market is improving, 94% of senior trainees found it competitive or extremely difficult to secure an attending staff position. Participants highlighted a need for improved career counselling and formal mentorship. Although the job market is perceived to be improving, a mismatch in the cardiac surgery workforce supply and demand remains because current trainees continue to experience difficulty securing employment after the completion of residency training. Trainees have identified improved career counselling and mentorship as potential strategies to aid graduates in securing employment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006dae","authors":["Holly E.M.
