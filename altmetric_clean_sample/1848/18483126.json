Pregnancies resulting in a singleton outcome were analyzed and newborn gender was utilized as a means to identify the implanted embryo. MtDNA quantity was then compared between implanted and non-implanted embryos in order to define the predictive value of mtDNA content for reproductive potential in this subset of patients.\nAn initial comparison of mtDNA levels between all successful and unsuccessful embryos revealed no significant differences. In order to control for patient-specific variables, gender was subsequently used to identify the implanted embryo in DETs resulting in a singleton (n = 69). No systematic difference in relative mtDNA quantity was detected between implanted and non-implanted embryos.\nThis study was conducted at a single center and did not evaluate the entire cohort of embryos from each patient to evaluate cohort specific variation in mtDNA quantity. Although the largest of its kind so far, the sample size of DETs leading to a singleton was relatively small.\nThese data highlight the importance of control over patient-specific variables when evaluating candidate biomarkers of reproductive potential. All current available data suggest that mtDNA quantification needs further study before its clinical use to augment embryo selection.\nThe authors have no potential conflict of interest to declare. No external funding was obtained for this study.\nNot applicable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100072ea","authors":["Treff, Nathan R.","Zhan, Yiping","Tao, Xin","Olcha, Meir","Han, Michael","Rajchel, Jessica","Morrison, Liza","Morin, Scott J.","Scott, Richard T."],"doi":"10.1093\/humrep\/dex034","first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T11:23:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0268-1161","1460-2350"],"journal":"Human Reproduction","last_mentioned_on":1487888107,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/humrep\/article\/doi\/10.1093\/humrep\/dex034\/3045873\/Levels-of-trophectoderm-mitochondrial-DNA-do-not?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/humrep\/article-pdf\/32\/4\/954\/11022793\/dex034.pdf","pmid":"28333210","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Levels of trophectoderm mitochondrial DNA do not predict the reproductive potential of sibling embryos","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/levels-trophectoderm-mitochondrial-dna-not-predict-reproductive-potential-sibling-embryos"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":5973425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1993310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245795,"mean":12.965132834813,"rank":160653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":70606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245795,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3375,"mean":8.2413212803794,"rank":2874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3375,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":8.0520689655172,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
