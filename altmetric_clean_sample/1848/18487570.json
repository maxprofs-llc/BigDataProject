Here, we have summarized recent literature dealing with the main catabolic and anabolic factors influencing protein kinetics in acute hypercatabolic patients.\nProtein\/amino acid intake levels should be adapted to type and severity of illness, keeping in mind that energy overfeeding is associated with poor outcome. A number of anticatabolic nutraceuticals and drugs have been tested in acute patients. The encouraging results have been obtained with \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate, omega-3 fatty acids, oxandrolone, propranolol, and metformin. Their efficacy and lack of side-effects need to be confirmed. Physical therapy, including muscle electro-stimulation, appears a very promising intervention, both effective and safe.\nProtein catabolism can be minimized in acute patients by adequate nutritional support, early mobilization, and, possibly, pharmacological and nutraceutical interventions. A combination of these strategies should be tested in randomized controlled trials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000706a","authors":["Di Girolamo, Filippo G.","Situlin, Roberta","Biolo, Gianni"],"doi":"10.1097\/mco.0000000000000347","first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T15:55:42+00:00","issns":["1363-1950"],"issue":"2","journal":"Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care","last_mentioned_on":1491285600,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-clinicalnutrition\/Fulltext\/2017\/03000\/What_factors_influence_protein_synthesis_and.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-clinicalnutrition\/2017\/03000\/What_factors_influence_protein_synthesis_and.6.pdf","pmid":"28002075","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"124","subjects":["metabolism","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"What factors influence protein synthesis and degradation in critical illness?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-clinicalnutrition\/Fulltext\/2017\/03000\/What_factors_influence_protein_synthesis_and.6.aspx","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-influence-protein-synthesis-degradation-critical-illness-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":7307304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250797,"mean":13.082404033557,"rank":207335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250797,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":877,"mean":7.9757283105023,"rank":849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":877,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.9038095238095,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1769266990053893&id=1685480611765865","license":"public","citation_ids":[18487570],"posted_on":"2017-04-04T06:00:00+00:00","summary":"What factors influence protein synthesis and degradation in critical illness?\n\nIf you are considering undertaking an intervention research study in the area of nutritional support, this open access review published in the journal Current Opinion  in Clinic","author":{"name":"Clinical Dietetics","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1685480611765865","facebook_wall_name":"Clinical Dietetics","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1685480611765865\/picture","id_on_source":"1685480611765865"}}]}}
