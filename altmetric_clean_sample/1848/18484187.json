K-877 is a novel selective PPAR\u03b1 modulator (SPPARM\u03b1) that enhances PPAR\u03b1 transcriptional activity with high selectivity and potency, resulting in reduced plasma lipid levels. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of K-877 on hyperlipidemia in low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (Ldlr(-\/-)) mice, a mouse model of atherosclerosis. We revealed that K-877 administration significantly decreased plasma triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels and increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in Ldlr(-\/-) mice. K-877 administration to Ldlr(-\/-) mice efficiently increased the gene expression of PPAR\u03b1 and its target genes related to fatty acid oxidation in the liver and small intestine. The same treatment significantly increased ATP-binding cassette a1 gene expression in the liver and small intestine and reduced Niemann Pick C1-like 1 gene expression in the small intestine, suggesting that K-877 administration induced HDL-C production in the liver and small intestine and reduced cholesterol absorption in the small intestine. In conclusion, K-877 administration had pronounced effects on the liver and small intestine in Ldlr(-\/-) mice. K-877 is an attractive PPAR\u03b1-modulating drug for treating hyperlipidemia that works equally well in both the liver and small intestine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de1","authors":["Kenta Takei","Yoshimi Nakagawa","Yunong Wang","Song-iee Han","Aoi Satoh","Motohiro Sekiya","Takashi Matsuzaka","Hitoshi Shimano"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jphs.2017.02.003","first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T12:21:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13478613","1347-8648"],"journal":"Journal of Pharmacological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1491308477,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28366492?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28366492","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Effects of K-877, a novel selective PPAR\u03b1 modulator, on small intestine contribute to the amelioration of hyperlipidemia in low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-k877-novel-selective-ppar%CE%B1-modulator-small-intestine-contribute-amelioration-hyperlipidemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":7307333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250798,"mean":13.08230063358,"rank":207362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250798,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":341,"mean":2.3785823529412,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":341,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SleepResearch_\/statuses\/849235423847206912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18484187],"posted_on":"2017-04-04T12:21:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Sleep Research","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Sleep-Research\/105093012946768?ref=hl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2694954403\/9f320ff3ac0d13ed3582e204a8c1c768_normal.jpeg","description":"Highlights and news from the latest research on sleep","id_on_source":"SleepResearch_","tweeter_id":"868205960","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1640},"tweet_id":"849235423847206912"}]}}
