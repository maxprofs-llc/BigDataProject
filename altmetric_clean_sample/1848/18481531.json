Variation in uptake described according to geography, maternal age, ethnicity and parity as reported by the midwife completing the survey.\nA total of 1325 surveys were returned, 85% of which (1128) contained information about vaccination. Vaccine uptake was 61.8% (95% CI: 56.8-66.5) and was higher in the White British ethnic group than any other (67.7%, 95% CI: 63.5 to 71.5). Uptake was higher outside London (65.3%, 95% CI: 61.1-69.3) than within London (31.0%, 95% CI: 24.9-38.0). Reported uptake was lower in areas of high deprivation, and in women of higher parity, observations that were not statistically significant in the multivariable model. Overall, 74% of women were vaccinated between 28 and 32 weeks.\nPertussis vaccine uptake in pregnant women varies significantly across the country and is affected by ethnicity, deprivation and parity. Variations should be addressed through service delivery models designed to reduce potential inequalities in infant protection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a98","authors":["McAuslane, H.","Utsi, L.","Wensley, A.","Coole, L."],"doi":"10.1093\/pubmed\/fdx032","first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T10:24:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-3842","1741-3850"],"journal":"Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1490166780,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jpubhealth\/article\/doi\/10.1093\/pubmed\/fdx032\/3077004\/Inequalities-in-maternal-pertussis-vaccination?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jpubhealth\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/pubmed\/fdx032\/11048030\/fdx032.pdf","pmid":"28369548","pubdate":"2017-04-04T22:06:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Inequalities in maternal pertussis vaccination uptake: a cross-sectional survey of maternity units","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inequalities-maternal-pertussis-vaccination-uptake-crosssectional-survey-maternity-units"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":1624185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6751296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249113,"mean":13.072831264652,"rank":66025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":181965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249113,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1306,"mean":9.3505793103448,"rank":391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1306,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":15.058214285714,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Inequalities in maternal pertussis vaccination uptake: a cross-sectional survey of maternity units","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/2017\/journal-article-abstracts\/inequalities-in-maternal-pertussis-vaccination-uptake-a-cross-sectional-survey-of-maternity-units\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[18481531],"posted_on":"2017-03-22T07:13:00+00:00","summary":"&hellip;\nView original article:&nbsp;\nInequalities in maternal pertussis vaccination uptake: a cross-sectional survey of maternity units\nThe post Inequalities in maternal pertussis vaccination uptake: a cross-sectional survey of maternity units was curated","author":{"name":"information for practice","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/","description":"news, new scholarship &amp; more from around the world"}}]}}
