The improvement of imaging resolution is one of the most important goals for UCNPs used in biological applications. Super-resolution imaging techniques that overcome the fundamental diffraction limit of light rely on the photochemistry of organic dyes or fluorescent proteins. Here we report our progress toward super-resolution microscopy with UCNPs. We found that the red emission (655 nm) of core\/shell UCNPs with the structure NaYF4:Yb(3+),Er(3+)\/NaYF4 could be modulated by emission depletion (ED) of the intermediate state that interacts resonantly with an infrared beam (1540 nm). In contrast, the green emission bands (525 and 545 nm) of the UCNPs were less affected by irradiation with the infrared beam. The origin of such distinct behaviors between the green and red emissions was attributed to their different photophysical pathways.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Kyujin Shin","Taeyoung Jung","Eunsang Lee","Gibok Lee","Yeongchang Goh","Junseok Heo","Minhyuk Jung","Eun-Jung Jo","Hohjai Lee","Min-Gon Kim","Kang Taek Lee"],"doi":"10.1039\/c7cp00918f","first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T10:02:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1463-9076","1463-9084"],"journal":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP)","last_mentioned_on":1491300134,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28367577?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28367577","pubdate":"2017-04-04T22:11:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Distinct mechanisms for the upconversion of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles revealed by stimulated emission depletion","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distinct-mechanisms-upconversion-nayf-4-yb-3-er-3-nanoparticles-revealed-stimulated-emission-depleti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":7307314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250797,"mean":13.082357780825,"rank":207339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250797,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4372,"mean":2.0496055822466,"rank":2950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4372,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":344,"mean":1.2487172011662,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":344,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SRMicro_papers\/statuses\/849200429141544961","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18480494],"posted_on":"2017-04-04T10:02:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Super Res Microscopy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/789566896286728192\/otGAZOp0_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot for anything related to super resolution microscopy","id_on_source":"SRMicro_papers","tweeter_id":"2372788392","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":529},"tweet_id":"849200429141544961"}]}}
