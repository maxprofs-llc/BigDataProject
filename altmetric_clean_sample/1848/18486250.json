Stunted children were older in age (P=0.006) and presented late (P=0.003). Splenectomy (n=26) improved anemia (P<0.001). However, height-for-age did not improve at 1-year, or 4.5-years (median) following splenectomy (P=1.0). Number of underweight children did not reduce at 1- (P=0.21), or 4.5-years (P=0.21) following surgery.\nGrowth-failure is frequent in children with hereditary spherocytosis in India. Splenectomy corrected the anemia but failed to improve the growth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007764","authors":["Das, Anirban","Bansal, Deepak","Trehan, Amita","Das, Reena"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T14:31:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0974-7559"],"journal":"Indian Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1491316294,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28368266?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"28368266","pubdate":"2017-04-04T14:31:55+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Growth Failure in Hereditary Spherocytosis and the Effect of Splenectomy","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":6416990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250797,"mean":13.082373929408,"rank":179315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250797,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":418,"mean":1.7783932853717,"rank":219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":418,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InOncology\/statuses\/849268207919611906","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18486250],"posted_on":"2017-04-04T14:31:34+00:00","author":{"name":"India Oncology 2.0","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/InOncology\/149384831739338","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1075687841\/12_normal.png","description":"The Latest in Oncology","id_on_source":"InOncology","tweeter_id":"166079744","geo":{"lt":20,"ln":77,"country":"IN"},"followers":137},"tweet_id":"849268207919611906"}]}}
