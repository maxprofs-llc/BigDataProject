The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical outcome of second-line EGFR-TKIs in the treatment of NSCLC patients according to different EGFR genotypes. Methods: The treatment outcomes of 166 NSCLC patients with different EGFR mutations treated by second-line TKIs were retrospectively reviewed. The efficacy was evaluated with Pearson chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The disease control rate (DCR) and objective response rate (ORR) of enrolled NSCLC patients were 77.7% and 11.4%, respectively. The exon 19 deletion group had a significantly longer median progression-free survival (PFS) (6.7 vs. 4.5 months, P=0.002) and overall survival (OS) (13.7 vs. 11.7 months, P=0.02) compared with the exon 19 L858R mutation group for NSCLC patients, as well for patients with brain metastasis [PFS: (6.7 vs. 3.9 months, p<0.001), OS: (13.7 vs. 7.9 months, p=0.006)]. No significant difference on PFS and OS was observed between exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation group for patients with bone metastasis. EGFR genotype and ECOG PS were independent predictors of PFS. Never smoking, exon 19 deletion, EGOC PS (0-1) and no brain metastasis were correlated with longer OS. No significant difference on side effect between exon 19 and 21 mutation group was observed. Conclusions: NSCLC patients harboring exon 19 deletion achieved better PFS and OS than those with L858R mutation, indicating that EGFR mutation is a significant prognostic factor for advanced NSCLC patients with and without brain metastasis receiving second-line EGFR-TKIs treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc3c","authors":["Zhen Zheng","Xiance Jin","Baochai Lin","Huafang Su","Hanbin Chen","Shaoran Fei","Lihao Zhao","Xia Deng","Deyao Xie","Congying Xie"],"doi":"10.7150\/jca.16959","first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T17:14:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1837-9664"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1491319298,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5370503\/","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.7150\/jca.16959"],"pmcid":"PMC5370503","pmid":"28367239","pubdate":"2017-04-04T20:17:00+00:00","publisher":"Ivyspring International Publisher","startpage":"597","title":"Efficacy of Second-line Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in the Treatment of Metastatic Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Harboring Exon 19 and 21 EGFR Mutations","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-secondline-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-treatment-metastatic-advanced-nonsmallcell-lung-cance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":7307370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250797,"mean":13.082362366226,"rank":207390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250797,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290,"mean":1.7950795847751,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.33333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"Efficacy of Second-line Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in the Treatment of Metastatic Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Harboring Exon 19 and 21 EGFR Mutations","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc\/comments\/63er29\/efficacy_of_secondline_tyrosine_kinase_inhibitors\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[18488954],"posted_on":"2017-04-04T15:21:38+00:00","author":{"name":"montaukwhaler","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc","id_on_source":"nsclc","followers":1,"subreddit":"non small cell lung cancer"}}]}}
