Most of them were female: (29, 59%). Most of them (n\u2009=\u200936; 75.0%) had myopia followed by hyperopia (n\u2009=\u200912;25.0%). Twenty-two (45.8%) participants had astigmatism. Similarly, 23 (47.9%) of them also were presbyopes. Most of the participants (39; 81.3%) wore glasses; 17 (35.4%) used contact lenses, and 17 (35.4%) had undergone refractive surgery. A total of 2,367 comments were coded. Thematic analysis resulted into 6 themes that informed about quality of life issues in people with refractive error. Concerns about cosmetic appearance, personal health and safety, difficulties in day-to-day activities, and inconveniences rendered in daily life were identified as the most important themes.\nThe findings of this study enrich the understanding on the issues important in people with refractive error. The quality of life issues identified will be used to develop a refractive error-specific item bank.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000254b","authors":["Kandel, Himal","Khadka, Jyoti","Goggin, Michael","Pesudovs, Konrad"],"doi":"10.1111\/ceo.12954","first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T13:25:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1442-9071","14426404"],"journal":"Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1502014599,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28370795","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ceo.12954\/abstract;jsessionid=822D9AA7555FC9AE35E3D776C20168F4.f04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ceo.12954\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ceo.12954\/pdf","pmid":"28370795","pubdate":"2017-04-04T13:25:27+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"A pair of glasses and beyond: impact of refractive error on people's well-being","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-refractive-error-quality-life-qualitative-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.45,"score_history":{"1y":5.45,"6m":5.45,"3m":2,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":1527181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6799260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247748,"mean":13.012436033534,"rank":62996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":184422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247748,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":524,"mean":2.9805774378585,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":524,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.336,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"IN":2,"ES":1,"AU":1,"NP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OphthoMag\/statuses\/849251496655028224","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18485270],"posted_on":"2017-04-04T13:25:09+00:00","author":{"name":"The Ophthalmologist","url":"http:\/\/www.theophthalmologist.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/722443730549137408\/CeJXFvaK_normal.jpg","description":"Bringing you the latest in #ophthalmology, from the groundbreaking innovations to the personal stories.
