Recently, high body fat percentage (BF%) has been shown to be a cardiovascular risk factor. We therefore hypothesized that BF% variability would present a stronger cardiovascular risk than body weight variability.\nA single-center retrospective cohort study of medical check-up examinees aged 20 years or older at baseline (2005) was performed. Examinees were followed in 2007, 2009, and 2013-2014. BF% variability in 2005, 2007 and 2009 was calculated as the root-mean square error (RMSE) using a simple linear regression model. Multiple logistic regression models estimated the association between BF%-RMSE and new diagnoses of cardiovascular risk factors occurring between the 2009 and 2013-2014 visits.\nIn total, 11,281 participants (mean age: 51.3 years old, 48.8% were male) were included in this study. The average BF%-RMSE of our subjects was 0.63, and the average BMI-RMSE was 0.24. The high BF%-RMSE group (76-100th percentile) had a higher incidence of hypertension and a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus than the low BF%-RMSE group (1-25th percentile). This tendency was particularly evident in male participants. BMI-RMSE was not associated with any cardiovascular risks in our study.\nThis study indicates that body fat variability has contrasting effects on cardiovascular risk factors, while body weight variability has no significant effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yuki Saito","Osamu Takahashi","Hiroko Arioka","Daiki Kobayashi"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0175057","first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T13:21:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1491312087,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0175057"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0175057&type=printable","pmid":"28369119","pubdate":"2017-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0175057","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Associations between body fat variability and later onset of cardiovascular disease risk factors","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/associations-between-body-fat-variability-later-onset-cardiovascular-disease-risk-factors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":6113161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2040118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250797,"mean":13.082372334487,"rank":164381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":71484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250797,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116460,"mean":10.680239878412,"rank":79186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":31375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116460,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4613,"mean":10.42728707719,"rank":2934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4613,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"Associations between body fat variability and later onset of cardiovascular disease risk factors","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/citral\/comments\/638cgr\/associations_between_body_fat_variability_and\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[18485177],"posted_on":"2017-04-03T17:40:39+00:00","author":{"name":"officialcitral","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/citral","image":"http:\/\/a.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/gq9561mrzeY9TrVx.png","id_on_source":"citral","followers":21,"subreddit":"Centre for Investigative Research and Learning"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hockeyschtick1\/statuses\/849250562310909952","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18485177],"posted_on":"2017-04-04T13:21:27+00:00","author":{"name":"hockey schtick","url":"http:\/\/hockeyschtick.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000499975008\/0a6a1f29542ef6c2b329e124d68d28ee_normal.png","description":"The Hockey Schtick","id_on_source":"hockeyschtick1","tweeter_id":"125248034","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5554},"tweet_id":"849250562310909952"}]}}
