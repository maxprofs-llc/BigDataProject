Incident cases of EoE were diagnosed per consensus guidelines. At diagnosis and after 8 weeks of treatment, symptoms were measured using the VAS, LS and the Mayo Dysphagia Questionnaire (MDQ). The percentage change in scores before and after treatment were compared overall, in treatment responders (<15 eos\/hpf) and non-responders, and in patients without baseline dilation.\nIn 51 EoE cases, the median VAS decreased from 3.6 at baseline to 1.4 post-treatment (71% decrease), the LS decreased from 6 to 2 (67%) and the MDQ decreased from 20 to 10 (49%). The VAS correlated with both the LS (R = 0.77; P < 0.0001) and MDQ (R = 0.46, P = 0.001). After stratification by histological response, the LS decreased 70% in responders vs. 13% in non-responders (P = 0.02). In patients who did not receive baseline dilation, both the VAS and LS decreased significantly more in the histological responders.\nBoth the VAS and LS were responsive to successful treatment as measured by histologic improvement. Because the VAS and LS are simple to administer and are responsive to treatment, they can provide an efficient and objective method for assessing dysphagia severity in EoE in clinical practice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021d1","authors":["Reed, C.
