A total of three injections (3.3\u00a0mL each) were administered on each side by the same operator. Dissection was performed by a second operator 20\u00a0minutes later. Successful nerve staining was defined as the presence of dye on the nerve for a length of >1\u00a0cm.\nVentral branches of the T9, T10, T11, T12 and T13 nerves innervating the cranial abdominal wall were stained in 72%, 95%, 100%, 95% and 61% of cases, respectively. Ventral branches of L1 and L2 innervating the caudal abdominal wall were stained in only 33% and 11% of cases, respectively. The dye was found only in the fascia between the transversus abdominis and the internal oblique muscles.\nThe ultrasound-guided subcostal oblique TAP block provided adequate staining of the sensory innervation of the cranial abdominal wall. Further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of this technique in blocking the nociceptive response in clinical procedures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f7","authors":["Dro\u017cd\u017cy\u0144ska, Maja","Monticelli, Paolo","Neilson, David","Viscasillas, Jaime","Maja Dro\u017cd\u017cy\u0144ska","Paolo Monticelli","David Neilson","Jaime Viscasillas"],"doi":"10.1111\/vaa.12391","first_seen_on":"2016-05-28T11:05:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1467-2995","14672987"],"journal":"Veterinary Anaesthesia & Analgesia","last_mentioned_on":1487952005,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27232440?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vaa.12391\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1467298716313915"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vaa.12391\/pdf","pmid":"27232440","pubdate":"2016-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Ultrasound-guided subcostal oblique transversus abdominis plane block in canine cadavers","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/vaa.12391","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrasoundguided-subcostal-oblique-transversus-abdominis-plane-block-canine-cadavers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":6271831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1117297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272667,"mean":11.627108631072,"rank":188979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":47283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272667,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":512,"mean":1.0539138943249,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":512,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.54666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
