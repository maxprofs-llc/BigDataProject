The differentiation of Treg and Th17\u00a0cells was detected by flow cytometry. Levels of IL-23 receptor (IL-23R), STAT3, and phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) was examined by Western blot. The production of IL1, IL4, IL10, and IL-17 in DICs was measured by ELISA.\nExogenous recombinant human IL-23 significantly promoted the differentiation of Th17\u00a0cells from DICs, while anti-IL-23 antibody significantly promoted the differentiation of Treg cells from DICs. Consistent with the differentiation of Th17 and Tregs cells, levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17 correlated positively with IL-23 treatment, and anti-IL-23 antibody increased the secretion of IL-4 and IL-10 from DICs. Levels of pSTAT3, but not STAT3 or IL-23R, were significantly elevated by recombinant IL-23 treatment; anti-IL-23 antibody significantly decreased the levels of pSTAT3 and IL-23R in DICs.\nIL-23 mediates the differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells and the production of associated cytokines in DICs. The potential mechanism likely involves the STAT3 pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Cai, Jun-Ying","Li, Mu-Jun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2015.11.118","endpage":"344","first_seen_on":"2016-05-28T13:01:27+00:00","issns":["1090-2104","0006291X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1464449946,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26657845?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26657845","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"340","subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Interleukin 23 regulates the functions of human decidual immune cells during early pregnancy","type":"article","volume":"469","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interleukin-23-regulates-functions-human-decidual-immune-cells-during-early-pregnancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7822782,"mean":6.6331385505942,"rank":6775871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7822782,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269114,"mean":11.455888240256,"rank":224122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269114,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8344,"mean":2.7082044828,"rank":7202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8344,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225,"mean":4.0668482142857,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
