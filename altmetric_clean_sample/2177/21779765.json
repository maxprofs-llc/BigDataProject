CS begins as a hemodynamic problem with impaired cardiac output leading to reduced systemic perfusion, increased residual volume within the left and right ventricles, and increased cardiac filling pressures. A critical step towards the development of future algorithms is a clear understanding of the treatment objectives for CS. In this review, we introduce the \"door to support\" time as an emerging target of therapy to improve outcomes associated with CS, define four key treatment objectives in the management of CS, discuss the importance of early hemodynamic assessment and appropriate selection of acute mechanical circulatory support (AMCS) devices for CS, and introduce a classification scheme that identifies subtypes of CS based on cardiac filling pressures.","altmetric_jid":"55c212452a83ee1f7c8b4567","authors":["Michele L Esposito","Navin K Kapur"],"doi":"10.12688\/f1000research.11150.1","first_seen_on":"2017-07-11T19:14:01+00:00","issns":["2046-1402"],"journal":"F1000 Research","last_mentioned_on":1499756400,"links":["https:\/\/f1000research.com\/articles\/6-737\/v1"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/f1000research.com\/articles\/6-737\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC5443341","pmid":"28580136","pubdate":"2017-05-22T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Acute mechanical circulatory support for cardiogenic shock: the \u201cdoor to support\u201d time","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-mechanical-circulatory-support-cardiogenic-shock-door-support-time"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8193064,"mean":6.9264840328884,"rank":7089780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8193064,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177635,"mean":11.296425571681,"rank":144623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177635,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1836,"mean":10.425214168937,"rank":1716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":7.525494949495,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"F1000Research Article: Acute mechanical circulatory support for cardiogenic shock: the \u201cdoor to support\u201d time.","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1421576844577566&id=221578997910696","license":"public","citation_ids":[21779765],"posted_on":"2017-07-11T07:00:00+00:00","summary":"https:\/\/f1000research.com\/articles\/6-737\/v1","author":{"name":"T\u00fcrk Dahili ve Cerrahi Bilimler Yo\u011fun Bak\u0131m Derne\u011fi","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/221578997910696","facebook_wall_name":"T\u00fcrk Dahili ve Cerrahi Bilimler Yo\u011fun Bak\u0131m Derne\u011fi","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/221578997910696\/picture","id_on_source":"221578997910696"}}]}}
