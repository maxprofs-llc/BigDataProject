However, the key pathways for SECs still remain unambiguous. Unexpectedly, 11 new SECs and derivatives with diverse oxidation patterns were isolated after the deletion of gene 274. A high accumulation of toluquinol and its new glycosides in mutant \u0394276 and further isolation of the most crucial precursors farnesyl hydroquinone, farnesyl quinone, and three new derivatives from mutant \u0394278 confirm that farnesylation at toluquinol is the key step for SECs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Teng, Lin-Lin","Song, Tian-Yang","Xu, Zi-Fei","Liu, Xiao","Dai, Rong","Chen, Yong-Hong","Li, Sheng-Hong","Zhang, Ke-Qin","Niu, Xue-Mei"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.orglett.7b01846","first_seen_on":"2017-07-11T15:57:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1523-7060","1523-7052"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1499788624,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28692300?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28692300","pubdate":"2017-07-11T22:01:05+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Selected Mutations Revealed Intermediates and Key Precursors in the Biosynthesis of Polyketide\u2013Terpenoid Hybrid Sesquiterpenyl Epoxy-cyclohexenoids","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selected-mutations-revealed-intermediates-key-precursors-biosynthesis-polyketideterpenoid-hybrid-ses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8193064,"mean":6.9264840328884,"rank":6220208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1103378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8193064,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177746,"mean":11.289759824468,"rank":125324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":33058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177746,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3876,"mean":3.3991468387097,"rank":2767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3876,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":3.382776119403,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
