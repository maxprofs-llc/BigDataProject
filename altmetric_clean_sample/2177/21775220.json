In order to avoid mistaken description of species, the approach of integrative taxonomy recommends to consider multidisciplinary lines of evidence, including ecology. Unfortunately, ecological data are often difficult to quantify in an objective way. Here we test and discuss the potential use of Ecological Niche Models for validating taxa boundaries, using three pairs of closely related plant taxa endemic to South-western Alps as a case study. We also discuss on the application of Ecological Niche Models for species delimitation and on the implementation of different approaches. Niche overlap, niche equivalency and niche similarity were assessed both in a multidimensional environmental space and in a geographical space to look for differences in the niche of three pairs of closely related plant taxa. We detected a high degree of niche differentiation between taxa although this result seems not due to difference in habitat selection. The different statistical tests showed contrasting outcomes between environmental and geographical spaces. According to our results, the niche divergence seems not to support taxa boundaries at species level, but it may have had important consequences for local adaptation and in generating phenotypic diversity at the intraspecific level. Environmental space analysis should be preferred to geographical space one by having more clear results. Even if the different analyses widely disagree on their conclusion about taxa boundaries, our study suggests that Ecological Niche Models may help taxonomists in reaching a decision.
