They are usually inflammatory in nature and may be encountered as Leser-Tr\u00e9lat sign. ESK may also be simultaneously observed with hepatic angiomas, chemotherapy, segmental neurofibromatosis, HIV or erythrodermic pityriasis rubra pilaris, psoriasis, and drug eruption. ESK may be transient and self-healing. Others recede after successful treatment of the underlying disease. In some instances, seborrheic keratoses may follow an isotopic response and remain strictly restricted to sites of previous eczema, photo-exposition or tattoos. A patient with patch\/plaque lesions of classic-type mycosis fungoides (MF) presented sudden ESK that were exclusively limited to the MF lesions. In conclusion, this patient combined an isotopic response and ESK.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006df6","authors":["Eve Lebas","Pascale Quatresooz","Jorge\u00a0E. Arrese","Arjen\u00a0F.
