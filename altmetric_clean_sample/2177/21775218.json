The rate constant for \u03b2-hematin formation mediated by monopalmitoyl-rac-glycerol was reduced from 0.17 \u00b1 0.04 min-1 previously measured in Falcon tubes to 0.019 \u00b1 0.002 min-1 in the optimized assay. While this necessitated longer incubation times, transferring aliquots from multiple 24-well plates to a single 96-well plate for final absorbance measurements actually improved the overall turnaround time per inhibitor. This assay has been applied to investigate the effects of four clinically-relevant antimalarial drugs (chloroquine, amodiaquine, quinidine and quinine) as well as several short-chain 4-aminoquinoline derivatives and non-quinoline (benzamide) compounds on the kinetics of \u03b2-hematin formation. The adsorption strength of these inhibitors to crystalline \u03b2-hematin (Kads) was quantified using a theoretical kinetic model that is based on the Avrami equation and the Langmuir isotherm. Statistically-significant linear correlations between lipid-mediated \u03b2-hematin inhibitory activity and Kads values for quinoline (r2 = 0.76, P-value = 0.0046) and non-quinoline compounds (r2 = 0.99, P-stat = 0.0006), as well as between parasite inhibitory activity (D10) and Kads values for quinoline antimalarial drugs and short-chain chloroquine derivatives (r2 = 0.64, P-value = 0.0098) provides a strong indication that drug action involves adsorption to the surface of \u03b2-hematin crystals. Independent support in this regard is provided by experiments that spectrophotometrically monitor the direct adsorption of antimalarial drugs to pre-formed \u03b2-hematin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Fitzroy, Sharne-Mare","Gildenhuys, Johandie","Olivier, Tania","Tshililo, Ndivhuwo Olga","Kuter, David","de Villiers, Katherine Allison","Sharn\u00e9-Mar\u00e9 Fitzroy","Johandie Gildenhuys","Tania Olivier","Ndivhuwo Olga Tshililo","David Kuter","Katherine Allison de Villiers"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.langmuir.7b01132","first_seen_on":"2017-07-11T15:41:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0743-7463","1520-5827"],"journal":"Langmuir","last_mentioned_on":1501180801,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28689414?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.langmuir.7b01132?utm_content=bufferdc3bb&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"28689414","pubdate":"2017-07-11T22:04:52+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"The Effects of Quinoline and Non-quinoline Inhibitors on the Kinetics of Lipid-mediated \u03b2-Hematin Crystallization","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-quinoline-nonquinoline-inhibitors-kinetics-lipidmediated-%CE%B2hematin-crystallization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282957,"mean":6.9842712712639,"rank":6284117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1120223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282957,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214694,"mean":11.637919457085,"rank":151647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":39195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214694,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2867,"mean":2.8548583391486,"rank":1627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2867,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":1.0438461538462,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/statuses\/884799724645105665","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21775218],"posted_on":"2017-07-11T15:41:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
