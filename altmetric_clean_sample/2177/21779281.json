Three-month follow-up data were reviewed for all these patients, who received all their care from a single geographically isolated health maintenance organization.\nThree-month rate of symptomatic VTE and clinical outcomes after an initially normal single proximal US result.\nOf 1295 patients, 111 (8.6%) were found to have acute deep venous thrombosis on the initial proximal US. Of the remaining 1184 patients with initially normal results on proximal US who were sampled at 3-month follow-up, 1075 patients (90.8%) had no venous thromboembolic event. Among the others, 11 (0.9%) had a subsequent imaging-confirmed venous thromboembolic event, 53 (4.5%) died (none owing to venous thromboembolism), and 45 (3.8%) did not complete follow-up.\nSymptomatic VTE after an initially normal single proximal US result occurred in less than 1% of this cohort. Therefore, serial proximal US is unnecessary for most of our patients, and its elimination will save time and out-of-pocket expenses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6333cf058f6100084a5","authors":["Myles Mitsunaga"],"doi":"10.7812\/tpp\/16-140","first_seen_on":"2017-07-11T18:44:18+00:00","issns":["1552-5775","15525767","15525775"],"journal":"The Permanente Journal","last_mentioned_on":1499798646,"links":["http:\/\/www.thepermanentejournal.org\/issues\/2017\/6382-venous-thromboembolism.html"],"pmid":"28406789","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine","healthservices"],"title":"Risk of Venous Thromboembolism after a Single Normal Proximal Lower Extremity Venous Ultrasound","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-venous-thromboembolism-after-single-normal-proximal-lower-extremity-venous-ultrasound"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8193064,"mean":6.9264840328884,"rank":5928771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1973075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8193064,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177807,"mean":11.286056488532,"rank":114729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":52472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177807,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":418,"mean":8.8192853717026,"rank":279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":418,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.85,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PermanenteJ\/statuses\/884845772616761344","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21779281],"posted_on":"2017-07-11T18:44:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Permanente Journal","url":"http:\/\/www.thepermanentejournal.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1245337108\/Wntr11cvr_normal.jpg","description":"The Permanente Journal advances knowledge in scientific research, clinical medicine, and innovative health care delivery.","id_on_source":"PermanenteJ","tweeter_id":"248796248","geo":{"lt":45.52345,"ln":-122.67621,"country":"US"},"followers":430},"tweet_id":"884845772616761344"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Risk of Venous Thromboembolism after a Single Normal Proximal Lower Extremity Venous Ultrasound","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=812739745553604&id=286903368137247","license":"public","citation_ids":[21779281],"posted_on":"2017-07-11T18:44:01+00:00","summary":"Risk of Venous Thromboembolism after a Single Normal Proximal Lower Extremity Venous Ultrasound","author":{"name":"The Permanente Journal","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/286903368137247","facebook_wall_name":"The Permanente Journal","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/286903368137247\/picture","id_on_source":"286903368137247"}}]}}
