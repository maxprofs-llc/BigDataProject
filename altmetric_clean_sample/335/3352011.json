All four had QT prolongation over 500 ms, two had rate-dependent bundle branch block, two developed torsades de pointes, and one died after cardiac arrest. Pending further studies, we recommend electrocardiogram assessment until at least 16 h after amisulpride overdose and, if QT interval is prolonged, cardiac monitoring until the patient is clinically well and conduction intervals are normal.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008129","authors":["Isbister GK","Murray L","John S","Hackett LP","Haider T","O'Mullane P","Gosselin S","Daly F"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T17:16:33+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Medical Journal of Australia","last_mentioned_on":1264671077,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16584372","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16584372"],"pmid":"16584372","pubdate":"2006-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Amisulpride deliberate self-poisoning causing severe cardiac toxicity including QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amisulpride-deliberate-selfpoisoning-causing-severe-cardiac-toxicity-including-qt-prolongation-torsa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7365922,"mean":6.3985095588144,"rank":1761183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4624931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7365922,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233041,"mean":8.0334293168556,"rank":65236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":163655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233041,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1371,"mean":9.5867430656934,"rank":533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1371,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":10.8675,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
