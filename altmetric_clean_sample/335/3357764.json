Keissler concerning place of their isolation and ecologic peculiarities are presented in the paper. Essential differences, as to all studied indices of the strains of C. sphaerospermum strains, isolated from premices of the ChNPP 4th unit from the control strains of this species have been established. Only strain 34 of C. sphaerospermum, isolated from the cable driving region of the \"Shelter\" object, which did not differ from the control strains as to all the studied indices, made the exception. The radial growth rate was 2-4 times as low and variability amplitude 10-30 times as high in strains 60 and 5-1 of C. sphaerospermum, (which suffered high radiation load), as in the control strains of this species. The radial growth rate of C. sphaerospermum studied strains was an order lower as a whole than that of A. alternata strains. All the above said evidence for implementation of K-type vital strategy by C. sphaerospermum species and in this connection one can suppose its active growth on the surface of walls and ferroconcrete structures of the ChNPP 4th unit. Absence of differences, as to the studied radial growth indices, between A. alternata strains isolated from the ChNPP 4th unit premices and control strains of the species can evidence for the existence of A. alternata species under the conditions of high radioactivity in the surviving state.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce4e","authors":["V V Vember","N N Zhdanova"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T19:38:00+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1028-0987"],"issue":"3","journal":"Mikrobiolohichny\u012d zhurnal Mikrobiologichny zhurnal","last_mentioned_on":1314032554,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11785260"],"pmid":"11785260","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"[Peculiarities of linear growth of the melanin-containing fungi Cladosporium sphaerospermum Penz. and Alternaria alternata (Fr.)
