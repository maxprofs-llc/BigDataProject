We have cloned a corepressor, KAP-1, which associates with the KRAB domain but not with KRAB mutants that have lost repression activity. KAP-1 can enhance KRAB-mediated repression and is a repressor when directly tethered to DNA. KAP-1 contains a RING finger, B boxes, and a PHD finger; the RING-B1-B2 structure is required for KRAB binding and corepression. We propose that KAP-1 may be a universal corepressor for the large family of KRAB domain-containing transcription factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["J R Friedman","W J Fredericks","D E Jensen","D W Speicher","X P Huang","E G Neilson","F J Rauscher"],"doi":"10.1101\/gad.10.16.2067","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T18:49:04+00:00","issns":["1549-5477","0890-9369"],"journal":"Genes & Development","last_mentioned_on":1374126597,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1101\/gad.10.16.2067","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8769649"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/genesdev.cshlp.org\/content\/10\/16\/2067.full.pdf","pmid":"8769649","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"KAP-1, a novel corepressor for the highly conserved KRAB repression domain.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kap1-novel-corepressor-highly-conserved-krab-repression-domain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4475808,"mean":4.7807918521955,"rank":983924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2919441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4475808,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148011,"mean":7.4970031349234,"rank":39020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":107182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148011,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2759,"mean":3.0939535895576,"rank":520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2759,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":5.8405405405405,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
