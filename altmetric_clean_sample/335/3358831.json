However, recent studies suggest that symptoms of nicotine dependence can occur early in the onset process, raising questions about the validity of this model. The objective of our study was to describe the sequence and timing of 12 milestones (6 related to cigarette use and 6 to symptoms of nicotine dependence) during onset of cigarette use.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000dcd","authors":["Andr\u00e9 Gervais","Jennifer O'Loughlin","Garbis Meshefedjian","Christina Bancej","Mich\u00e8le Tremblay"],"doi":"10.1503\/cmaj.051235","endpage":"261","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T20:03:32+00:00","issns":["1488-2329","0820-3946"],"issue":"3","journal":"Canadian Medical Association Journal","last_mentioned_on":1478191006,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1503\/cmaj.051235","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16880445","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1513423","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1513423"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cmaj.ca\/content\/175\/3\/255.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1513423","pmid":"16880445","pubdate":"2006-07-31T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Canadian Medical Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"255","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Milestones in the natural course of onset of cigarette use among adolescents","type":"article","volume":"175","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/milestones-natural-course-onset-cigarette-among-adolescents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8096639,"mean":6.890087373789,"rank":1316935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6699340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8096639,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239028,"mean":8.2591667886891,"rank":46423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":192324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239028,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4608,"mean":18.381221619275,"rank":1546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4608,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":26.800096153846,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
