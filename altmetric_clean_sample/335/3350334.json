Increased insertion of postsynaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) appears to be crucial for CA1 LTP. However, the mechanism underlying AMPAR insertion during LTP remains largely unknown. We now report that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is complexed with AMPARs at synapses and activated by selective stimulation of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Activation of the AMPAR-associated PI3K is required for the increased cell surface expression of AMPARs and LTP. Thus, our results strongly suggest that the AMPAR-PI3K complex may constitute a critical molecular signal responsible for AMPAR insertion at activated CA1 synapses during LTP, and consequently, this lipid kinase may serve to determine the polarity of NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Man, Heng-Ye","Wang, Qinhua","Lu, Wei-Yang","Ju, William","Ahmadian, Gholamreza","Liu, Lidong","D'Souza, Sandra","Wong, T P","Taghibiglou, C","Lu, Jie","Becker, Larry E","Pei, Lin","Liu, Fang","Wymann, Matthias P","MacDonald, John F","Wang, Yu Tian"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0896-6273(03)00228-9","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T16:31:39+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0896-6273"],"issue":"4","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1453758674,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0896627303002289","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0896-6273(03)00228-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12765612"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0896627303002289\/pdf","pmid":"12765612","pubdate":"2017-07-03T13:51:46+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Activation of PI3-kinase is required for AMPA receptor insertion during LTP of mEPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activation-pi3kinase-required-ampa-receptor-insertion-during-ltp-mepscs-cultured-hippocampal-neurons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7028853,"mean":6.2639093712573,"rank":655855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6345800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7028853,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231214,"mean":7.9680439681161,"rank":28535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":201920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231214,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4562,"mean":17.676578820434,"rank":1326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":3218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4562,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":36.26006741573,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Researcher":29,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
