The concentration of vinpocetine producing 50% inhibition of Ca2+-dependent phosphodiesterase activity was approximately 21 microM, both in the presence and absence of Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM). Increasing the concentration of CaM in the presence of Ca2+ did not prevent vinpocetine-induced inhibition of Ca2+-dependent phosphodiesterase, thereby indicating that vinpocetine inhibited the enzyme by interacting with the enzyme and not with CaM. To determine the influence of vinpocetine-induced inhibition of Ca2+-dependent phosphodiesterase on cyclic nucleotide metabolism in vascular smooth muscle, cyclic nucleotide levels in isolated rabbit aortic strips were also investigated. Addition of vinpocetine produced dose-dependent increases in only the cyclic GMP levels and there was no significant effects on the cyclic AMP levels. These results provide pharmacological evidence that Ca2+-dependent phosphodiesterase mainly hydrolyzes cyclic GMP in vascular smooth muscle. Vinpocetine may induce vascular relaxation by increasing cyclic GMP contents in vascular smooth muscle through selective inhibition of Ca2+-dependent phosphodiesterase.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c2","authors":["M Hagiwara","T Endo","H Hidaka"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T20:27:24+00:00","issns":["0006-2952"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1257151994,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6322804"],"pmid":"6322804","pubdate":"1984-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Effects of vinpocetine on cyclic nucleotide metabolism in vascular smooth muscle.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-vinpocetine-cyclic-nucleotide-metabolism-vascular-smooth-muscle-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632750,"mean":4.9231796234803,"rank":815918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632750,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94367,"mean":8.1265328402181,"rank":24536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94367,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1107,"mean":4.952705244123,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1107,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.5375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Vinpocetine","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=323440702#altmetric_citation_9","license":"public","citation_ids":[3359928,3359930],"posted_on":"2009-11-02T08:53:14+00:00","summary":"Vinpocetine (brand names: Cavinton, Intelectol; chemical name: ethyl apovincaminate) is a semisynthetic derivative of the vinca alkaloid vincamine (sometimes described as &quot;a synthetic ethyl ester of apovincamine&quot;), an extract from the lesser peri","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=4329032","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Chris Capoccia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Chris Capoccia"}}]}}
