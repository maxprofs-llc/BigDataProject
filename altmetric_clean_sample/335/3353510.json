A group of nine congenitally blind children with an autism-like syndrome were closely matched on chronological age and verbal mental age with nine sighted autistic children, and were compared on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (Schopler, Reichler, & Renner, 1986) and the Behavior Checklist for Disordered Preschoolers, together with the Play Items for Disordered Preschoolers (Sherman, Shapiro, & Glassman, 1983). A checklist of clinical features characteristic of autism (derived from DSM-III-R) was also completed through an interview with teachers. There was substantial similarity between the groups, but also suggestive evidence of possible group differences, specifically in the domain of social-emotional responsiveness. Research on the psychological development of congenitally blind children promises to yield insights into the nature of autism itself.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb4","authors":["R P Hobson","A Lee","R Brown"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T17:55:11+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0162-3257"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1444978320,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10097994"],"pmid":"10097994","pubdate":"1999-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Autism and congenital blindness.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autism-congenital-blindness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.52,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.52},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6258277,"mean":5.9890807040159,"rank":535355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":5723281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6258277,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190643,"mean":8.6471669936322,"rank":23821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":166820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190643,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1998,"mean":8.4859469203806,"rank":391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":1600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1998,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":10.138666666667,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
