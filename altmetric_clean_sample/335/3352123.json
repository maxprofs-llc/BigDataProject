It is approved for the treatment of asthma in the EU and Japan, and is the first once-daily ICS\/LABA to be available for this indication. Fluticasone furoate is an enhanced-affinity glucocorticoid receptor agonist, with potent anti-inflammatory activity. Vilanterol produces rapid and prolonged bronchodilation. In phase III trials in adolescents and adults with various levels of asthma uncontrolled on ICS and\/or ICS\/LABA, fluticasone furoate\/vilanterol 100\/25 or 200\/25\u00a0\u00b5g once daily (approved dosages in the EU) significantly improved pulmonary function compared with placebo or equivalent dosages of fluticasone furoate alone (in some trials) or fluticasone propionate. In similar trials, fluticasone furoate\/vilanterol 100\/25\u00a0\u00b5g once daily was as effective as fluticasone propionate\/salmeterol 250\/50\u00a0\u00b5g twice daily in improving pulmonary function and significantly reduced the risk of severe asthma exacerbation relative to fluticasone furoate alone. In clinical trials, fluticasone furoate\/vilanterol was generally well tolerated with fewer than 15\u00a0% of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events, the most common of which were oral\/oropharyngeal candidiasis, dysphonia, extrasystoles and cough. The tolerability profile of fluticasone furoate\/vilanterol was generally similar to that of fluticasone propionate\/salmeterol. Thus, fluticasone furoate\/vilanterol is an effective and generally well tolerated ICS\/LABA option for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002738","authors":["Yahiya Y Syed"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40265-015-0354-5","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T17:18:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0012-6667","1179-1950"],"journal":"Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1451992626,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25648266?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40265-015-0354-5"],"pmid":"25648266","pubdate":"2015-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacotherapy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Fluticasone Furoate\/Vilanterol: a Review of Its Use in Patients with Asthma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fluticasone-furoatevilanterol-review-patients-asthma-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":3122777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3728322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230431,"mean":7.9509481925098,"rank":101369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":126770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230431,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1241,"mean":3.4039274193548,"rank":831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1241,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.7466666666667,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
