This indicates that the analgesic effect of the combination represents the additive effect of its constituents and is consistent with the assumption that these constituents are producing analgesia by different mechanisms. 3 Although significantly superior to placebo, codeine seemed to be inferior to the other treatments. 4 Compared with placebo, both codeine and hydrocodone (centrally acting narcotics) seemed relatively more effective in uterine cramp than episiotomy pain; the reverse seemed true with acetaminophen (a peripherally acting analgesic). 5 Some methodological implications for the evaluation of analgesic combinations are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243e","authors":["W T Beaver","D McMillan"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T19:04:14+00:00","issns":["0306-5251"],"journal":"British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1259343396,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7192153","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1430165"],"pmcid":"PMC1430165","pmid":"7192153","pubdate":"1980-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Methodological considerations in the evaluation of analgesic combinations: acetaminophen (paracetamol) and hydrocodone in postpartum pain.","type":"article","volume":"10 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methodological-considerations-evaluation-analgesic-combinations-acetaminophen-paracetamol-hydrocodon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4093361,"mean":5.0977156158875,"rank":951034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2579906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4093361,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128768,"mean":9.0555612074524,"rank":39427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":87541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128768,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1288,"mean":4.3201958041958,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1288,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":4.1315789473684,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
