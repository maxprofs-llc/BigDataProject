Mammals, however, have lost the capacity for continuous tooth renewal seen in most other vertebrates, and typically have only 1-2 generations of teeth. Here, we review the mechanisms of tooth replacement in reptiles and mammals, and discuss in detail the current and historical theories on control of timing and pattern of tooth replacement and development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa91d3cf058f61000d4bc","authors":["John A Whitlock","Joy M Richman"],"doi":"10.1038\/ijos.2013.36","endpage":"70","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T17:59:53+00:00","issns":["1674-2818","2049-3169"],"journal":"International journal of oral science","last_mentioned_on":1480833111,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijos\/journal\/v5\/n2\/full\/ijos201336a.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ijos.2013.36"],"pmid":"23788284","pubdate":"2013-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"66","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Biology of tooth replacement in amniotes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biology-tooth-replacement-amniotes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":1782889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6028429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236914,"mean":8.1254949876116,"rank":61491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":174285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236914,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":2.1114285714286,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.7666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
