Thereby, epigenetic silencing of the 14-3-3sigma gene was detected in the cell line LNCaP. 14-3-3sigma encodes a p53-regulated inhibitor of cell cycle progression. Laser microdissection was used to isolate different cell types present in diseased prostatic tissue. Subsequent methylation-specific PCR analysis showed CpG methylation of 14-3-3sigma in all 41 primary PCa samples analysed, which was accompanied by a decrease or loss of 14-3-3sigma protein expression. In contrast, normal prostate epithelial and benign prostate hyperplasia cells showed high levels of 14-3-3sigma expression. PCa-precursor lesions (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) also displayed decreased levels of 14-3-3sigma expression in luminal cells, which are known to contain shortened telomeres. RNA interference-mediated inactivation of 14-3-3sigma compromised a DNA damage-induced G(2)\/M arrest in the PCa cell line PC3. The generality of CpG methylation and downregulation of 14-3-3sigma expression in PCa suggests that it significantly contributes to the formation of PCa, potentially by allowing the escape from a DNA damage-induced arrest elicited by telomere shortening.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","authors":["Dimitri Lodygin","Dimitri Lodygin","Joachim Diebold","Heiko Hermeking"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.onc.1208004","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T17:15:17+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1423058648,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.onc.1208004"],"pmid":"15489902","pubdate":"2004-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Prostate cancer is characterized by epigenetic silencing of 14-3-3|[sigma]| expression","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prostate-cancer-characterized-epigenetic-silencing-1433sigma-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4715210,"mean":5.6976580270372,"rank":2507790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1565148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4715210,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164398,"mean":8.7791515660265,"rank":86900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":57244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164398,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3292,"mean":3.1993521725919,"rank":2187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3292,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":2.8762784810127,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
