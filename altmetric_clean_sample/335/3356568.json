At a given ventilation, women have a greater work of breathing compared with men, and because work is linearly related to oxygen uptake we hypothesized that their oxygen cost of breathing would also be greater. For a given ventilation, women had a greater absolute oxygen cost of breathing, and this represented a greater fraction of total oxygen uptake. Regardless of sex, those who developed expiratory flow limitation had a greater oxygen cost of breathing at maximal exercise. The greater oxygen cost of breathing in women indicates that a greater fraction of total oxygen uptake (and possibly cardiac output) is directed to the respiratory muscles, which may influence blood flow distribution during exercise.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df5","authors":["Dominelli PB","Render JN","Molgat-Seon Y","Foster GE","Romer LM","Sheel AW","Paolo B Dominelli","Jacqueline N Render","Yannick Molgat-Seon","Glen E Foster","Lee M Romer","A William Sheel","Dominelli, Paolo B.","Render, Jacqueline N.","Molgat\u2010Seon, Yannick","Foster, Glen E.","Romer, Lee M.","Sheel, A.
