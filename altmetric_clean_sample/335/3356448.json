Bench tests and latex agglutination were compared with molecular identification. Using bench tests and latex agglutination alone, 100% (30\/30) of B. pseudomallei isolates were correctly identified. Amoxicillin-clavulanate susceptibility testing was also a good and simple discriminatory test.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Kelly Hodgson","Cathy Engler","Brenda Govan","Natkunam Ketheesan","Robert Norton","Hodgson K","Engler C","Govan B","Ketheesan N","Norton R"],"doi":"10.1128\/jcm.02507-08","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T19:06:39+00:00","issns":["1098-660X","0095-1137"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1237118589,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JCM.02507-08","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19279182","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2681847"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/content\/47\/5\/1578.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2681847","pmid":"19279182","pubdate":"2009-05-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Comparison of Routine Bench and Molecular Diagnostic Methods in Identification of Burkholderia pseudomallei","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-routine-bench-molecular-diagnostic-methods-identification-burkholderia-pseudomallei"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":816833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93826,"mean":8.0814792006397,"rank":24292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93826,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2433,"mean":2.5924169407895,"rank":296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2433,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":1.8090909090909,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
