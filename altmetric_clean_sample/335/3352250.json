The risk of cross intolerance reaction between 5-ASA and 4-ASA has currently never been evaluated. We report three cases of 5-ASA-induced pancreatitis, with no recurrence of pancreatitis during subsequent treatment with 4-ASA enemas. We conclude that 4-ASA enemas are a safe and well-tolerated therapeutic alternative whenever 5-ASA-induced pancreatitis occurs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007774","authors":["Daniel F","Seksik P","Cacheux W","Jian R","Marteau P"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T17:21:42+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1223630274,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15290921"],"pmid":"15290921","pubdate":"2004-08-04T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Tolerance of 4-aminosalicylic acid enemas in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 5-aminosalicylic-induced acute pancreatitis.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tolerance-4aminosalicylic-acid-enemas-patients-inflammatory-bowel-disease-5aminosalicylicinduced-acu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":816559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93883,"mean":8.0910300803138,"rank":24312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93883,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":907,"mean":2.5745055187638,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":907,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":3.2594838709677,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"4-Aminosalicylic acid","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=244337072#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3352249,3352250],"posted_on":"2008-10-10T09:17:54+00:00","summary":"4-aminosalicylic acid, commonly known as PAS, is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=2715981","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Gak","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Gak"}}]}}
