To date no guidelines for treatment of PG have been established far. The aim of the study was to provide an evidence-based review of the literature and an evaluation of recommendations for PG treatment. We performed an electronic search using the PubMed database and the term \"pyoderma-gangrenosum.\" Literature published in the English language during the past two decades was reviewed. All relevant studies that could be obtained regardless of the study design were evaluated for grades of recommendation and levels of evidence. Data on patient characteristics including severity of the disease, localization of lesions, associated diseases, and treatment procedures were abstracted and evaluated for therapeutic outcome. We conclude that therapeutic efficacy of systemic treatment with corticosteroids and cyclosporine is best documented in the literature for disseminated as well as for localized disease and should be considered first-line therapy. In cases that do not respond to this treatment, we recommend alternative therapeutic procedures (eg, systemic treatment with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil; mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine; tacrolimus; infliximab; or plasmapheresis), considering additional factors including associated diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8d","doi":"10.1016\/j.jaad.2004.10.006","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T20:15:28+00:00","issns":["0190-9622"],"journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1187215385,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jaad.2004.10.006","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16021123"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jaad.org\/article\/S0190962204027379\/pdf","pmid":"16021123","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Treatment recommendations for pyoderma gangrenosum: an evidence-based review of the literature based on more than 350 patients.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-recommendations-pyoderma-gangrenosum-evidencebased-review-literature-based-more-350-patien"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629536,"mean":4.93415564694,"rank":816453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629536,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93923,"mean":8.0939581993571,"rank":24331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93923,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1828,"mean":2.6963360700602,"rank":271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1828,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":2.5076923076923,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
