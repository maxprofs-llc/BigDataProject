The extent to which the biota support this hypothesis of greater oceanicity have been debated. Here, Pemba's terrestrial mollusc (\"land-snail\") fauna is surveyed and reviewed for the first time. We find at best equivocal evidence for the following hallmarks of greater oceanicity: impoverishment, imbalance, and a high rate of endemism. At least 49 species are present, families are represented in typical proportions, and there are only between two and four island-endemic species - i.e. a 4% to 8% rate of endemism. For land-snails, isolation thus seems to have been short (Pleistocene) or, if longer, weak. Nevertheless, Pemba does host endemic and globally rare species. Forty-five percent of the species found, including most of these, is restricted to forest reserves, with Ngezi Forest Reserve particularly rich. A further 45% are able to tolerate the island's woody cultivated habitats. One new snail species (Cyclophoridae: Cyathopoma) and one new slug species (Urocyclidae: Dendrolimax pro tem.) are described. New data and illustrations are provided for other taxa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["Ben Rowson","Ben Rowson"," Ben Warren"," Christine Ngereza"],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.70.762","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T16:36:52+00:00","issns":["1313-2970"],"journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1341081157,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/zookeys.70.762"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/lib\/ajax_srv\/generate_pdf.php?readonly_preview=1&document_id=2471","pmid":"21594041","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Terrestrial molluscs of Pemba Island, Zanzibar, Tanzania, and its status as an \u201coceanic\u201d island","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/terrestrial-molluscs-pemba-island-zanzibar-tanzania-status-oceanic-island"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3892090,"mean":5.0222727359687,"rank":892339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2464694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3892090,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119432,"mean":9.0301359369638,"rank":35663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":82303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119432,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1225,"mean":10.91399017199,"rank":473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1225,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":5.96375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
