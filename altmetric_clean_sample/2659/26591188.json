Three-layer reconstruction with the iliotibial tract (TRITT) is a safe and reliable alternative when vascularized flaps are not available.\nThe iliotibial tract graft is harvested on the lateral aspect of the thigh and divided in three portions, which are positioned in a multi-layered fashion to close the skull base defect. The first layer is disposed intracranial intradural, the second intracranial extradural, and the third extracranial. Fat grafts from thigh subcutaneous tissue are placed between the second and third layer to fill the dead space between them. Use of fibrin glue and intradural irrigation may help the surgeon to stabilize the layers during reconstruction.\nTRITT is a feasible, highly reproducible, safe, and always available option for reconstruction of anterior skull base defects after ERTC for naso-ethmoidal tumors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d13","authors":["Davide Mattavelli","Alberto Schreiber","Marco Ferrari","Remo Accorona","Andrea Bolzoni Villaret","Paolo Battaglia","Paolo Castelnuovo","Piero Nicolai"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.wneu.2017.02.066","first_seen_on":"2017-09-26T10:27:52+00:00","issns":["18788750"],"journal":"World Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1506421655,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28254539?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28254539","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Three-Layer Reconstruction with Iliotibial Tract After Endoscopic Resection of Sinonasal Tumors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threelayer-reconstruction-iliotibial-tract-after-endoscopic-resection-sinonasal-tumors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":4523063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2357828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114523,"mean":11.475485042176,"rank":61176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":41332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114523,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1105,"mean":2.9694637681159,"rank":358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1105,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.7965909090909,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SnotDocs\/statuses\/912624683987562496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26591188],"posted_on":"2017-09-26T10:27:35+00:00","author":{"name":"SnotBot","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/912538967555190784\/2RhASFcF_normal.jpg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Rhinology papers in #PubMed","id_on_source":"SnotDocs","tweeter_id":"912534858718519296","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":0},"tweet_id":"912624683987562496"}]}}
