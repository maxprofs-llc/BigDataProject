Strain UM270 exhibits excellent biocontrol capacities against diverse fungal pathogens . In a previous study, the general UM270 genome characteristics were published. Here, we report a deeper analysis of its gene content and compare it to other P. fluorescens strains to unveil the genetic elements that might explain UM270's great colonizing and plant growth-promoting capabilities. Our analyses found high variation in genome size and gene content among the eight Pseudomonas genomes analyzed (strains UM270, Pf0-1, A506, F113, SBW25, PICF-7, UK4 and UW4). A core genome of 3,039 coding DNA sequences (CDSs) was determined, with 599 CDSs present only in the UM270 genome. From these unique UM270 genes, a set of 192 CDSs was found to be involved in signaling, rhizosphere colonization and competence, highlighted as important traits to achieve an effective biocontrol and plant growth promotion.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef552a83ee09648b4b40","authors":["Julie E.
