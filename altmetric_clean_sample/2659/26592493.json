The present study investigated age\u2011associated differences in CB, CR and PV immunoreactivities in the somatosensory cortex in three species (mice, rats and gerbils) of young (1\u00a0month), adult (6\u00a0months) and aged (24\u00a0months) rodents, using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Abundant CB\u2011immunoreactive neurons were distributed in layers II and III, and age\u2011associated alterations in their number were different according to the species. CR\u2011immunoreactive neurons were not abundant in all layers; however, the number of CR\u2011immunoreactive neurons was the highest in all adult species. Many PV\u2011immunoreactive neurons were identified in all layers, particularly in layers II and III, and they increased in all layers with age in all species. The present study demonstrated that the distribution pattern of CB\u2011, CR\u2011 and PV\u2011containing neurons in the somatosensory cortex were apparently altered in number with normal aging, and that CB and CR exhibited a tendency to decrease in aged rodents, whereas PV tended to increase with age. These results indicate that CB, CR and PV are markedly altered in the somatosensory cortex, and this change may be associated with normal aging. These findings may aid the elucidation of the mechanisms of aging and geriatric disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Ji Ahn","Seongkweon Hong","Joon Park","In Kim","Jeong Cho","Tae\u2011Kyeong Lee","Jae\u2011Chul Lee","Bai Chen","Bich\u2011Na Shin","Eun Bae","Yong Jeon","Young\u2011Myeong Kim","Moo\u2011Ho Won","Soo Choi"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2017.7573","first_seen_on":"2017-09-26T11:03:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1791-2997","1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1506423813,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28944879?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28944879","pubdate":"2017-09-21T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Immunoreactivities of calbindin\u2011D28k, calretinin and parvalbumin in the somatosensory cortex of rodents during normal aging","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":4523064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2357827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114522,"mean":11.47583105282,"rank":61176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":41332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114522,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2231,"mean":1.7200950672646,"rank":394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":1565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2231,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":4.1044247787611,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TC_papers\/statuses\/912633735383674880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26592493],"posted_on":"2017-09-26T11:03:33+00:00","author":{"name":"TC_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507539334375829504\/IcPjrJI3_normal.jpeg","description":"Pubmed twitterbot: arealization OR patterning OR somatosensory OR thalamus OR thalamocortical OR cortical development","id_on_source":"TC_papers","tweeter_id":"2789910212","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":179},"tweet_id":"912633735383674880"}]}}
