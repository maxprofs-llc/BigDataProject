Among those alterations, inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity, increased free radical production and reduced antioxidant responses have been reported. Copper (Cu) plays an important role in the metabolism and antioxidative responses through its participation as a cofactor in the cytochrome c oxidase enzyme (COX), Cu\/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu\/Zn-SOD), and metallothioneins. We tested the effect of copper sulfate (CuSO4) pretreatment on the mitochondrial electron transport chain (METC) in the striatum after MPP(+) toxicity in rats. The results showed that the MPP(+) intrastriatal injection reduced mitochondrial complex I, II, IV and V activities; while 10\u00a0\u03bcmol of CuSO4 pretreatment counteracted this damage. Activities of complexes I, II and IV, were coincident with ATP recovery. Moreover, Cu\/Zn-SOD activity was reduced as a consequence of MPP(+) damage; however, copper pre-treatment kept the striatal Cu\/Zn-SOD activity unchanged in MPP(+)-damaged animals. We observed that MPP(+) also reduced the metallothionein (MT) content and that CuSO4 pretreatment maintained baseline values. CuSO4 pretreatment also reduced the striatal caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities that were increased three days after MPP(+)-induced damage. The present study provided evidence that copper pretreatment reduced MPP(+)-induced apoptotic damage, probably through direct action on copper-dependent proteins or indirectly on proteins in the apoptotic pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ef","authors":["Mois\u00e9s Rubio-Osornio","Marisol Orozco-Ibarra","Araceli D\u00edaz-Ruiz","Eduardo Brambila","Marie-Catherine Boll","Antonio Monroy-Noyola","Jorge Guevara","Sergio Montes","Camilo R\u00edos"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbi.2017.04.016","first_seen_on":"2017-05-05T23:17:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00092797"],"journal":"Chemico-Biological Interactions","last_mentioned_on":1502140703,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28442376","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0009279717301527#"],"pmid":"28442376","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Copper sulfate pretreatment prevents mitochondrial electron transport chain damage and apoptosis against MPP + -induced neurotoxicity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/copper-sulfate-pretreatment-prevents-mitochondrial-electron-transport-chain-damage-apoptosis-against"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":10,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336828,"mean":7.0294241902741,"rank":852104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7449609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336828,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246286,"mean":12.593945818868,"rank":39240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":206209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246286,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":955,"mean":2.9498490566038,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":955,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.2807692307692,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Copper sulfate pretreatment prevents mitochondrial electron transport chain damage and apoptosis against MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30471198053&p=1pl&v=1&x=F-KLFRaeVJ3yvdag2azYaA","license":"public","citation_ids":[19883890],"posted_on":"2017-05-05T23:14:34+00:00","summary":"Rubio-Osornio M, Orozco-Ibarra M, D\u00edaz-Ruiz A, Brambila E, Boll MC, Monroy-Noyola A, Guevara J, Montes S, R\u00edos C.","author":{"name":"Alzforum","url":"http:\/\/www.alzforum.org","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/355\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-04-08_at_12.16.09_1.png?1428491784"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/marchywka\/statuses\/894669072025100288","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19883890],"posted_on":"2017-08-07T21:18:23+00:00","author":{"name":"mike marchywka","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1569366319\/bullseye_normal.JPG","id_on_source":"marchywka","tweeter_id":"93076479","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6},"tweet_id":"894669072025100288"}]}}
