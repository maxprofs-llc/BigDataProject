Clinical prosthodontics, during the past decade, has significantly improved and developed according to the advancements in the science and patient's demands and needs. Conventional options in prosthodontics for substituting a missing single tooth include the removable partial denture, partial and full coverage bridgework, and resin-bonded bridgework. Dental implants have gained increasing popularity over the years as they are capable of restoring the function to near normal in both partial and completely edentulous arches. With substantial evidence available, fixed implant-supported prosthesis are fully acknowledged as a reliable treatment option for the replacement of single or multiple missing teeth nowadays. While dental implants are increasingly becoming the choice of replacement for missing teeth, the impediments associated with them are progressively emerging too.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc04","authors":["Ayesha Hanif","Saima Qureshi","Zeeshan Sheikh","Haroon Rashid"],"doi":"10.4103\/ejd.ejd_340_16","first_seen_on":"2017-05-05T23:21:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1305-7456"],"issue":"1","journal":"European Journal of Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1494026411,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28435381?platform=hootsuite"],"pmcid":"PMC5379828","pmid":"28435381","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Complications in implant dentistry","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complications-implant-dentistry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161014,"mean":6.911576885363,"rank":6197816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1097966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161014,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236494,"mean":12.551071684997,"rank":167291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236494,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":4.0297477477477,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
