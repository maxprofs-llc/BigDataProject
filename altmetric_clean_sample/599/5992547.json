Back translation was performed by a bilingual native English speaker and it was then reviewed to ensure its agreement with the original one. After 24 hours of admission, subjects were enrolled and clinical data collected. Definite diagnosis of delirium was made by a psychiatrist using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text-Revision criteria and the 6-item Thai Delirium Rating Scale; the 4AT was then administered to participants by nurses within 30 minutes. A 4AT score \u22654 was considered positive for delirium screening. The optimal cut-off point of the 4AT-T was identified by Youden's index.\nIn all, 24 out of 97 participants met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text-Revision criteria for delirium. At a cut-off score of 4 or greater, the 4AT-T exhibited satisfactory diagnostic performance with a sensitivity of 83.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.6%-95.3%) and specificity of 86.3% (95% CI: 76.3%-93.2%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.92. The specified score provided maximal Youden's index, suggesting an optimal criterion value for delirium screening.\nThe 4AT-T is a valid delirium-screening instrument for hospitalized elderly patients with acute medical illnesses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082a9","authors":["Sanchai Kuladee","Thanavadee Prachason"],"doi":"10.2147\/ndt.s97228","first_seen_on":"2016-02-24T23:11:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1176-6328"],"journal":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1459420400,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/development-and-validation-of-the-thai-version-of-the-4-lsquoarsquos-t-peer-reviewed-article-NDT"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=29133","pmid":"26966365","pubdate":"2016-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Development and validation of the Thai version of the 4 &lsquo;A&rsquo;s Test for delirium screening in hospitalized elderly patients with acute medical illnesses","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-validation-thai-version-4-test-delirium-screening-hospitalized-elderly-patients-acute-me"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7471181,"mean":6.4836306053357,"rank":1799305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4678107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7471181,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284386,"mean":10.483944757986,"rank":88642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":189972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284386,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1437,"mean":4.8719401114206,"rank":396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1437,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":5.6614594594595,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
