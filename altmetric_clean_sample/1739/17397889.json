Despite the knowledge that CVD is one of the leading causes of non-AIDS related premature mortality in people living with HIV (PLWH), relatively little attention has been attributed to sedentary behaviour in this population. The aims of this meta-analysis were to: (a) establish the pooled mean time spent sedentary, (b) investigate predictors of sedentary levels, and (c) explore differences with age- and gender matched healthy controls.\nTwo independent authors searched major databases until August, 2016. A random effects meta-analysis was performed.\nAcross 6 unique cross-sectional studies, including 9 sedentary levels, there were 523 (292\u2642) PLWH (age range=37-58 years). PLWH spent 533 min\/day (95% CI=466-599) engaging in sedentary behaviour. There was a trend (P=0.07) for higher levels of sedentary behaviour in self-report measures (551min, 95%CI=543-560, N=4) than in objective sedentary behaviour time (505min, 95%CI=498-512, N=3). The time PLWH spend engaging in sedentary behaviour is among the highest levels reported in the literature.\nGiven that sedentary behaviour is an independent predictor of CVD, future lifestyle interventions specifically targeting the prevention of sedentary behaviour in PLWH are warranted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de9","authors":["Davy Vancampfort","James Mugisha","Marc De Hert","Michel Probst","Brendon Stubbs"],"doi":"10.1123\/jpah.2016-0507","first_seen_on":"2017-03-16T08:20:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1543-3080","1543-5474"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Activity and Health","last_mentioned_on":1489735142,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28290767\/?i=5&from=sedentary%20behaviour"],"pmid":"28290767","pubdate":"2017-03-16T22:18:59+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Sedentary Behaviour in People Living With HIV: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.humankinetics.com\/doi\/10.1123\/jpah.2016-0507","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sedentary-behaviour-people-living-hiv-systematic-review-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.45,"score_history":{"1y":4.45,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":1773701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6591478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243748,"mean":13.610663171239,"rank":71880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":171418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243748,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":534,"mean":6.7119774859287,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":534,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.0555555555556,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":5,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BrendonStubbs\/statuses\/842289293401952256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17397889],"posted_on":"2017-03-16T08:19:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Brendon Stubbs","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Brendon_Stubbs\/?ev=hdr_xprf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/837073775527096320\/IQECiF-t_normal.jpg","description":"Physiotherapist, clinician and researcher.
