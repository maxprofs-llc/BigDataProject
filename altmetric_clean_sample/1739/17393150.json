Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses and degradation reactions. Biseokeaniamide B (2) exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against human HeLa cancer cells, and compounds 1-3 inhibited both SOAT1 and SOAT2, not only at an enzyme level but also at a cellular level. Biseokeaniamides (1-3) are the first linear lipopeptides that have been shown to exhibit SOAT-inhibitory activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8b","authors":["Arihiro Iwasaki","Takato Tadenuma","Shimpei Sumimoto","Taichi Ohshiro","Kaori Ozaki","Keisuke Kobayashi","Toshiaki Teruya","Hiroshi Tomoda","Kiyotake Suenaga"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jnatprod.7b00137","first_seen_on":"2017-03-16T00:04:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0163-3864","1520-6025"],"journal":"Journal of Natural Products","last_mentioned_on":1501150691,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jnatprod.7b00137","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28294609?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28294609","pubdate":"2017-03-16T22:08:17+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Biseokeaniamides A, B, and C, Sterol O-Acyltransferase Inhibitors from an Okeania sp.
