At 99th percentile (0.02 \u00b5g\/L) the CV was found to be 18%, below the clinically acceptable cutoff of 20%. In the overall population, ROC AUC was not significantly different between the central laboratory assay and POC assay, with 0.952 (95% CI, 0.918 - 0.952) for hs-cTnT concentrations at presentation and 0.953 (95% CI, 0.912 - 0.953) for cTnI. Sensitivity and specificity of hs-cTnT vs. cTnI for AMI (n = 32) were 97% and 78% vs. 91% and 86%, respectively. Our results indicated 90.4% concordance between the two methods using the 99th percentile specific for each assay. The Kappa coefficient was higher than 0.75, and the strength of agreement could be considered to be good.\nThe results of cTnI Alere assays provide similar clinical classification of patients, particularly for the AMI group as compared to the central laboratory hs-cTnT assay and could be suitable for clinical in accordance with the recommendations of Global Task Force guidelines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f06","authors":["Dupuy, Anne M","Baillet, Solenne","Dumont, Richard","Giraud, Isabelle","Badiou, Stephanie","Bargnoux, Anne S","Kuster, Nils","Roubille, Francois","Cristol, Jean Paul"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-12T10:37:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1433-6510"],"issue":"4","journal":"Clinical Laboratory","last_mentioned_on":1491993455,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28397478?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28397478","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Point of Care Cardiac Troponin Assay Analytical Performances for their Use in Clinical Routine.","type":"article","volume":"63"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063599,"mean":6.8425680134317,"rank":6982211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063599,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237173,"mean":12.880357225979,"rank":193594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237173,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252,"mean":1.4400796812749,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.44230769230769,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/troponinpapers\/statuses\/852108428390547457","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18743074],"posted_on":"2017-04-12T10:37:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Troponin_papers","url":"http:\/\/www.highsteacs.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/658230994202468352\/J1L9QKml_normal.png","description":"Twitter-bot from @highSTEACS searches PubMed for latest #troponin #research","id_on_source":"troponinpapers","tweeter_id":"4038106461","geo":{"lt":55.95206,"ln":-3.19648,"country":"GB"},"followers":253},"tweet_id":"852108428390547457"}]}}
