A mutant screen in a constitutively active plant immune receptor mutant snc1 (suppressor of npr1, constitutive1) identified a suppressor mutation of SNC1-induced defense responses in an ABC transporter coding gene ABCG14. ABCG14 transports CK from roots to the shoots, and the suppression of the SNC1-mediated defense response by the loss of ABCG14 is due to a deficiency of trans-zeatin (tZ)-type CK in the shoot. In addition, exogenous application of the tZ-type CK enhances disease resistance associated with increased expression of the plant immune receptor gene SNC1. Taken together, this study further established the role of tZ-type CK in disease resistance and suggests a new intersection of CKs with plant immunity at the expression regulation of a plant immune receptor gene.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e8","authors":["Wang, Shuai","Wang, Shu","Sun, Qi","Yang, Leiyun","Zhu, Ying","Yuan, Yaping","Hua, Jian","Shuai Wang","Shu Wang","Qi Sun","Leiyun Yang","Ying Zhu","Yaping Yuan","Jian Hua"],"doi":"10.1094\/mpmi-01-17-0011-r","first_seen_on":"2017-04-12T10:10:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0894-0282"],"journal":"Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions","last_mentioned_on":1493409584,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28398838?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/apsjournals.apsnet.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1094\/MPMI-01-17-0011-R"],"pmid":"28398838","pubdate":"2017-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Scientific Societies","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","botany","microbiology"],"title":"A Role of Cytokinin Transporter in Arabidopsis Immunity","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8138092,"mean":6.879675480889,"rank":4083011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3848255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8138092,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240484,"mean":12.93766568115,"rank":123614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":106611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240484,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":702,"mean":2.7731783166904,"rank":339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":702,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":4.2791666666667,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/statuses\/852099911973715968","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18742367],"posted_on":"2017-04-12T10:03:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
