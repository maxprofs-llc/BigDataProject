The aim of the current analysis was to understand beliefs about the Rhode Island Chronic Pain Program from the perspective of the patient receiving services, the provider delivering services, and the administrator implementing the program.\nA qualitative interview-based study.\nPatients (N\u2009=\u200924), providers (N\u2009=\u200913), and administrators (N\u2009=\u200911) who were already involved, or were eligible to be involved, in the Chronic Pain Program.\nSemistructured interviews were conducted to elicit information about experiences with the program. Transcriptions of audio recordings were analyzed according to principles of deductive thematic analysis.\nPatient interviews revealed five themes: 1) relationship between stress and pain, 2) trusting patient-provider relationships, 3) increased quality of life, 4) temporary pain relief, and 5) anxiety and discomfort associated with acupuncture. Provider interviews revealed three themes: 1) a way to reach the disenfranchised, 2) not enough visits with patients, and 3) opportunity to build relationships with patients. Administrator interviews revealed two themes: 1) a means to offer a range of support services to complicated patients and 2) unanswered questions over whether the program adequately serves patients with the greatest needs.\n\u2002Key stakeholders in this new initiative agree that the Rhode Island Chronic Pain Program shows promise and that the holistic approach may be a good match for this hard-to-reach population.\nKey Words.\u2002Chronic Pain; Complementary Medicine; Pain Management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003282","authors":["Donovan, Elizabeth","Ranney, Megan L","Patry, Emily J","McKenzie, Michelle","Baird, Janette","Green, Traci C","Ranney, Megan L.","Patry, Emily J.","Green, Traci C."],"doi":"10.1093\/pm\/pnx051","first_seen_on":"2017-04-12T10:11:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-2375","1526-4637"],"journal":"Pain Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1506967510,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28398544?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28398544?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/painmedicine\/article\/18\/9\/1805\/3231590\/Beliefs-About-a-Complementary-and-Alternative?rss=1&utm_content=buffer4646b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/painmedicine\/article\/18\/9\/1805\/3231590\/Beliefs-About-a-Complementary-and-Alternative"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/painmedicine\/article-pdf\/18\/9\/1805\/19692747\/pnx051.pdf","pmid":"28398544","pubdate":"2017-04-12T22:01:52+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"OUP accepted manuscript","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/beliefs-about-complementary-alternative-therapybased-chronic-pain-management-program-medicaid-popula"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":1.5,"1m":1.5,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":1,"3d":1,"2d":1,"1d":1,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8460645,"mean":7.1079906952629,"rank":3681053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4657900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8460645,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252819,"mean":13.032102081339,"rank":106074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":142544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252819,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1466,"mean":8.1210443686007,"rank":705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1466,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":20.354761904762,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/painmanwise\/statuses\/852101016573157380","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18742446],"posted_on":"2017-04-12T10:08:08+00:00","author":{"name":"painmanwise","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514094062056390656\/ORtXawZi_normal.png","id_on_source":"painmanwise","tweeter_id":"2826634074","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":131},"tweet_id":"852101016573157380"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lolitsjournals\/statuses\/852106549967306752","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18742446],"posted_on":"2017-04-12T10:30:07+00:00","author":{"name":"lolitsjournals","url":"http:\/\/keeganmclean.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/652288661413695488\/TMbtKL-d_normal.jpg","description":"Current journals on all things Chiropractic.
