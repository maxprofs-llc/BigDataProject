These include symptoms of psychosis, depression, anxiety and also cognitive deficits. Accordingly, psychological treatments aim to reduce MA use and related problems, including symptoms of mental ill health. Although there has been a substantial body of research reporting on the evidence of effectiveness of psychological treatments for MA use, there is a paucity of research addressing the effectiveness of these treatments for coexisting symptoms of mental ill health. We aim to address this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the evidence for psychological treatments for MA use and associated symptoms of mental ill health in experimental\/controlled clinical studies. In addition, a critical evaluation of study methods and the outcomes of psychological interventions on MA use and symptoms of mental ill health will be conducted.\nThe Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement will be used to inform the methods of this review. Eight electronic peer-reviewed databases will be searched. Pilot searches have been conducted for MA literature considering controlled clinical trials only. Eligible articles will be independently assessed against inclusion criteria. Before final analyses are completed, searches will be rerun and if eligible, additional studies will be retrieved for inclusion. A quantitative synthesis of the findings will be reported where possible, and 'summary of findings' tables will be generated for each comparison. Risk ratios and 95%\u2009CI (dichotomous outcomes) will be calculated and\/or effect size according to Cohen's formula (continuous outcomes) for the primary outcome of each trial.\nNo ethical issues are foreseen. Findings will be disseminated widely to clinicians and researchers via journal publication and conference presentation(s).\nCRD42016043657.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Alexandra Stuart","Amanda L Baker","Jenny Bowman","Kristen McCarter","Alexandra Mary Janice Denham","Nicole Lee","Kim Colyvas","Adrian Dunlop"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-015383","first_seen_on":"2017-09-08T07:53:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"9","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1504857220,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/9\/e015383?rss=1","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-015383"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/7\/9\/e015383.full.pdf","pmid":"28882907","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e015383","title":"Protocol for a systematic review of psychological treatment for methamphetamine use: an analysis of methamphetamine use and mental health symptom outcomes","type":"article","volume":"7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":7249282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123540,"mean":11.934739604498,"rank":100577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123540,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6225,"mean":17.104838367609,"rank":5737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6225,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270,"mean":10.023866171004,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/906062970731589632","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24937641],"posted_on":"2017-09-08T07:53:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":981},"tweet_id":"906062970731589632"}]}}
