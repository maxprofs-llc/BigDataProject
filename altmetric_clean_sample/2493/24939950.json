Focusing on processing raw focused-ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) tomography data, we reconstructed three mixed-matrix membrane samples made of 6FDA-ODA polyimide and silicalite-1 particles. In the first step of image processing, backscattered electron (BSE) and secondary electron (SE) signals were mixed in a ratio that was expected to obtain a segmented 3D image with a realistic volume fraction of silicalite-1. Second, after spatial alignment of the stacked FIB-SEM data, the 3D image was smoothed using adaptive median and anisotropic nonlinear diffusion filters. Third, the image was segmented using the power watershed method coupled with a seeding algorithm based on geodesic reconstruction from the markers. If the resulting volume fraction did not match the target value quantified by chemical analysis of the sample, the BSE and SE signals were mixed in another ratio and the procedure was repeated until the target volume fraction was achieved. Otherwise, the segmented 3D image (replica) was accepted and its microstructure was thoroughly characterized with special attention paid to connectivity of the silicalite phase. In terms of the phase connectivity, Monte Carlo simulations based on the pure-phase permeability values enabled us to calculate the effective permeability tensor, the main diagonal elements of which were compared with the experimental permeability. In line with the hypothesis proposed in our recent paper (\u010capek, P. et\u00a0al. (2014) Comput. Mater. Sci. 89, 142-156), the results confirmed that the existence of particle clusters was a key microstructural feature determining effective permeability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e58","authors":["DIBL\u00cdKOV\u00c1, P.","VESEL\u00dd, M.","SYSEL, P.","\u010cAPEK, P."],"doi":"10.1111\/jmi.12618","first_seen_on":"2017-09-08T09:13:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00222720","1365-2818"],"journal":"Journal of Microscopy","last_mentioned_on":1504861321,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jmi.12618\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jmi.12618\/pdf","pmid":"28876453","pubdate":"2017-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Reconstructing the microstructure of polyimide-silicalite mixed-matrix membranes and their particle connectivity using FIB-SEM tomography","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":6064264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2021808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123540,"mean":11.934778458625,"rank":79358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":36900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123540,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":655,"mean":2.4735443425076,"rank":364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":655,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.4642857142857,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JofMicroscopy\/statuses\/906080166933258241","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24939950],"posted_on":"2017-09-08T09:02:00+00:00","author":{"name":"JournalofMicroscopy","url":"http:\/\/www.journalofmicroscopy.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2286407032\/b2do0ey5k8xsq1ep5xok_normal.jpeg","description":"For scientists & technologists using any form of microscopy, the Journal publishes quality review articles and original research papers.","id_on_source":"JofMicroscopy","tweeter_id":"74695419","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":1264},"tweet_id":"906080166933258241"}],"facebook":[{"title":"JournalofMicroscopy on Twitter","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1473590592720708&id=123927841020330","license":"public","citation_ids":[24939950],"posted_on":"2017-09-08T09:02:01+00:00","summary":"View this paper by P. \u010capek et al using FIB-SEM tomography> https:\/\/t.co\/tDquyjE3Iu #FIB-SEM https:\/\/t.co\/ocUZCj1suP","author":{"name":"Journal of Microscopy","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/123927841020330","facebook_wall_name":"Journal of Microscopy","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/123927841020330\/picture","id_on_source":"123927841020330"}}]}}
