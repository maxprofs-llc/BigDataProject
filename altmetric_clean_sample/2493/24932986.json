The results show that the thermoelectric performance of molecular device can be significantly improved by different contact geometries. The ZT value of the device can reach 1.2 at room temperature, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of graphene. Moreover, the change of the coupling between molecule and electrodes can also enhance the ZT value. The ZT value can be further optimized to 1.4 at 300\u2009K and 5.9 at 100\u2009K owing to the decrease of electronic thermal conductance and almost unchanged power factor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Xuan-Hao Cao","Wu-Xing Zhou","Chang-Yong Chen","Li-Ming Tang","Mengqiu Long","Ke-Qiu Chen"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-11224-x","first_seen_on":"2017-09-08T05:12:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1505150893,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-11224-x?WT.feed_name=subjects_materials-science"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-11224-x.pdf","pmid":"28883653","pubdate":"2017-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"10842","subjects":["science"],"title":"Excellent thermoelectric properties induced by different contact geometries in phenalenyl-based single-molecule devices","type":"article","volume":"7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":1.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8397236,"mean":7.0723276090205,"rank":3867546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4445673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8397236,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128894,"mean":11.973502827927,"rank":54226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":72522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128894,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37323,"mean":14.716720915278,"rank":17231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":19388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37323,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2758,"mean":11.756305404425,"rank":1222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2758,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1,"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlackPhysicists\/statuses\/906022442069405697","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24932986],"posted_on":"2017-09-08T05:12:37+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16429},"tweet_id":"906022442069405697"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Shankarcurious\/statuses\/906024120810332160","license":"gnip","rt":["BlackPhysicists"],"citation_ids":[24932986],"posted_on":"2017-09-08T05:19:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Shankar lal Dhakar","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/902827457337634816\/747NV1DN_normal.jpg","description":"((((((((((Martian)))))))))","id_on_source":"Shankarcurious","tweeter_id":"902825870049517568","geo":{"lt":26,"ln":74,"country":"IN"},"followers":20},"tweet_id":"906024120810332160"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AIT_ItTS\/statuses\/907291203263188992","license":"gnip","rt":["BlackPhysicists"],"citation_ids":[24932986],"posted_on":"2017-09-11T17:14:14+00:00","author":{"name":"AIT","url":"http:\/\/ait.icmate.cnr.it\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447685973904605185\/u8Zb5Oal_normal.jpeg","description":"Account of the Italian Thermoelectric Society (Associazione Italiana di Termoelettricit\u00e0).
