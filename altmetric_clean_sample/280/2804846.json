Alliance concepts have, however, been criticized for lack of conceptual clarity. The paper presents a generic model as a heuristic means for clarifying the conceptual meaning of the therapeutic alliance. The model distinguishes between the personal relationship aspect, and the collaborative, task-related aspect of the alliance, with therapist, patient, and common contributions to each of these aspects. The model is compared to other alliance conceptualizations, and its implications for alliance theory and research are discussed. A content analysis of four widely used alliance scales in relation to the model shows the scales to represent conceptually different, yet overlapping constructs. It is argued that the componential nature of the therapeutic alliance will render difficult any interpretation of findings regarding the relationship between alliance and outcome in traditional process-outcome research. More complex research strategies guided by theory are called for, if the therapeutic alliance should remain a vital field of research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034c7","authors":["E Hougaard"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-23T03:45:57+00:00","issns":["0036-5564"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1414035918,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8191262"],"pmid":"8191262","pubdate":"1994-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The therapeutic alliance--a conceptual analysis.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/therapeutic-alliancea-conceptual-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4409947,"mean":4.8306983503683,"rank":3425545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":130068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4409947,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121837,"mean":7.510284497193,"rank":91842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121837,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218,"mean":4.5152073732719,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.11,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
