The aim of this study was to examine association between cagA, vacA-s1 and vacA-s2 genotypes of H. pylori and severity of chronic gastritis and presence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and to correlate these with IL-8 levels in the gastric mucosa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000827","authors":["Iqbal Siddique","Asmaa Al-Qabandi","Jaber Al-Ali","Waleed Alazmi","Anjum Memon","Abu Salim Mustafa","Thamradeen A Junaid"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13099-014-0041-1","first_seen_on":"2014-10-23T06:20:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-4749"],"issue":"1","journal":"Gut Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1414045228,"links":["http:\/\/www.gutpathogens.com\/content\/6\/1\/41","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s13099-014-0041-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.gutpathogens.com\/content\/pdf\/s13099-014-0041-1.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4181383","pmid":"25279005","pubdate":"2014-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"41","title":"Association between Helicobacter pylori genotypes and severity of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and gastric mucosal interleukin-8 levels: Evidence from a study in the Middle East","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-helicobacter-pylori-genotypes-severity-chronic-gastritis-peptic-ulcer-disease-ga"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":3652114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":143065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124471,"mean":8.4595938780431,"rank":98166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124471,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":6.3779482758621,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":4,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":5},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Immunology and Microbiology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":9,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Association between Helicobacter pylori genotypes and severity of chronic gastritis, peptic...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1558000331099745\/posts\/1558008617765583","license":"public","citation_ids":[2805022],"posted_on":"2014-10-23T06:20:28+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/www.gutpathogens.com\/content\/6\/1\/41 www.gutpathogens.com","author":{"name":"Gut Pathogens","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1558000331099745","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1558000331099745\/picture","id_on_source":"1558000331099745"}}]}}
