A novel hybrid approach to small-angle scattering data analysis was developed. In combination, these provided direct structural insight into membrane-protein localization in the nanodisc and into the protein-lipid interactions. It was found that bR is laterally decentred in the plane of the disc and is slightly tilted in the phospholipid bilayer. The thickness of the bilayer is reduced in response to the incorporation of bR. The observed tilt of bR is in good accordance with previously performed theoretical predictions and computer simulations based on the bR crystal structure. The result is a significant and essential step on the way to developing a general small-angle scattering-based method for determining the low-resolution structures of membrane proteins in physiologically relevant environments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000214a","authors":["Kynde SA","Skar-Gislinge N","Pedersen MC","Midtgaard SR","Simonsen JB","Schweins R","Mortensen K","Arleth L"],"doi":"10.1107\/s1399004713028344","first_seen_on":"2014-10-22T10:35:51+00:00","issns":["1399-0047"],"issue":"Pt 2","journal":"Acta Crystallographica: Section D (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1448530053,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24531471?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24531471","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1107\/S1399004713028344"],"pmid":"24531471","pubdate":"2014-02-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Small-angle scattering gives direct structural information about a membrane protein inside a lipid environment","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/smallangle-scattering-gives-direct-structural-information-about-membrane-protein-inside-lipid-enviro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6611727,"mean":6.131580845607,"rank":2738318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3722933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6611727,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170841,"mean":8.2189296885977,"rank":72184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":93027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170841,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1034,"mean":2.472371732817,"rank":406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1034,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":2.2251081081081,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
