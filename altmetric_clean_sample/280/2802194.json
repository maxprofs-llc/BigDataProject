In this study, six soil samples with distinct land-use regimes (forestland soil, paddy soil, wheat-planted soil, fruit-planted soil, grassland soil, and rape-planted soil) were collected from Chuzhou city in the Anhui province to elucidate the effects of land use on the abundance and diversity of AOA and AOB. The abundance of the archaeal amoA gene ranged from 2.12\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(4) copies per gram of dry soil to 2.57\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(5) copies per gram of dry soil, while the abundance of the bacterial amoA gene ranged from 5.58\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(4) copies per gram of dry soil to 1.59\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(8) copies per gram of dry soil. The grassland and the rape-planted soil samples maintained the highest abundance of the bacterial and archaeal amoA genes, respectively. The abundance of the archaeal amoA gene was positively correlated with the pH (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The ammonia concentrations exhibited a significantly positive relation with the abundance of the bacterial amoA gene (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and the number of OTUs of AOB (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The community composition of AOB was more sensitive to the land-use regimes than that of AOA. The data obtained in this study may be useful to better understand the nitrification process in soils with different land-use regimes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000269a","authors":["Dayong Zhao","Juan Luo","Jianqun Wang","Rui Huang","Kun Guo","Yi Li","Qinglong L Wu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00284-014-0714-5","first_seen_on":"2014-10-22T11:30:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0991"],"journal":"Current Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1442345346,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25331793?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25331793?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25331793","pubdate":"2014-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"The Influence of Land Use on the Abundance and Diversity of Ammonia Oxidizers.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-land-abundance-diversity-ammonia-oxidizers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6588517,"mean":6.113364640232,"rank":4632502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1714305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6588517,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170684,"mean":8.2167812142981,"rank":106947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":55858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170684,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":535,"mean":2.6641610486891,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":535,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.2323076923077,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
