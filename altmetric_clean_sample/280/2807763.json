Awesome paper on adaptive resistance and autophagy."],"citation":{"abstract":"Bim perturbations contribute to resistance to various standard and novel agents. Here we demonstrate that Bim plays an important functional role in bortezomib (btz) resistance in multiple myeloma (MM) cells, and that targeting Bim by combining histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs e.g., SBHA) with BH3-mimetics (e.g., ABT-737) overcomes btz-resistance. BH3-only protein profiling revealed high Bim levels (Bim(hi)) in most MM cell lines and primary CD138(+) MM samples. Whereas shRNA Bim knockdown conferred btz-resistance in Bim(hi) cells, adaptive btz-resistant cells displayed marked Bim down-regulation. SBHA up-regulated Bim, and when combined with ABT-737, which released Bim from Bcl-2\/Bcl-xL, potently killed cultured and primary btz-resistant MM cells. These events were associated with Bim-associated autophagy attenuation, whereas Bim knockdown sharply increased autophagy in Bim(hi) cells. Interestingly, in Bim(low) cells, autophagy disruption by chloroquine (CQ) was required for SBHA\/ABT-737 to induce Bim expression and lethality. CQ also further enhanced SBHA\/ABT-737 lethality in btz-resistant cells. Finally, SBHA failed to diminish autophagy or potentiate ABT-737-induced apoptosis in bim(-\/-) MEFs. Thus, Bim deficiency represents a novel mechanism of adaptive btz-resistance in MM cells, and Bim-targeting strategies combining HDACIs (which up-regulate Bim) and BH3-mimetics (which unleash Bim from anti-apoptotic proteins) overcomes such resistance, in part by disabling cytoprotective autophagy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Chen S","Zhang Y","Zhou L","Leng Y","Lin H","Kmieciak M","Pei XY","Jones R","Orlowski RZ","Dai Y","Grant S","S.
