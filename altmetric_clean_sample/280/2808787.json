The working space required for traditional stapling devices limits their use in pediatric video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lung lobectomy. The use of Hem-o-lok clips (Teleflex Medical Inc. Research Triangle Park, NC) has been described for a number of applications in minimally invasive surgery and may provide an alternative to traditional stapling devices for bronchial closure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f48","doi":"10.1016\/j.jss.2014.07.053","first_seen_on":"2014-10-24T04:43:24+00:00","issns":["0022-4804"],"journal":"Journal of Surgical Research","last_mentioned_on":1414125684,"links":["http:\/\/www.journalofsurgicalresearch.com\/article\/S0022-4804(14)00717-3\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journalofsurgicalresearch.com\/article\/S0022480414007173\/pdf","pmid":"25167784","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Hilar closure using staplers or Hem-o-lok clips in a rabbit model","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hilar-closure-using-staplers-hemolok-clips-rabbit-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4412571,"mean":4.825676177232,"rank":3425488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":130294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4412571,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121980,"mean":7.5406086457505,"rank":91793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121980,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1220,"mean":1.6175077932732,"rank":881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1220,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.169696969697,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Hilar closure using staplers or Hem-o-lok clips in a rabbit model - Journal of Surgical Research","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1445473252397123\/posts\/1482686065342508","license":"public","citation_ids":[2808787],"posted_on":"2014-10-24T04:41:24+00:00","summary":"A new article from the Journal of Surgical Reasearch is available: Hilar closure using staplers or Hem-o-lok clips in a rabbit model,Hilar closure using staplers or Hem-o-lok clips in a rabbit model www.journalofsurgicalresearch.com","author":{"name":"Society of University Surgeons","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1445473252397123","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1445473252397123\/picture","id_on_source":"1445473252397123"}}]}}
