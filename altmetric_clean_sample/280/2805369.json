This characteristic gave rise to the possibility that PiB could be used to trace WM pathology. In a group of cognitively healthy elderly we examined PiB retention in normal-appearing WM (NAWM) and WM lesions (WML), one of the most common brain pathologies in aging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002843","authors":["Lidia Glodzik","Henry Rusinek","Jinyu Li","Cyrus Zhou","Wai Tsui","Lisa Mosconi","Yi Li","Ricardo Osorio","Schantel Williams","Catherine Randall","Nicole Spector","Pauline McHugh","John Murray","Elizabeth Pirraglia","Shankar Vallabhajolusa","Mony de Leon"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00259-014-2897-1","first_seen_on":"2014-10-23T09:02:54+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1619-7089"],"journal":"European Journal of Nuclear Medicine & Molecular Imaging","last_mentioned_on":1414054949,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25331458?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25331458","pubdate":"2014-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Reduced retention of Pittsburgh compound B in white matter lesions.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduced-retention-pittsburgh-compound-b-white-matter-lesions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2296165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1617234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124436,"mean":8.1987744284166,"rank":61680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":47920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124436,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":568,"mean":1.3010229276896,"rank":166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":568,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.5433939393939,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ECTPubMed\/status\/525210640663588865","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2805369],"posted_on":"2014-10-23T09:02:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Electro Therapy","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_4_normal.png","id_on_source":"ECTPubMed","tweeter_id":"1224674672","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":9},"tweet_id":"525210640663588865"}]}}
