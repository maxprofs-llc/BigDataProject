In this work we report an approach that enables the application of multireference ab initio methods for the calculation of local zero field splitting tensors, one of the leading terms in the spin Hamiltonian for exchange-coupled systems of high nuclearity. The method referred to as local complete active space configuration interaction (L-CASCI) represents a multireference calculation with an active space composed of local orbitals of the center of interest. By successive permutation of the active space to include the localized orbitals corresponding to a particular center of the complex, all on-site parameters can be easily obtained at a high-level of theory with a corresponding low computational cost. Benchmark calculations on synthetic complexes confirm the validity of the approach. As an example of the applicability of the L-CASCI method to large systems, we determine the local anisotropy of the Mn(III) ion of the tetranuclear manganese cluster of photosystem II in both structural forms of its S2 state.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Marius Retegan"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic502081c","first_seen_on":"2014-10-23T19:47:16+00:00","issns":["0020-1669"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1414446357,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic502081c","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic502081c?ref=tw&utm_content=buffer1808e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer&"],"pmid":"25340874","pubdate":"2014-10-22T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A First-Principles Approach to the Calculation of the on-Site Zero-Field Splitting in Polynuclear Transition Metal Complexes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/firstprinciples-approach-calculation-onsite-zerofield-splitting-polynuclear-transition-metal-complex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230816,"mean":5.9681137989188,"rank":2256934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3962666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230816,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154527,"mean":8.4316953522386,"rank":54549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":99628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154527,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7886,"mean":1.0504870006341,"rank":987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7886,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":372,"mean":1.3126900269542,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":372,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
