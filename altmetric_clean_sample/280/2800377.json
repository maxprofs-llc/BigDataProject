The common denominator for all of these studies is the goal of elucidating the underlying neural mechanisms of tinnitus with the ultimate purpose of finding a cure. While these basic science findings may not be immediately applicable to the clinician who works directly with patients to assist them in managing their reactions to tinnitus, a clear understanding of these findings is needed to develop the most effective procedures for alleviating tinnitus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f52","authors":["Henry JA","Roberts LE","Caspary DM","Theodoroff SM","Salvi RJ"],"doi":"10.3766\/jaaa.25.1.2","first_seen_on":"2014-10-22T02:23:46+00:00","issns":["1050-0545"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Audiology","last_mentioned_on":1413955203,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24622858?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24622858","pubdate":"2014-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["audiology"],"title":"Underlying mechanisms of tinnitus: review and clinical implications.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/underlying-mechanisms-tinnitus-review-clinical-implications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1782670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2645831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124572,"mean":8.2181264339214,"rank":43541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":78576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124572,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":1.907299270073,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.8727272727273,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
