The reaction of formamidinium salt containing non-coordinating anions, such as (BF4)(-) (2) and (PF6)(-) (3) with palladium acetate in acetonitrile or propanenitrile leads to the formation of cationic bis(1,3,5-triazapentadiene)palladium complexes 6, 7 or 8, 9 respectively. However, the reaction with acrylonitrile afforded an unprecedented cyclic and anionic six-membered palladacycle complex (10). In addition a reaction of 1 with Pd(OAc)2 in THF afforded an acyclic palladium complex (11), which is a possible intermediate formed before conversion to the cyclic six-membered palladium complexes (4, 5 and 10) in presence of organonitriles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Ganapathi Anantharaman","Vivek Gupta","Vedhagiri Karthik"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4dt02721c","endpage":"766","first_seen_on":"2014-10-23T16:18:46+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"2","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1415882015,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2014\/DT\/C4DT02721C","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2014\/DT\/C4DT02721C#%21divAbstract","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C4DT02721C"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2014\/dt\/c4dt02721c","pmid":"25407228","pubdate":"2014-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"758","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Cyclic six-membered palladium complexes derived from palladium mediated C\u2013N coupling of organonitrile and formamidine","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cyclic-sixmembered-palladium-complexes-derived-palladium-mediated-cn-coupling-organonitrile-formamid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":2874371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1470056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124437,"mean":8.3134156996371,"rank":76000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":43196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124437,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992,"mean":0.69031810787136,"rank":1741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":5773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.1464285714286,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/status\/525318005459144704","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2806830],"posted_on":"2014-10-23T16:09:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"525318005459144704"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/status\/532873911851958273","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2806830],"posted_on":"2014-11-13T12:33:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"532873911851958273"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AlfaAesar\/status\/529329704600211456","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2806830],"posted_on":"2014-11-03T17:50:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Alfa Aesar","url":"http:\/\/www.alfa.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/649491051091259392\/4kyEv9B3_normal.jpg","description":"Alfa Aesar, now Thermo Fisher Scientific, a leading manufacturer and supplier of research chemicals, metals and materials in a wide span of applications.","id_on_source":"AlfaAesar","tweeter_id":"320476197","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1864},"tweet_id":"529329704600211456"}]}}
