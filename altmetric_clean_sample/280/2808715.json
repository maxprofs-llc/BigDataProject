In Brazil, schistosomiasis has been reported in 19 states, showing areas of high and medium endemicity and a wide range of areas of low endemicity (ALE). Barra Mansa in Rio de Janeiro state has an estimated prevalence of 1%. ALE represent a new challenge for the helminth control because about 75% of infected individuals are asymptomatic and infections occur with a low parasite load (<100 eggs per gram of feces), causing a decrease in sensitivity of stool parasitological techniques, which are a reference for the laboratory diagnosis of this helminth. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique in serum and feces DNA samples using the techniques of Kato-Katz (KK), Hoffman, Pons and Janer (HH) as references, during an epidemiological survey using fecal samples and sera from randomized residents from an ALE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Maria Cristina Carvalho Esp\u00edrito-Santo","M\u00f3nica Viviana Alvarado-Mora","Emmanuel Dias-Neto","L\u00edvia Souza Botelho-Lima","Jo\u00e3o Paulo Moreira","Maria Amorim","Pedro Luiz Silva Pinto","Ashley R Heath","Vera L\u00facia Pagliusi Castilho","Elenice Messias do Nascimento Gon\u00e7alves","Expedito Jos\u00e9 de Albuquerque Luna","Flair Jos\u00e9 Carrilho","Jo\u00e3o Renato Rebello Pinho","Ronaldo Cesar Borges Gryschek"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12879-014-0558-4","first_seen_on":"2014-10-24T04:05:37+00:00","issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1414123512,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2334\/14\/558\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12879-014-0558-4.pdf","pmid":"25338651","pubdate":"2014-10-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"558","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Evaluation of real-time PCR assay to detect Schistosoma mansoni infections in a low endemic setting","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12879-014-0558-4","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-realtime-pcr-assay-detect-schistosoma-mansoni-infections-low-endemic-setting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":3550241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":838664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143246,"mean":8.5410237425392,"rank":97334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":28441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143246,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2669,"mean":3.1957421289355,"rank":1970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2669,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178,"mean":3.7268361581921,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
