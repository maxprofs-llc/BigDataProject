In this study, two soybean genotypes, one susceptible (NA 4613) and one partially resistant (DM 4670) to SDS infection, were inoculated with F. tucumaniae. Disease symptoms were scored at 7, 10, 14, and 25 days post-inoculation (dpi). The greatest difference in the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) values among genotypes was observed at 25 dpi. In order to detect early metabolic markers that could potentially discriminate between susceptible and resistant genotypes, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of root samples were performed. These analyses show higher levels of several amino acids and the polyamine cadaverine in the inoculated than in the uninoculated susceptible cultivar at 7 dpi. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the metabolic profile of roots harvested at the earliest time points from the inoculated susceptible genotype was clearly differentiated from the rest of the samples. Furthermore, variables associated with the first principal component were mainly amino acids. Taken together, the results indicate that the pathogen induced the susceptible plant to accumulate amino acids in roots at early time points after infection, suggesting that GC-MS-based metabolomics could be used for the rapid characterization of cultivar response to SDS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fdd","authors":["Mar\u00eda M Scandiani","Alicia G Luque","Mar\u00eda V Razori","Lucila Ciancio Casalini","Takayuki Aoki","Kerry O'Donnell","Gerardo D L Cervigni","Claudia P Spampinato"],"doi":"10.1093\/jxb\/eru432","first_seen_on":"2014-10-23T10:09:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-2431"],"journal":"Journal of Experimental Botany","last_mentioned_on":1425005015,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25336687?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/10\/20\/jxb.eru432.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25336687"],"pmid":"25336687","pubdate":"2014-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Metabolic profiles of soybean roots during early stages of Fusarium tucumaniae infection.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-profiles-soybean-roots-during-early-stages-fusarium-tucumaniae-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4811984,"mean":5.7519713552635,"rank":2387559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2279452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4811984,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134542,"mean":8.6091155112569,"rank":63222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":65476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134542,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1954,"mean":2.3971356886841,"rank":935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1954,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":2.2104,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
