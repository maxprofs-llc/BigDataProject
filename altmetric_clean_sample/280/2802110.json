Experimental Design: NRP-1 and VEGFR-2 expression were examined by tissue microarray and peritumoral hypoxia by pimonidazole staining and angiogenesis by microvessel density (MVD). OS and TTR were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. Results: Peritumoral NRP-1 and VEGFR-2 expression were significantly higher than that of the tumoral tissue (p < 0.001 for both), and high peritumoral expression of both factors was negatively associated with tumor size (p < 0.001 for both). Patients with high peritumoral expression of both proteins had the longest median OS (>94.0 months) and TTR (>84.0 months). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that patients with high peritumoral expression of both NRP-1 and VEGFR-2 were more than 4 times less likely to have recurrence (p = 0.004) and more than 10 times likely to survive (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Peritumoral NRP-1 and VEGFR-2 expression is associated with prolonged TTR and extended OS of HCC patients and both may be useful as predictors of surgical outcome of HCC patients and explored as potential therapeutic targets.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Peng-Yuan Zhuang","Jian-Dong Wang","Zhao-Hui Tang","Xue-Ping Zhou","Yong Yang","Zhi-Wei Quan","Ying-Bin Liu","Jun Shen"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.2553","first_seen_on":"2014-10-22T11:03:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"22","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1440586565,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25333267?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25333267?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4294350","pmid":"25333267","pubdate":"2014-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Peritumoral Neuropilin-1 and VEGF receptor-2 expression increases time to recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing curative hepatectomy.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peritumoral-neuropilin1-vegf-receptor2-expression-increases-time-recurrence-hepatocellular-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5552343,"mean":6.3814313062833,"rank":3683569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1637829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5552343,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155320,"mean":8.4719105453938,"rank":97326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":50922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155320,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5336,"mean":1.7623797563261,"rank":2073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5336,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1948,"mean":1.804499229584,"rank":707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1948,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
