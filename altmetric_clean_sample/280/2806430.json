Many advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of this syndrome in human medicine, but much still is unknown. This comparative review will provide information regarding the history and pathophysiology of MODS in humans and discuss how MODS affects each major organ system in animals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004131","authors":["Osterbur, K.","Mann, F.A.","Kuroki, K.","DeClue, A."],"doi":"10.1111\/jvim.12364","endpage":"1151","first_seen_on":"2014-10-23T14:04:34+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1939-1676","0891-6640"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1414072968,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvim.12364\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvim.12364\/pdf","pmid":"24773159","pubdate":"2014-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"1141","subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome in Humans and Animals","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-organ-dysfunction-syndrome-humans-animals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6387788,"mean":5.9823105998994,"rank":4488364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1668040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6387788,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168640,"mean":8.1303066194655,"rank":105378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":55533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168640,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":703,"mean":1.9217806267806,"rank":330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":703,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.3048518518519,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
