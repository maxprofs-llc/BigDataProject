It has been considered that the reactions contribute to stabilizing the motion, but less evidence bridging between the rhythm reset and the dynamic stability of the gait has been provided. The present study tries to establish the relationship between them. To this end, we construct a simple dynamical system model of the human musculo-skeletal system interacting with the ground, whose joint kinematics during walking is constrained by a given periodic joint-angles-profile. We show first that the model can exhibit a stable limit cycle corresponding to the steady walking with no perturbations. The responses of the limit cycle oscillation are examined by applying a type of perturbations at various timings with various intensities, elucidating the stability of the model's walking when no phase reset is performed. We then observe that modifications of the periodic joint-angles-profile within a short time interval in response to the perturbation can alter the responses of the limit cycle oscillation and induce phase reset of the model's walking. It is shown that appropriate amounts of the phase reset can prevent the model from falling, even for the perturbation that induces falling in the case without the phase reset. This suggests that those phase resets can improve the dynamic stability of the gait. Moreover, the appropriate phase resets predicted by the model are compared with the experimentally observed phase resets during human stumbling reaction to show they share similar characteristics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f9","authors":["Yamasaki, Taiga","Nomura, Taishin","Sato, Shunsuke"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0303-2647(03)00118-7","first_seen_on":"2014-10-24T02:44:32+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["03032647","0303-2647"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Biosystems","last_mentioned_on":1414118588,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0303264703001187"],"pmid":"14568223","pubdate":"2003-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","computationalbiology"],"title":"Phase reset and dynamic stability during human gait ","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phase-reset-dynamic-stability-during-human-gait-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6907292,"mean":6.199899504449,"rank":3387742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2014923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6907292,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195960,"mean":7.5224988288369,"rank":94043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":80701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195960,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":2.7225382436261,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.56,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
