It is now recognized that the health burden from air pollution exposures that primarily occur in the rural indoors, from pollutants released during the incomplete combustion of solid fuels in households, may rival or even exceed the burden attributable to urban outdoor exposures. Few environmental epidemiological efforts have been devoted to this setting, however. We provide an overview of important available information on exposures and health effects related to household solid fuel use in India, with a view to inform health research priorities for household air pollution and facilitate being able to address air pollution within an integrated rural-urban framework in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003ce2","doi":"10.3402\/gha.v4i0.5638","first_seen_on":"2014-10-23T04:04:12+00:00","issns":["1654-9880"],"journal":"Global Health Action","last_mentioned_on":1414080463,"links":["http:\/\/www.globalhealthaction.net\/index.php\/gha\/article\/view\/5638"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.globalhealthaction.net\/index.php\/gha\/article\/view\/5638\/11992","pmid":"21987631","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Air pollution from household solid fuel combustion in India: an overview of exposure and health related information to inform health research priorities","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/air-pollution-household-solid-fuel-combustion-india-overview-exposure-health-related-information-inf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3055959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":931589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124437,"mean":8.1996684721465,"rank":81427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":30728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124437,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":672,"mean":4.4415856929955,"rank":558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":672,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":24.914285714286,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
