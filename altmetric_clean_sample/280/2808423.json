Beta-amyloid oligomers are associated closely with early synaptic loss in AD. However, it is still unknown which synaptic proteins are involved in the synaptotoxicity, and a direct comparison among the synaptic proteins should also be addressed. Here, we investigated changes in the expression of several presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins in primary neurons after treatment with a low-molecular weight and a high-molecular weight beta-amyloid oligomer. Both oligomers induced early neuronal dysfunction after 4\u2009h and significantly reduced presynaptic protein (synaptophysin, syntaxin, synapsin, and synaptotagmin) expression. However, the expression of postsynaptic proteins (PSD95, NMDAR2A\/B, and GluR2\/3), except NMDAR1 was not reduced, and some protein expression levels were increased. Glutamate treatment, which is correlated with postsynaptic activation, showed more postsynaptic-specific protein loss compared with beta-amyloid oligomer treatment. Finally, the caspase inhibitor zVAD and the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 attenuated presynaptic protein loss. Thus, our data showed changes in synaptic proteins by beta-amyloid oligomers, which provides an understanding of early synaptotoxicity and suggests new approaches for AD treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082af","authors":["Jang BG","In S","Choi B","Kim MJ"],"doi":"10.1097\/wnr.0000000000000260","first_seen_on":"2014-10-24T02:24:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0959-4965"],"issue":"16","journal":"NeuroReport","last_mentioned_on":1448145941,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/Abstract\/2014\/11120\/Beta_amyloid_oligomers_induce_early_loss_of.6.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25275636"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/2014\/11120\/Beta_amyloid_oligomers_induce_early_loss_of.6.pdf","pmid":"25275636","pubdate":"2014-11-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1281","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Beta-amyloid oligomers induce early loss of presynaptic proteins in primary neurons by caspase-dependent and proteasome-dependent mechanisms.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/betaamyloid-oligomers-induce-early-loss-presynaptic-proteins-primary-neurons-caspasedependent-protea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6589643,"mean":6.1155965899212,"rank":3134749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1967357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6589643,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170645,"mean":8.2238913058768,"rank":87241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":63981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170645,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1418,"mean":3.3644304869442,"rank":646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1418,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.6239393939394,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
