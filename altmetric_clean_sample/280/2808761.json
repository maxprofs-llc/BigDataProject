These profiles can be mimicked in everyday items for their uses in foods, beverages, cosmetics, perfumes, solvents, and biofuels. Here, we developed a systematic 'natural' way to derive these products via fermentative biosynthesis. Each ester fermentative pathway was designed as an exchangeable ester production module for generating two precursors- alcohols and acyl-CoAs that were condensed by an alcohol acyltransferase to produce a combinatorial library of unique esters. As a proof-of-principle, we coupled these ester modules with an engineered, modular, Escherichia coli chassis in a plug-and-play fashion to create microbial cell factories for enhanced anaerobic production of a butyrate ester library. We demonstrated tight coupling between the modular chassis and ester modules for enhanced product biosynthesis, an engineered phenotype useful for directed metabolic pathway evolution. Compared to the wildtype, the engineered cell factories yielded up to 48 fold increase in butyrate ester production from glucose.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5033cf058f6100030b8","doi":"10.1016\/j.ymben.2014.09.006","first_seen_on":"2014-10-24T04:41:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10967176"],"journal":"Metabolic Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1414125625,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1096717614001207"],"pmid":"25281839","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Engineering modular ester fermentative pathways in Escherichia coli ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/engineering-modular-ester-fermentative-pathways-escherichia-coli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4412571,"mean":4.825676177232,"rank":2358952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1335545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4412571,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121980,"mean":7.5406197132294,"rank":62106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":42836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121980,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208,"mean":2.6288792270531,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":6.1156666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
