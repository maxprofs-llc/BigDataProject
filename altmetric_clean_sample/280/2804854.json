A coumarin derivative possessing \u03b1-aculoside as a Michael acceptor effectively and irreversibly operated as a fluorescent probe in cells. Furthermore, \u03b1-aculosides exhibited cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083f3","authors":["Hiromasa Ikeda","Erika Kaneko","Shunsuke Okuzawa","Daisuke Takahashi","Kazunobu Toshima"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4ob01877j","endpage":"8835","first_seen_on":"2014-10-23T03:54:48+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1477-0539","1477-0520"],"issue":"44","journal":"Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1414036674,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2014\/OB\/C4OB01877J"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2014\/ob\/c4ob01877j","pmid":"25294088","pubdate":"2014-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"8832","subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Chemical and biological evaluation of unusual sugars, \u03b1-aculosides, as novel Michael acceptors","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemical-biological-evaluation-unusual-sugars-%CE%B1aculosides-novel-michael-acceptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1858633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2594155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124437,"mean":8.2802167057768,"rank":46413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":76326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124437,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1231,"mean":2.859074796748,"rank":512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1231,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.8307692307692,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
