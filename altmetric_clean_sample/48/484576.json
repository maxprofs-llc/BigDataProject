We therefore examined the impact on accuracy of repeated versus one-time testing, type-specific versus pooled detection, and assay analytic sensitivity. By using a nested case-control design from the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study, we selected women with incident cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or grade 3 (CIN2\/3; n = 325) and a random sample of women with <CIN2 as controls (n = 401). HPV DNA status was assessed using hybrid capture 2 (HC2), a pooled test for 13 HR-HPV types, and the linear array (LA) and the line blot assay (LBA), two PCR-based HPV genotyping assays, at enrollment and the 6-month follow-up visit. The relative sensitivity and specificity for different permutations of multiple measurements were compared to a single measurement using marginal regression models. We found that repeat detection of any HR-HPV (by HC2, LA, or LBA) and of type-specific persistence (by LA or LBA) were significantly more specific but less sensitive than use of a single time point measurement of any HR-HPV. Sensitivity decreased and specificity increased further when testing intervals were increased from 12 to 24 months. Including detection of borderline carcinogenic\/noncarcinogenic HPV types with HR-HPV types decreased specificity for repeat measures of HPV with no impact on sensitivity. Similar patterns were observed when we used a CIN3 end point. We conclude that assay performance for detecting incident CIN2\/3 was affected by which types were included, the analytic sensitivity of the assay, and the testing interval. These trade-offs need to be considered when assessing the potential overall clinical utility of repeated testing for HR-HPV DNA to identify women at risk for CIN2\/3.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","doi":"10.1128\/jcm.05979-11","first_seen_on":"2011-12-08T12:30:23+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1098-660X"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1323331025,"links":["http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/content\/early\/2011\/12\/01\/JCM.05979-11.abstract?etoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcm.asm.org\/content\/early\/2011\/12\/01\/JCM.05979-11.full.pdf","pmid":"22162556","pubdate":"2011-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Evaluation of any or type-specific persistence of high-risk human papillomavirus for detecting cervical precancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-typespecific-persistence-highrisk-human-papillomavirus-detecting-cervical-precancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":2319011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1559158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232212,"mean":4.2119421560566,"rank":100145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":97117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232212,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2952,"mean":2.730349711962,"rank":1493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2952,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":2.4479384615385,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
