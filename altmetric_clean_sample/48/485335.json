Since then, this analysis has taken hold as the most comprehensive way to quantify ventricular chamber function and energetics and cardiovascular interactions. First studied in large mammalian hearts and later in humans employing a catheter-based method, P-V analysis was translated to small rodents in the late 1990s by the Kass laboratory. Over the past decade, this approach has become a gold standard for comprehensive examination of in vivo cardiac function in mice, facilitating a new era of molecular cardiac physiology. The catheter-based method remains the most widely used approach in mice. In this brief review, we discuss this instrumentation, the theory behind its use, and how volume signals are calibrated and discuss elements of P-V analysis. The goal is to provide a convenient summary of earlier investigations and insights for users whose primary interests lie in genetic\/molecular studies rather than in biomedical engineering.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002210","doi":"10.1152\/ajpheart.00781.2011","first_seen_on":"2011-12-08T13:34:57+00:00","issns":["1522-1539"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Heart & Circulatory Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1323284667,"links":["http:\/\/ajpheart.physiology.org\/content\/301\/6\/H2198.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajpheart.physiology.org\/content\/301\/6\/H2198.full.pdf","pmid":"21926344","pubdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","cardiology"],"title":"Pressure-volume relation analysis of mouse ventricular function","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pressurevolume-relation-analysis-mouse-ventricular-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3094619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":969163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232213,"mean":4.2119455497565,"rank":145164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232213,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1087,"mean":1.9473683241252,"rank":623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1087,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":0.7070652173913,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
