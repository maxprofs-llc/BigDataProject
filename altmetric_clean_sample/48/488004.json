While the optimal preventive strategy has not been defined, most centers rely on universal prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy. This article comments on recent studies designed to identify strategies that effectively reduce the incidence of late-onset CMV disease as the main problem associated with prophylaxis, and on recent data regarding the development of CMV-specific immunity depending on the CMV-preventive regimen used. Despite an apparent trend to prefer prophylaxis in clinical practice, this approach does not seem to be based on robust evidence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073ca","authors":["Tom\u00e1\u0161 Reischig"],"doi":"10.1586\/eri.11.156","endpage":"61","first_seen_on":"2011-12-10T12:53:44+00:00","issns":["1478-7210","1744-8336"],"issue":"1","journal":"Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1323521048,"links":["http:\/\/www.expert-reviews.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/eri.11.156"],"pmid":"22149614","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"51","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Advances in cytomegalovirus-preventive strategies in solid organ transplantation: defending pre-emptive therapy","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/advances-cytomegaloviruspreventive-strategies-solid-organ-transplantation-defending-preemptive-thera"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3094576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":969139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231791,"mean":4.2114174036847,"rank":144964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231791,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":372,"mean":2.8443827493261,"rank":263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":372,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.295,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/takashinzato\/status\/145483937718874112","citation_ids":[488004],"posted_on":"2011-12-10T12:44:08+00:00","author":{"name":"\u65b0\u91cc \u656c","url":"http:\/\/twilog.org\/takashinzato","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1082751989\/takashin_normal.jpg","description":"\u533b\u5e2b\uff08\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u30fb\u7dcf\u5408\u5185\u79d1\uff09\u3000Internist; Infectious Diseases & General Internal Medicine\r\n\u81e8\u5e8a\u6559\u80b2\u306b\u3082\u529b\u3092\u6ce8\u3044\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002","id_on_source":"takashinzato","tweeter_id":"120432163","geo":{"lt":26.33583,"ln":127.80139,"country":"JP"},"followers":679},"tweet_id":"145483937718874112"}]}}
