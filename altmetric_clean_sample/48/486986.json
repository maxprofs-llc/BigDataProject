The mother had received bupropion, an antidepressant and aid to smoking cessation, throughout pregnancy. The infant presented with profound hypoglycemia and seizures on the 3rd day of life. Laboratory investigation confirmed hyperinsulinism. Stable euglycemia could be achieved only after starting diazoxide. The infant was weaned from diazoxide by 10 weeks of age without recurrence of hypoglycemia, signifying the transient nature of hyperinsulinism. This is the first reported case of a potential association between maternal bupropion use during pregnancy and neonatal hyperinsulinism, and highlights the importance of close monitoring of similar infants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dce","first_seen_on":"2011-12-09T13:23:41+00:00","issns":["0334-018X"],"issue":"9-10","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1323435727,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22145484?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22145484","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology","pediatrics"],"title":"Hyperinsulinism associated with gestational exposure to bupropion in a newborn infant.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyperinsulinism-associated-gestational-exposure-bupropion-newborn-infant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2907187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228618,"mean":3.9436401142524,"rank":164901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228618,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257,"mean":2.6679296875,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.8970909090909,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
