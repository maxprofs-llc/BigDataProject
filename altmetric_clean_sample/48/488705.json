Most of the literature on the immune effects of anesthetics has been derived from in vitro or animal studies, due to the number of confounding variables in real life surgical settings. These immunosuppressive effects might not normally have clinical consequences for an immune-competent patient, but may act as important modifiers in postoperative morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, some inhibitory effects on neutrophil functions may provide a therapeutically beneficial effect under specific surgical clinical conditions, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9113cf058f61000cc83","first_seen_on":"2011-12-11T17:53:42+00:00","issns":["0394-6320"],"issue":"3 Suppl","journal":"International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1325675888,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22014921?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22014921","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pathology","pharmacology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Immunological modifications induced from products used during the perioperative period.","type":"article","volume":"24"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3521220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":134556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232308,"mean":4.1824111886429,"rank":178692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232308,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":2.3452621359223,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":4.5925,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/ACNPed\/status\/145920549770633216","citation_ids":[488705],"posted_on":"2011-12-11T17:39:04+00:00","author":{"name":"ACNP","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687251577\/logo_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Neumolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","id_on_source":"ACNPed","tweeter_id":"434250807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":157},"tweet_id":"145920549770633216"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/ACNPed\/status\/154521991326609408","citation_ids":[488705],"posted_on":"2012-01-04T11:18:08+00:00","author":{"name":"ACNP","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687251577\/logo_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Neumolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","id_on_source":"ACNPed","tweeter_id":"434250807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":157},"tweet_id":"154521991326609408"}]}}
