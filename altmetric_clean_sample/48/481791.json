This study investigated the possible ameliorating effect of \u03b21-blocker, metoprolol (MTP), against both hypertensive and nephrotoxic effects of cyclosporine A (CSA). Compared with vehicle (olive oil)-treated rats, chronic treatment with CSA (20 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d subcutaneous, for 14 days) increased systolic blood pressure, elevated renal function indices and plasma renin activity, impaired renovascular responsiveness of isolated perfused rat kidneys to endothelium-dependent vasodilations induced by carbachol. These effects were abolished upon concurrent administration of MTP (5 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d for 14 days, intraperitoneal). The possibility that alterations in the antioxidant and\/or circulating cytokine levels contributed to the CSA-MTP interaction was also investigated. MTP abrogated the oxidative (superoxide dismutase, catalase), lipid peroxidation (malondialdyde), and elevated the cytokine (TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2) effects of CSA. Histologically, CSA caused tubular brush border loss and isometric vacuolization clustered in the proximal tubule; this effect disappeared in rats cotreated with MTP. The use of a nonhypotensive dose of MTP (1.25 mg\/kg) countered in part endothelium dysfunction altered oxidative stress parameters and cytokine levels in CSA-treated rats. Collectively, MTP abrogates both the hypertensive and the nephrotoxic effects of CSA via ameliorating endothelium dysfunction, oxidative stress, and upregulated cytokine levels caused by CSA. The demonstration of nephroprotection by the low dose of MTP suggests that its renal effect may be partially unrelated to its hemodynamic activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb9","doi":"10.1097\/fjc.0b013e318231166f","first_seen_on":"2011-12-06T16:15:19+00:00","issns":["0160-2446"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1324227712,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/9000\/00000\/Metoprolol_ameliorates_cyclosporine_A_induced.99434.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/Abstract\/2011\/12000\/Metoprolol_Ameliorates_Cyclosporine_A_induced.12.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/9000\/00000\/Metoprolol_ameliorates_cyclosporine_A_induced.99434.pdf","pmid":"21885994","pubdate":"2011-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"","subjects":["pharmacology","cardiology"],"title":"Metoprolol Ameliorates Cyclosporine A\u2013induced Hypertension and Nephrotoxicity in Rats","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metoprolol-ameliorates-cyclosporine-ainduced-hypertension-nephrotoxicity-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":3108257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1008977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231547,"mean":4.1595466041307,"rank":144450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":58692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231547,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1013,"mean":1.7545098814229,"rank":721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1013,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.148125,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/JofCVPonline\/status\/144083805559472128","citation_ids":[481791],"posted_on":"2011-12-06T16:00:30+00:00","author":{"name":"JofCVPharmacology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611389347\/JCVPharma_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief: Michael R.
