DNA sequencing with ddNTPs or terminators was developed by (1). The progressive automation of the method by combining the use of fluorescent-dye terminators with cycle sequencing has made it possible to increase the sensibility and efficiency of the method and hence has allowed its introduction into the forensic field. PCR-generated mitochondrial DNA products are the templates for sequencing reactions. Different set of primers can be used to generate amplicons with different sizes according to the quality and quantity of the DNA extract providing sequence data for different ranges inside the Control Region.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","doi":"10.1007\/978-1-61779-461-2_19","first_seen_on":"2011-12-06T11:50:18+00:00","issns":["1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1323172039,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22139667?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22139667","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Capillary Electrophoresis of Big-Dye Terminator Sequencing Reactions for Human mtDNA Control Region Haplotyping in the Identification of Human Remains.","type":"article","volume":"830","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/capillary-electrophoresis-bigdye-terminator-sequencing-reactions-human-mtdna-control-region-haplotyp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":983894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231552,"mean":4.1819076834048,"rank":145292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":52833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231552,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3194,"mean":1.3544008769183,"rank":1459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3194,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":1.3676466165414,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
