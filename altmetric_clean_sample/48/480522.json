During hypoxia, cells activate an anaerobic switch that favors glycolysis and attenuates the mitochondrial activity. This switch involves the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1). We have identified a HIF-1 target gene, the mitochondrial NDUFA4L2 (NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex, 4-like 2). Our results, obtained employing NDUFA4L2-silenced cells and NDUFA4L2 knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts, indicate that hypoxia-induced NDUFA4L2 attenuates mitochondrial oxygen consumption involving inhibition of Complex I activity, which limits the intracellular ROS production under low-oxygen conditions. Thus, reducing mitochondrial Complex I activity via NDUFA4L2 appears to be an essential element in the mitochondrial reprogramming induced by HIF-1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067cf","doi":"10.1016\/j.cmet.2011.10.008","first_seen_on":"2011-12-05T19:46:52+00:00","issns":["1932-7420"],"journal":"Cell Metabolism (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1326240000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22100406"],"pmid":"22100406","pubdate":"2011-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"Induction of the Mitochondrial NDUFA4L2 Protein by HIF-1\u03b1 Decreases Oxygen Consumption by Inhibiting Complex I Activity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/induction-mitochondrial-ndufa4l2-protein-hif1%CE%B1-decreases-oxygen-consumption-inhibiting-complex-i-act"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628597,"mean":4.9402458135364,"rank":2017014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":936729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628597,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227528,"mean":3.9161892874255,"rank":98130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":89351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227528,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":896,"mean":13.44156424581,"rank":613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":896,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":6.7916703296703,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":28,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
