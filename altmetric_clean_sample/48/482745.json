Gain-of-function mutations and variants (single amino acid substitutions) of NaV1.7 have been linked to three pain syndromes: Inherited Erythromelalgia (IEM), Paroxysmal Extreme Pain Disorder (PEPD), and Small Fiber Neuropathy (SFN). IEM is characterized clinically by burning pain and redness that is usually focused on the distal extremities, precipitated by mild warmth and relieved by cooling, and is caused by mutations that hyperpolarize activation, slow deactivation, and enhance the channel ramp response. PEPD is characterized by perirectal, periocular or perimandibular pain, often triggered by defecation or lower body stimulation, and is caused by mutations that severely impair fast-inactivation. SFN presents a clinical picture dominated by neuropathic pain and autonomic symptoms; gain-of-function variants have been reported to be present in approximately 30% of patients with biopsy-confirmed idiopathic SFN, and functional testing has shown altered fast-inactivation, slow-inactivation or resurgent current. In this paper we describe three patients who house the NaV1.7\/I228M variant.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000875","authors":["Mark Estacion","Mark Estacion","Chongyang Han","Jin-Sung Choi","Janneke GJ Hoeijmakers","Giuseppe Lauria","Joost PH Drenth","Monique M Gerrits","Sulayman D Dib-Hajj","Catharina G Faber","Ingemar SJ Merkies","Stephen G Waxman"],"doi":"10.1186\/1744-8069-7-92","first_seen_on":"2011-12-07T00:13:35+00:00","issns":["","1744-8069"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Pain","last_mentioned_on":1344870005,"links":["http:\/\/www.molecularpain.com\/content\/7\/1\/92\/abstract"],"pmid":"22136189","pubdate":"2011-12-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"92","subjects":["molecularbiology","psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Intra- and interfamily phenotypic diversity in pain syndromes associated with a gain-of-function variant of Na V 1.7","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intra-interfamily-phenotypic-diversity-pain-syndromes-associated-gainoffunction-variant-na-subvsub-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":2745480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":725030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228339,"mean":3.9230382590723,"rank":145509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":64251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228339,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232,"mean":2.7677229437229,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.3212,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Ph.
