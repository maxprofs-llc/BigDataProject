We retrospectively analyzed the prevalence of CKD and anemia in 312 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The patients were divided into four groups according to the presence of CKD and anemia. Chronic kidney disease was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2), and anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization definition. Of 312 AMI patients, 166 (53.2%) had CKD and 87 (27.8%) had anemia. A powerful relationship was observed between both CKD and anemia and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) or death by any cause. After adjustment for comorbidities, the hazard ratio (HR) for MACCE was significantly higher in the anemia-only group (HR 5.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38-21.27, P = 0.015), the CKD-only group (HR 6.4, 95% CI 2.09-19.58, P = 0.001), and the CKD and anemia group (HR 11.61, 95% CI 3.65-36.89, P < 0.001). With respect to death by any cause, the HR was significantly higher in the CKD-only group (HR 2.68, 95% CI 1.02-7.02, P = 0.045) and the CKD and anemia group (HR 4.40, 95% CI 1.56-12.43, P = 0.005). One-half of the patients with AMI had CKD as well. Furthermore, when anemia coexisted with CKD, these conditions had a multiplicative amplification effect on the risk of MACCE and death by any cause in patients with AMI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029ce","authors":["Yuya Matsue","Akihiko Matsumura","Masami Abe","Maki Ono","Mie Seya","Tomofumi Nakamura","Ryota Iwatsuka","Akira Mizukami","Masahiko Setoguchi","Wataru Nagahori","Masakazu Ohno","Makoto Suzuki","Yuji Hashimoto"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00380-011-0209-2","first_seen_on":"2011-12-11T19:43:58+00:00","issns":["0910-8327","1615-2573"],"journal":"Heart & Vessels","last_mentioned_on":1323631322,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/ym84mk6832651840\/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22160439","pubdate":"2011-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Prognostic implications of chronic kidney disease and anemia after percutaneous coronary intervention in acute myocardial infarction patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-implications-chronic-kidney-disease-anemia-after-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-acute-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635048,"mean":4.9225817734301,"rank":2900864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635048,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228844,"mean":3.884681786203,"rank":163177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228844,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":1.2505,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.35416666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/CardiologiaF\/status\/145946460708536321","citation_ids":[488765],"posted_on":"2011-12-11T19:22:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiolog\u00eda-Fabumed","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1561758151\/fabumed_normal.png","description":"Cardiolog\u00eda.
