In the case of scandium, addition of Sc(CH(2)SiMe(3))(3)(THF)(2) to (ArNP(i)Pr(2))(3)Sc(THF) affords (ArNP(i)Pr(2))(2)Sc(CH(2)SiMe(3))(THF), which has been isolated and structurally characterized. In contrast, addition of Y(CH(2)SiMe(3))(3)(THF)(2) to (ArNP(i)Pr(2))(3)Y(THF) generates a distribution of phosphinoamide-containing products consistent with the formulations (ArNP(i)Pr(2))(2)Y(CH(2)SiMe(3))(THF) and (ArNP(i)Pr(2))Y(CH(2)SiMe(3))(2)(THF), as ascertained using NMR spectroscopy. Attempts to react the alkyl-containing phosphinoamide complexes with small molecules such as H(2) led to disproportionation type processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Nathan R.
