There is increasing evidence for a prognostic significance of pretherapeutically elevated serum C-reactive protein levels in various cancers. However, little is known about its significance in patients with invasive bladder cancer. This study shows that serum CRP is an independent predictor for cancer-specific survival in bladder cancer, and its incorporation into a new outcome model (TNR-C Score) encompassing major pathological determinants for survival, increases significantly its predictive accuracy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245a","authors":["Gakis, Georgios","Todenh\u00f6fer, Tilman","Renninger, Markus","Schilling, David","Sievert, Karl\u2010Dietrich","Schwentner, Christian","Stenzl, Arnulf"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1464-410x.2011.10234.x","endpage":"1805","first_seen_on":"2011-12-05T15:42:07+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1464-410X","1464-4096"],"issue":"11","journal":"British Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1323098786,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2011.10234.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2011.10234.x\/pdf","pmid":"21507193","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1800","title":"Development of a new outcome prediction model in carcinoma invading the bladder based on preoperative serum C\u00e2\u0080\u0090reactive protein and standard pathological risk factors: the TNR\u00e2\u0080\u0090C score","type":"article","volume":"108","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-new-outcome-prediction-model-carcinoma-invading-bladder-based-preoperative-serum-creacti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2978982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1397117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231064,"mean":4.15672467682,"rank":136131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":86654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231064,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2241,"mean":5.1607928571429,"rank":1601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2241,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":2.5013492063492,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":12,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/BJUIjournal\/status\/143712844691677185","citation_ids":[480223],"posted_on":"2011-12-05T15:26:26+00:00","author":{"name":"BJU International","url":"http:\/\/www.bjuinternational.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/816208325289345024\/Q1l88hAh_normal.jpg","description":"BJUI provides the highest standard of research and clinical info, promoting awareness of advances and supporting best practice | Editor @prokarurol | IF 4.439","id_on_source":"BJUIjournal","tweeter_id":"64674223","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":9845},"tweet_id":"143712844691677185"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Development of a new outcome prediction model in carcinoma invading the bladder based on preoperativ","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=228948117179033&id=90373942404","citation_ids":[480223],"posted_on":"2011-12-05T15:26:25+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2011.10234.x\/abstract\nThere is increasing evidence for a prognostic significance of pretherapeutically elevated serum C-reactive protein levels in various cancers.
