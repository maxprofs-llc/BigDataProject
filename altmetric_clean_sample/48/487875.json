To date, proteins with repeating resilin motifs have been expressed with molecular weights less than 30 kDa. This work describes the development of resilin-based proteins (repeating motif derived from Anopheles gambiae) 50 kDa in size. A modular cloning scheme was utilized and features a recursive cloning technique that can seamlessly and precisely tune the number of resilin repeats. Previously-established resilin expression protocols (based on the Studier auto-induction method) were employed to express the proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Western blot and densitometry results demonstrated that only ~50% of expressed proteins were the desired molecular weight. This finding suggested that either protein truncation or degradation occurred during protein expression. Preventing leaky expression, lowering the culture temperature, and harvesting during exponential phase resulted in up to 94% of the expressed proteins having the desired molecular weight. These expression conditions differ from previously-published resilin expression methods and are recommended when expressing proteins with a larger number of repetitive resilin sequences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033ca","doi":"10.1016\/j.pep.2011.11.019","first_seen_on":"2011-12-10T07:46:33+00:00","issns":["10465928"],"journal":"Protein Expression & Purification","last_mentioned_on":1323502963,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSCONTENT&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1046592811003469&_version=1&md5=1f47fab0232c36c257a43070ca68a3ba&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmid":"22173203","pubdate":"2011-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Modular Cloning and Protein Expression of Long, Repetitive Resilin-based Proteins ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modular-cloning-protein-expression-long-repetitive-resilinbased-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3537812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":135248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231791,"mean":4.2114217179346,"rank":181738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231791,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":401,"mean":1.542665,"rank":262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":401,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.125,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
