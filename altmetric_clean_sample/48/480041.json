Systems biology aims to understand the system through the study of the relationship between elements such as genes and proteins in biological system. Recently, systems biology emerged as the result of the advanced development of high-throughput analysis technologies such as DNA sequencers, DNA arrays, and mass spectrometry for omics studies. Among a number of analytical tools and technologies, CE and CE coupled to MS are promising and relatively rapidly developing tools with the potential to provide qualitative and quantitative analyses of biological molecules. With an emphasis on CE for systems biology, this review summarizes the method developments and applications of CE for the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies focusing on the drug discovery and disease diagnosis and therapies since 2009.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f61000722d","authors":["Ban, Eunmi","Park, Soo Hyun","Kang, Min\u2010Jung","Lee, Hyun\u2010Jung","Song, Eun Joo","Yoo, Young Sook"],"doi":"10.1002\/elps.201100344","first_seen_on":"2011-12-05T11:58:05+00:00","issns":["0173-0835","1522-2683"],"issue":"1","journal":"Electrophoresis","last_mentioned_on":1323085097,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002%2Felps.201100344?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22139583","pubdate":"2011-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Growing trend of CE at the omics level: The frontier of systems biology \u2013 An update","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/growing-trend-ce-omics-level-frontier-systems-biology-update"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":983881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231069,"mean":4.1784275711048,"rank":145012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":52677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231069,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":999,"mean":0.98027254509018,"rank":284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":999,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248,"mean":0.5477975708502,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Ph.
