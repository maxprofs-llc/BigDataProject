CagA also binds to partitioning-defective 1 (PAR1) polarity-regulating kinase via the CagA multimerization (CM) sequence. To investigate pathophysiological role of CagA-SHP2 and\/or CagA-PAR1 interaction in H. pylori infection, we generated H. pylori isogenic strains producing a phosphorylation-resistant CagA and a CagA without CM sequence. Infection studies revealed that deregulation of epithelial cell motility was more prominent in the wild-type strain than in the mutant strains. Thus, both CagA-SHP2 and CagA-PAR1 interactions are involved in the pathogenicity of cagA-positive H. pylori.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c1","doi":"10.1016\/j.micinf.2011.12.003","first_seen_on":"2011-12-12T06:07:43+00:00","issns":["12864579"],"journal":"Microbes & Infection","last_mentioned_on":1324157742,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1286457911003078"],"pmid":"22202178","pubdate":"2011-12-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Masson SAS","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Helicobacter pylori stimulates epithelial cell migration via CagA-mediated perturbation of host cell signaling","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/helicobacter-pylori-stimulates-epithelial-cell-migration-via-cagamediated-perturbation-host-cell-sig"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2911340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1443949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232618,"mean":4.2487071538197,"rank":132521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232618,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":767,"mean":4.536138381201,"rank":566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":767,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.9661764705882,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
