Homozygosity mapping in this family showed lack of linkage to any of the previously known AR-OI genes, but revealed a 10.27 MB homozygous region on chromosome 8p in the two affected sibs, which comprised the procollagen I C-terminal propeptide (PICP) endopeptidase gene BMP1. Mutation analysis identified both patients with a Phe249Leu homozygous missense change within the BMP1 protease domain involving a residue, which is conserved in all members of the astacin group of metalloproteases. Type I procollagen analysis in supernatants from cultured fibroblasts demonstrated abnormal PICP processing in patient-derived cells consistent with the mutation causing decreased BMP1 function. This was further confirmed by overexpressing wild type and mutant BMP1 longer isoform (mammalian Tolloid protein [mTLD]) in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human primary fibroblasts. While overproduction of normal mTLD resulted in a large proportion of pro\u03b11(I) in the culture media being C-terminally processed, pro\u03b11(I) cleavage was not enhanced by an excess of the mutant protein, proving that the Phe249Leu mutation leads to a BMP1\/mTLD protein with deficient PICP proteolytic activity. We conclude that BMP1 is an additional gene mutated in AR-OI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000767d","authors":["Mart\u00ednez\u2010Glez, V\u00edctor","Valencia, Maria","Caparr\u00f3s\u2010Mart\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 A.","Aglan, Mona","Temtamy, Samia","Tenorio, Jair","Pulido, Veronica","Lindert, Uschi","Rohrbach, Marianne","Eyre, David","Giunta, Cecilia","Lapunzina, Pablo","Ruiz\u2010Perez, Victor L."],"doi":"10.1002\/humu.21647","endpage":"350","first_seen_on":"2011-12-12T17:29:30+00:00","funders":["niams"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1098-1004","1059-7794"],"issue":"2","journal":"Human Mutation","last_mentioned_on":1328140800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22052668","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/humu.21647\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/humu.21647\/pdf","pmid":"22052668","pubdate":"2011-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"343","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Identification of a mutation causing deficient BMP1\/mTLD proteolytic activity in autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-mutation-causing-deficient-bmp1mtld-proteolytic-activity-autosomal-recessive-osteogen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":260576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":3367925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229140,"mean":3.8993066653868,"rank":15765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":213273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229140,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1121,"mean":2.5476678571429,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1121,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":1.3059529411765,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
