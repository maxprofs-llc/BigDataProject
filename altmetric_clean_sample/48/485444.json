Here, we report a 61-year-old man with acute right-sided suppurative thyroiditis without pyriform sinus fistula. He also showed infectious hip arthritis, spondylitis and Roth's spots. He presented with heart failure and was diagnosed with infectious endocarditis by sequential transesophageal echocardiography. A replacement with a prosthetic valve was performed and cured him. It is important to recognize that infectious endocarditis can be a focus of acute suppurative thyroiditis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61c3cf058f6100077d5","first_seen_on":"2011-12-08T13:46:24+00:00","issns":["1349-7235"],"issue":"23","journal":"Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1323278715,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22129504"],"pmid":"22129504","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Right-sided acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by infectious endocarditis.","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rightsided-acute-suppurative-thyroiditis-caused-infectious-endocarditis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729490,"mean":5.5013917665933,"rank":2445175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1659677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729490,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232981,"mean":4.4129825907804,"rank":100176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":100967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232981,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":689,"mean":1.8443052325581,"rank":240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":689,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.0779069767442,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
