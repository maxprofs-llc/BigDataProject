Adiponectin is secreted by adipose tissue and acts in the brain and peripheral organs to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. Adiponectin deficiency predisposes toward metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular morbidity. To investigate the relationship between metabolic syndrome and seizures, wild-type C57BL\/6J and adiponectin knock-out mice were fed a high-fat diet, followed by treatment with low doses of kainic acid to induce seizures. Adiponectin deficiency in mice fed a high-fat diet resulted in greater fat accumulation, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidemia, increased seizure severity, and increased hippocampal pathology. In contrast, there were no adverse effects of adiponectin deficiency on metabolic phenotype or seizure activity in mice fed a normal (low-fat) chow diet. These findings demonstrate that metabolic syndrome modulates the outcome of seizures and brain injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.3171-11.2011","first_seen_on":"2011-12-05T19:53:26+00:00","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"40","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1322611200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21976521"],"pmid":"21976521","pubdate":"2011-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Metabolic dysfunction associated with adiponectin deficiency enhances kainic acid-induced seizure severity.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-dysfunction-associated-adiponectin-deficiency-enhances-kainic-acidinduced-seizure-severity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":2016435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227565,"mean":3.883380833524,"rank":97511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227565,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9099,"mean":6.1143816223346,"rank":4973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9099,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273,"mean":3.4904779411765,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
