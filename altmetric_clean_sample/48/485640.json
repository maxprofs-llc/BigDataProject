The internal microstructure of the particles is imaged through TEM. CSLM is used to identify the location of the Ge molecules in the microgels. Through indentation tests, the Young's modulus of the individual particles is found to be 22 \u00b1 2.5 kPa. The overall shear modulus of the composite is 75 \u00b1 15 Pa at 1 Hz. The mechanical properties of the substrate are found to be viable for cell adhesion. The particles' diameter at pH = 8 is twice that at pH = 5. The pH sensitivity is found to be appropriate for smart drug delivery. Based on their mechanical and structural properties, HA-Ge hierarchical materials may be well suited for use as injectable biomaterials for tissue reconstruction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008093","authors":["Heris, Hossein K.","Rahmat, Meysam","Mongeau, Luc"],"doi":"10.1002\/mabi.201100335","endpage":"210","first_seen_on":"2011-12-08T14:06:38+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1616-5195","1616-5187"],"issue":"2","journal":"Macromolecular Bioscience","last_mentioned_on":1323270425,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/mabi.201100335"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201100335\/pdf","pmid":"22147507","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"202","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Characterization of a Hierarchical Network of Hyaluronic Acid\/Gelatin Composite for use as a Smart Injectable Biomaterial","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-hierarchical-network-hyaluronic-acidgelatin-composite-smart-injectable-biomaterial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633986,"mean":4.9208287981427,"rank":2897597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633986,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228709,"mean":3.8926882487716,"rank":163129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228709,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":689,"mean":1.163851744186,"rank":295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":689,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171,"mean":0.87764705882353,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
