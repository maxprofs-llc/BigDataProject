PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) have been shown to participate in atherosclerosis, arteriogenesis, cerebral edema, neuroprotection, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, postischemic brain and vessel repair, and the effects of transplanted stem cells in experimental stroke. Most of these actions involve VEGF-A and the VEGFR-2 receptor, but VEGF-B, placental growth factor, and VEGFR-1 have been implicated in some cases as well. VEGF signaling pathways represent important potential targets for the acute and chronic treatment of stroke.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c7","doi":"10.1007\/s00018-013-1282-8","first_seen_on":"2013-03-12T10:24:49+00:00","issns":["1420-9071"],"journal":"Cellular & Molecular Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1363089833,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23475070?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23475070","pubdate":"2013-03-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and stroke.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vascular-endothelial-growth-factors-vegfs-stroke-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4203711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93348,"mean":6.673020450577,"rank":76243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93348,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1169,"mean":2.919897260274,"rank":988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1169,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":2.3888888888889,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
