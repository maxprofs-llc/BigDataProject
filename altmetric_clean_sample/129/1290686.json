Patients with hypercalciuria often excrete more calcium than they absorb, indicating a net loss of total-body calcium. The source of this additional urinary calcium is almost certainly the skeleton, the largest repository of calcium in the body. Hypercalciuric stone formers exhibit decreased bone mineral density (BMD), which is correlated with the increase in urine calcium excretion. The decreased BMD also correlates with an increase in markers of bone turnover as well as increased fractures. In humans, it is difficult to determine the cause of the decreased BMD in hypercalciuric stone formers. To study the effect of hypercalciuria on bone, we utilized our genetic hypercalciuric stone-forming (GHS) rats, which were developed through successive inbreeding of the most hypercalciuric Sprague-Dawley rats. GHS rats excrete significantly more urinary calcium than similarly fed controls, and all the GHS rats form kidney stones while control rats do not. The hypercalciuria is due to a systemic dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, with increased intestinal calcium absorption, enhanced bone mineral resorption, and decreased renal tubule calcium reabsorption associated with an increase in vitamin D receptors in all these target tissues. We recently found that GHS rats fed an ample calcium diet have reduced BMD and that their bones are more fracture-prone, indicating an intrinsic disorder of bone not secondary to diet. Using this model, we should better understand the pathogenesis of hypercalciuria and stone formation in humans to ultimately improve the bone health of patients with kidney stones.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002483","authors":["Nancy S.
