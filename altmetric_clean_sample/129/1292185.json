TRAP contains two adhesive domains responsible for host cell recognition and invasion, and is known to be essential for infectivity. In the present paper, we report high-resolution crystal structures of the A domain of Plasmodium falciparum TRAP with and without bound Mg2+. The structure reveals a vWA (von Willebrand factor A)-like fold and a functional MIDAS (metal-ion-dependent adhesion site), as well as a potential heparan sulfate-binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis and cell-attachment assays were used to investigate the functional roles of the surface epitopes discovered. The reported structures are the first determined for a complete vWA domain of parasitic origin, highlighting unique features among homologous domains from other proteins characterized hitherto. Some of these are conserved among Plasmodiae exclusively, whereas others may be common to apicomplexan organisms in general.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["Pihlajamaa T","Tero Pihlajamaa","Tommi Kajander","Juho Knuuti","Kaisa Horkka","Amit Sharma","Perttu Permi"],"doi":"10.1042\/bj20121058","first_seen_on":"2013-03-10T10:21:08+00:00","issns":["0264-6021"],"journal":"Biochemical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1362915394,"links":["http:\/\/www.biochemj.org\/bj\/450\/bj4500469.htm"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biochemj.org\/bj\/450\/0469\/4500469.pdf","pmid":"23317521","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Portland Press Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Structure of Plasmodium falciparum TRAP (thrombospondin-related anonymous protein) A domain highlights distinct features in apicomplexan von Willebrand factor A homologues","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-plasmodium-falciparum-trap-thrombospondinrelated-anonymous-protein-domain-highlights-disti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":3351514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1480736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93437,"mean":6.694365212552,"rank":58027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":31058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93437,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3937,"mean":2.4692479674797,"rank":2994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3937,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.3594545454545,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
