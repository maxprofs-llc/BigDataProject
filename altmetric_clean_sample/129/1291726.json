These juveniles clearly differ morphologically from all known nematodes. Morphological and molecular analyses indicate a position within the Filaroidea. The aberrant biology of this nematode, namely, a free-living stage in an aquatic environment, is unknown within this superfamily, and the evolution of the parasitic phenotype to a free-living state is generally thought to be unlikely. However, the obtained placement in the small subunit molecular phylogenetic tree suggests that this free-living stage is most likely a secondary adaptation. It is reasonable to assert that nematodes with complex life cycles still have the genetic potential for a reversion from parasitism to a (partial) free-living stage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc2","authors":["Bert W","Messiaen M","Manhout J","Houthoofd W","Borgonie G"],"doi":"10.1645\/ge-672r.1","first_seen_on":"2013-03-09T20:34:11+00:00","issns":["0022-3395"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1370979573,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16884014"],"pmid":"16884014","pubdate":"2006-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Evolutionary loss of parasitism by nematodes?
