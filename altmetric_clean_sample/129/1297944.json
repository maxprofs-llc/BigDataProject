Following several outstanding developments in the areas of separation methods, spectroscopic techniques, and sensitive bioassays, natural product research has gained new attention for providing novel chemical entities. This updated review deals with sample preparation and purification, recent extraction techniques used for natural product separation, liquid-solid and liquid-liquid isolation techniques, as well as multi-step chromatographic operations. It covers examples of papers published since the NPR review 'Modern separation methods' by Marston and Hostettmann,1 with major emphasis on methods developed and the research undertaken since 2000.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f61000315d","authors":["Otto Sticher"],"doi":"10.1039\/b700306b","first_seen_on":"2013-03-13T04:44:53+00:00","issns":["1460-4752"],"issue":"3","journal":"Natural Product Reports","last_mentioned_on":1363149841,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2008\/NP\/b700306b"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2008\/np\/b700306b","pmid":"18497897","pubdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"517","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Natural product isolation","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/natural-product-isolation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":2018633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85510,"mean":6.2262442549907,"rank":43440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":27023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85510,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290,"mean":3.1953148788927,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":24,"Researcher":51,"Student  > Ph.
