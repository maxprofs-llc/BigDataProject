Our findings pave the way to use nanomaterials for the design and development of efficient biomimetic catalysts and, more significantly, to apply ionic liquid as a positive modulator in catalytic reactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Youhui Lin"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja400280f","first_seen_on":"2013-03-11T16:41:46+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1363966756,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja400280f","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja400280f?ref=tw&"],"pmid":"23469900","pubdate":"2013-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Ionic Liquid as an Efficient Modulator on Artificial Enzyme System: Toward the Realization of High-Temperature Catalytic Reactions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ionic-liquid-efficient-modulator-artificial-enzyme-system-toward-realization-hightemperature-catalyt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230775,"mean":5.9680707818984,"rank":2386491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3840699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230775,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98163,"mean":6.7455466677533,"rank":36603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":61478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98163,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16338,"mean":4.8891406010896,"rank":9478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":6838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16338,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":483,"mean":4.5073900414938,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":483,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
