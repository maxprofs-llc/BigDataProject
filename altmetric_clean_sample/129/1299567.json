It shows intriguing single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation and reversible dehydration\/rehydration phenomenon upon removal and rebinding of the lattice water molecules, which is supported by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, and photoluminescence data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Hao-Ling Sun","Dan-Dan Yin","Qi Chen","Zhenqiang Wang"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic302556r","first_seen_on":"2013-03-13T20:18:13+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1363205836,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic302556r"],"pmid":"23485331","pubdate":"2013-03-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"130313114429005","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Europium Pyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxylate Framework with a Single-Crystal-to-Single-Crystal Transition and a Reversible Dehydration\/Rehydration Process","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/europium-pyrimidine46dicarboxylate-framework-singlecrystalto-singlecrystal-transition-reversible-deh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508238,"mean":5.1674528195662,"rank":3584053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508238,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89222,"mean":6.5488979948667,"rank":72103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89222,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6000,"mean":1.0374452408735,"rank":3008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6000,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":458,"mean":0.64157549234136,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":458,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
