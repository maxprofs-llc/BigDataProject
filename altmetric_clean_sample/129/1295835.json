DNA damage can also alter the fine structure of DNA that may serve as a recognition signal for DNA repair enzymes. A new, advanced sampling replica-exchange method has been developed to specifically enhance the sampling of conformational substates in duplex DNA during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The approach employs specific biasing potentials acting on pairs of pseudodihedral angles of the nucleic acid backbone that are added in the replica simulations to promote transitions of the most common substates of the DNA backbone. The sampled states can exchange with a reference simulation under the control of the original force field. The application to 7,8-dihydro-8oxo-guanosine, one of the most common oxidative damage in DNA indicated better convergence of sampled states during 10 ns simulations compared to 20 times longer standard MD simulations. It is well suited to study systematically the fine structure and dynamics of large nucleic acids under realistic conditions, including explicit solvent and ions. The biasing potential-replica exchange MD simulations indicated significant differences in the population of nucleic acid backbone substates in the case of 7,8-dihydro-8oxo-guanosine compared to a regular guanosine in the same sequence context. This concerns both the ratio of the B-DNA substates B(I) and B(II) associated with the backbone dihedral angles \u03b5 and \u03b6 but also coupled changes in the backbone dihedral angles \u03b1 and \u03b3. Such differences may play a crucial role in the initial recognition of damaged DNA by repair enzymes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","doi":"10.1016\/j.bpj.2013.01.032","first_seen_on":"2013-03-12T10:15:18+00:00","issns":["1542-0086"],"issue":"5","journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1363084217,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23473492?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23473492","pubdate":"2013-03-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Biophysical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Influence of 8-oxoguanosine on the fine structure of DNA studied with biasing-potential replica exchange simulations.","type":"article","volume":"104","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-8oxoguanosine-fine-structure-dna-studied-biasingpotential-replica-exchange-simulations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3548387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89268,"mean":6.4637983577359,"rank":70056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89268,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2060,"mean":2.7173190869354,"rank":1581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2060,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":6.3493636363636,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
