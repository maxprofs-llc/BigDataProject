Migraine, with and without aura (MA and MO), is a prevalent and complex neurovascular disorder that may also be affected by genetically influenced hyperhomocysteinaemia. To determine whether the C677T variant in the MTHFR gene is associated with migraine susceptibility we utilised unrelated and family-based case-control study designs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c7","authors":["Lea RA","Ovcaric M","Sundholm J","MacMillan J","Griffiths LR"],"doi":"10.1186\/1741-7015-2-3","first_seen_on":"2013-03-13T13:09:54+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1741-7015","","17417015"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1407617966,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15053827","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/2\/3"],"pmcid":"PMC375543","pmid":"15053827","pubdate":"2004-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"3","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene variant C677T influences susceptibility to migraine with aura.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase-gene-variant-c677t-influences-susceptibility-migraine-aura"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4842394,"mean":5.7741414812912,"rank":384647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4455830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4842394,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91458,"mean":6.6821360202062,"rank":8859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":82556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91458,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1276,"mean":24.349940392157,"rank":551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1276,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":31.3064,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
