Here, using a pregnane X receptor (PXR)-humanized mouse model, we found that co-treatment with RIF and INH causes accumulation of the endogenous hepatotoxin protoporphyrin IX in the liver through PXR-mediated alteration of the heme biosynthesis pathway. These results provide insight into the mechanism of liver injury induced by co-treatment with these compounds and may lead to their safer use in the clinic.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003166","authors":["Feng Li","Jie Lu","Jie Cheng","Laiyou Wang","Tsutomu Matsubara","Iv\u00c3\u00a1n L Csanaky","Curtis D Klaassen","Frank J Gonzalez","Xiaochao Ma","Li F","Lu J","Cheng J","Wang L","Matsubara T","Csanaky IL","Klaassen CD","Gonzalez FJ","Ma X"],"doi":"10.1038\/nm.3104","endpage":"420","first_seen_on":"2013-03-10T19:55:36+00:00","issns":["1078-8956","1546-170X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Nature Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1376438400,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nm\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nm.3104.html"],"pmid":"23475203","pubdate":"2013-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"418","subjects":["molecularbiology","medicine"],"title":"Human PXR modulates hepatotoxicity associated with rifampicin and isoniazid co-therapy","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-pxr-modulates-hepatotoxicity-associated-rifampicin-isoniazid-cotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":840193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3661004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89368,"mean":6.483631027113,"rank":19131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":70058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89368,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3722,"mean":15.699602794948,"rank":2059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3722,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":29.285596638655,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
