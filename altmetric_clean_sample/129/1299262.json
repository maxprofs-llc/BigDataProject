However, the relationship between impulsivity in decision-making and resting-state brain activity remains unknown. To address this issue, we used functional MRI to record brain activity from human adults during a resting state and during a delay discounting task (DDT) that requires choosing between an immediate smaller reward and a larger delayed reward. In experiment I, we identified four DDT-related brain networks. The money network (the striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, etc.) and the time network (the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, etc.) were associated with the valuation process; the frontoparietal network and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex-anterior insular cortex network were related to the choice process. Moreover, we found that the resting-state functional connectivity of the brain regions in these networks was significantly correlated with participants' discounting rate, a behavioral index of impulsivity during the DDT. In experiment II, we tested an independent group of subjects and demonstrated that this resting-state functional connectivity was able to predict individuals' discounting rates. Together, these findings suggest that resting-state functional organization of the human brain may be a biomarker of impulsivity and can predict economic decision-making behavior.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Nan Li","Ning Ma","Ying Liu","Xiao-Song He","De-Lin Sun","Xian-Ming Fu","Xiaochu Zhang","Shihui Han","Da-Ren Zhang"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.1342-12.2013","first_seen_on":"2013-03-13T17:12:29+00:00","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1390070378,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/11\/4886.abstract","http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/11\/4886.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/11\/4886.full.pdf","pmid":"23486959","pubdate":"2013-03-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"4886","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Resting-State Functional Connectivity Predicts Impulsivity in Economic Decision-Making","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/restingstate-functional-connectivity-predicts-impulsivity-economic-decisionmaking"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8391523,"mean":7.0679857327356,"rank":643367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7745127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8391523,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118839,"mean":6.6974470960468,"rank":9940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":108834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118839,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12556,"mean":10.146715093588,"rank":1788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":10761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12556,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":9.1564974619289,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":48,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
