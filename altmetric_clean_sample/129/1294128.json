Btk is overexpressed and constitutively active in several B-lineage lymphoid malignancies. Btk has emerged as a new antiapoptotic molecular target for treatment of B-lineage leukemias and lymphomas. Preclinical and early clinical results indicate that Btk inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bca2","authors":["Faith Uckun","D'Cruz"],"doi":"10.2147\/ott.s33732","first_seen_on":"2013-03-11T16:21:30+00:00","issns":["1178-6930"],"journal":"OncoTargets and therapy","last_mentioned_on":1363895383,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/novel-bruton39s-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-currently-in-development-peer-reviewed-article-OTT-recommendation1"],"pmid":"23493945","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Medical Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"161","title":"Novel Bruton&#39;s tyrosine kinase inhibitors currently in development","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-brutons-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-currently-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228821,"mean":5.9651376482241,"rank":2736808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3326763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228821,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98160,"mean":6.7439790951416,"rank":44396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":50489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98160,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":762,"mean":1.26876478318,"rank":172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":762,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.1166666666667,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Ph.
