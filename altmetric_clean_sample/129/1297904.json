The ABC subtype of DLBCL is associated with constitutive activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway, and oncogenic lesions have been identified in its regulators, including CARD11\/CARMA1 (caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11), A20\/TNFAIP3, and CD79A\/B. In this study, we offer evidence of therapeutic potential for the selective PKC (protein kinase C) inhibitor sotrastaurin (STN) in preclinical models of DLBCL. A significant fraction of ABC DLBCL cell lines exhibited strong sensitivity to STN, and we found that the molecular nature of NF-\u03baB pathway lesions predicted responsiveness. CD79A\/B mutations correlated with STN sensitivity, whereas CARD11 mutations rendered ABC DLBCL cell lines insensitive. Growth inhibitory effects of PKC inhibition correlated with NF-\u03baB pathway inhibition and were mediated by induction of G\u2081-phase cell-cycle arrest and\/or cell death. We found that STN produced significant antitumor effects in a mouse xenograft model of CD79A\/B-mutated DLBCL. Collectively, our findings offer a strong rationale for the clinical evaluation of STN in ABC DLBCL patients who harbor CD79 mutations also illustrating the necessity to stratify DLBCL patients according to their genetic abnormalities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Tara L.
