This apparent paradox raises questions regarding the possible sources of a subjective experience of action. In addition, it poses a yet unresolved diagnostic challenge, namely how to describe or even quantify this experience in a scientifically and clinically useful way. Here, we describe recent experimental approaches that have shed light on the phenomenology of action in FMD. We first outline the sources and content of a subjective experience of action in healthy humans and discuss how this experience may be created in the brain. Turning to FMD, we describe implicit, behavioral measures that have revealed specific abnormalities in the awareness of action in FMD. Based on these abnormalities, we propose a potential, new solution to the paradox of volition in FMD.","aggregated_in":[18479432],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cfad","authors":["Stenner, M-P","Haggard, P","Stenner, M.-P.","Haggard, P."],"book":{"isbns":["9780128017722"],"uri":"https:\/\/www.elsevier.com\/books\/functional-neurologic-disorders\/hallett\/978-0-12-801772-2","title":"Functional Neurologic Disorders, Volume 139"},"doi":"10.1016\/b978-0-12-801772-2.00011-4","first_seen_on":"2016-10-18T09:41:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0072-9752","00729752"],"journal":"Handbook of clinical neurology","last_mentioned_on":1490362868,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27719833","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27719833?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27719833","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Functional Neurologic Disorders","type":"chapter","volume":"139","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/voluntary-involuntary-neurophysiologic-approach-functional-movement-disorders-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":3438175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4911435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249639,"mean":12.778424686946,"rank":95836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":151932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249639,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":578,"mean":1.8950329289428,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":578,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WTCN_UCL\/statuses\/788314041680887809","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12702090,18479432],"posted_on":"2016-10-18T09:41:28+00:00","author":{"name":"WTCN_UCL","url":"http:\/\/www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/737621230610571264\/XOXCBNkK_normal.jpg","description":"The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging (WTCN) at @ucl is an interdisciplinary centre for neuroimaging excellence.","id_on_source":"WTCN_UCL","tweeter_id":"1127676926","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":1754},"tweet_id":"788314041680887809"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PhilCorlett1\/statuses\/788327936805986304","license":"gnip","rt":["WTCN_UCL"],"citation_ids":[12702090,18479432],"posted_on":"2016-10-18T10:36:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Phil Corlett","url":"http:\/\/medicine.yale.edu\/lab\/corlett\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/494831518838034433\/sVZs2LcB_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"PhilCorlett1","tweeter_id":"486643079","geo":{"lt":41.30815,"ln":-72.92816,"country":"US"},"followers":1106},"tweet_id":"788327936805986304"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/845269250273001472","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12702090,18479432],"posted_on":"2017-03-24T13:41:08+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
