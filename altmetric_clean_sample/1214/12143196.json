Structural characterization suggests that framework 1 possesses one-dimensional channels with potential pore volume, and the large channels in the framework can capture CO2. Interestingly, investigations on the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and epoxides reveal that compound 1 can be considered as an efficient catalyst for CO2 fixation with epoxides under 1 atm pressure. Importantly, 1 can be reused at least five times without any obvious loss in catalytic activity. Furthermore, the luminescent explorations of 1 reveal that 1 can act as a recyclable sensor of Al(3+), and the corresponding detection limit can reach 5 \u00d7 10(-8) M (1.35 ppb), which is obviously lower than the United States Environmental Protection Agency's recommended level of Al(3+) in drinking water (200 ppb). These results show that 1 has a level of sensitivity higher than that of other reported MOF-based sensors of Al(3+).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Hang Xu"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b01407","first_seen_on":"2016-09-22T19:52:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1474579904,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b01407"],"pmid":"27672698","pubdate":"2016-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              A Bifunctional Europium\u2013Organic Framework with Chemical Fixation of CO\n              2\n              and Luminescent Detection of Al\n              3+\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bifunctional-europiumorganic-framework-chemical-fixation-co2-luminescent-detection-al3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":6388565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1143293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253723,"mean":12.666743522437,"rank":178358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":44353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253723,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9294,"mean":1.1431300979232,"rank":3979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":4013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9294,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":369,"mean":0.98152173913043,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":369,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
