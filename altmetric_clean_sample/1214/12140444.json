Conversely, it is also widely held that salt-sensitive individuals develop salt-induced hypertension because of an impaired renal capacity to excrete salt that causes greater salt retention and blood volume expansion than that which occurs in normal salt-resistant individuals. Here we review results of both acute and chronic salt-loading studies that have compared salt-induced changes in sodium retention and blood volume between normal subjects (salt-resistant normotensive control subjects) and salt-sensitive subjects. The results of properly controlled studies strongly support an alternative view: during acute or chronic increases in salt intake, normal salt-resistant subjects undergo substantial salt retention and do not excrete salt more rapidly, retain less sodium, or undergo lesser blood volume expansion than do salt-sensitive subjects. These observations: (i) directly conflict with the widely held view that renal excretion of sodium accounts for resistance to salt-induced hypertension, and (ii) have implications for contemporary understanding of how various genetic, immunologic, and other factors determine acute and chronic blood pressure responses to high salt diets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fb9","authors":["Kurtz, Theodore W","DiCarlo, Stephen E","Pravenec, Michal","Schmidlin, Olga","Tanaka, Masae","Morris, R Curtis"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.kint.2016.05.032","first_seen_on":"2016-09-22T17:01:49+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1523-1755"],"journal":"Kidney International","last_mentioned_on":1474677011,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27546606?utm_content=buffer5dfc2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27546606?utm_content=buffer75ce4&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27546606?utm_content=buffercb7b6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"27546606","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"An alternative hypothesis to the widely held view that renal excretion of sodium accounts for resistance to salt-induced hypertension.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alternative-hypothesis-widely-held-view-renal-excretion-sodium-accounts-resistance-saltinduced-hyper"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":1933263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6476731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253827,"mean":12.664768628903,"rank":77119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":176007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253827,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2624,"mean":4.2904277544796,"rank":681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2624,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":13.883793103448,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
