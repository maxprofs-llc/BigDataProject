Likewise, T-cell signals may be involved in regulating effectors of epithelial innate defense.\n\u2003Whole blood of 43 persistent and 49 non-carriers was stimulated with viable S. aureus Th1\/Th2\/Th17 cytokine expression was measured, compared between carrier groups, and linked with data on human beta-defensin-3 (hBD-3) mRNA in skin while adjusting for transcriptionally relevant promotor haplotypes.\n\u2003Compared to carriers, stimulated whole blood of non-carriers contained on average 60% more IFN-\u03b3 mRNA (P=0.031) and 19% less IL-17 mRNA (P=0.11), resulting in an on average 90% higher IFN-\u03b3\/IL-17A mRNA ratio (P=0.003). In a multivariable model, per duplication of mRNA template, the risk of being a carrier increased by 93% for IL-17A (OR 1.93, 95% confidence interval 1.10-3.41, P=0.023) and decreased by 35% for IFN-\u03b3 (0.65, 0.47-0.91, P=0.01). Independent of carriage and DEFB promotor haplotype, one unit increase in IFN-\u03b3\/IL17A mRNA ratio (mean 5.93; SD 1.60) led to a 24% increase in hBD-3 transcription in experimentally wounded human skin (P=0.003).\n\u2003A low Th1\/Th17 mRNA ratio increases the propensity for persistent S. aureus nasal colonization, with downregulated hBD-3 transcription providing a potential link.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Nurjadi, Dennis","Kain, Marlon","Marcinek, Patrick","Gaile, Marika","Heeg, Klaus","Zanger, Philipp"],"doi":"10.1093\/infdis\/jiw440","first_seen_on":"2016-09-22T18:25:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1537-6613","0022-1899"],"journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1474568710,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27651414?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27651414","pubdate":"2016-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"jiw440","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"\n              The ratio of Th1 to Th17 cytokines in whole blood is associated with human \u03b2-defensin-3 expression in skin and persistent\n              Staphylococcus aureus\n              nasal carriage\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ratio-thelper-type-1-th1-th17-cytokines-whole-blood-associated-human-%CE%B2defensin-3-expression-skin-per"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":7275618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253723,"mean":12.666803036394,"rank":209375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253723,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6949,"mean":6.6062864133564,"rank":6470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6949,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":12.213479674797,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/779023753074270208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12141821],"posted_on":"2016-09-22T18:25:10+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
