In endemic areas, RHD has long been a target of screening programmes that, historically, have relied on cardiac auscultation. The evolution of portable echocardiographic equipment has changed the face of screening for RHD over the past 5 years, with greatly improved sensitivity. However, concerns have been raised about the specificity of echocardiography, and the interpretation of minor abnormalities poses new challenges. The natural history of RHD in children with subclinical abnormalities detected by echocardiographic screening remains unknown, and long-term follow-up studies are needed to evaluate the significance of detecting these changes at an early stage. For a disease to be deemed suitable for screening from a public health perspective, it needs to fulfil a number of criteria. RHD meets some, but not all, of these criteria. If screening programmes are to identify additional cases of RHD, parallel improvements in the systems that deliver secondary prophylaxis are essential.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004270","authors":["Kathryn Roberts","Samantha Colquhoun","Andrew Steer","Bo Rem|[eacute]|nyi","Jonathan Carapetis","Roberts K","Colquhoun S","Steer A","Rem\u00e9nyi B","Carapetis J","Bo Rem\u00e9nyi"],"doi":"10.1038\/nrcardio.2012.157","endpage":"58","first_seen_on":"2012-11-20T20:25:08+00:00","issns":["1759-5002","1759-5010"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nature Reviews Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1356009690,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrcardio\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nrcardio.2012.157.html"],"pmid":"23149830","pubdate":"2012-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"49","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Screening for rheumatic heart disease: current approaches and controversies","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nrcardio.2012.157","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/screening-rheumatic-heart-disease-current-approaches-controversies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632209,"mean":4.9245852853192,"rank":1806801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1648216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632209,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275080,"mean":5.6453025639909,"rank":124729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":131684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275080,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":500,"mean":4.2126172344689,"rank":270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":500,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.5184,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":8}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrcardio\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nrcardio.2012.157.html","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=169646399847020&id=232176403487389","citation_ids":[1079766],"posted_on":"2012-11-19T23:42:15+00:00","summary":"Screening for rheumatic heart disease: current approaches and controversies. http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrcardio\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nrcardio.2012.157.html","author":{"name":"NCDChild","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/232176403487389","facebook_wall_name":"NCDChild","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/232176403487389\/picture","id_on_source":"232176403487389"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kidsheart2013\/statuses\/281751179841658881","license":"public","citation_ids":[1079766],"posted_on":"2012-12-20T13:21:30+00:00","author":{"name":"kidsheartSA","url":"http:\/\/www.pcssa.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/527826448371810304\/m7yZ3HfM_normal.jpeg","description":"Official Twitter feed of the Paediatric Society of South Africa-our mission is to improve the quality of care for all children with heart disease.","id_on_source":"kidsheart2013","tweeter_id":"554484723","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":938},"tweet_id":"281751179841658881"}]}}
