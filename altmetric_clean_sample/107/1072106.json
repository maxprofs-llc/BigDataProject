In the food industry the financial incentive to substituting the true name of a food product with a higher value alternative is driving food fraud. This applies to British pork products where products derived from traditional pig breeds are of premium value. The objective of this study was to develop a genetic assay for regulatory authentication of traditional pig breed-labelled products in the porcine food industry in the United Kingdom.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Samantha Wilkinson","Alan Archibald","Chris Haley","Hendrik-Jan Megens","Richard Crooijmans","Martien Groenen","Pamela Wiener","Rob Ogden","Wilkinson S","Archibald AL","Haley CS","Megens HJ","Crooijmans RP","Groenen MA","Wiener P","Ogden R","Alan L Archibald","Chris S Haley","Richard PMA Crooijmans","Martien AM Groenen"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-13-580","first_seen_on":"2012-11-16T09:03:57+00:00","funders":["mrc","bbsrc"],"issns":["","1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1354555560,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/13\/580","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2164-13-580"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcgenomics\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-13-580.pdf","pmid":"23150935","pubdate":"2012-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"580","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Development of a genetic tool for product regulation in the diverse British pig breed market","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2164-13-580","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-genetic-tool-product-regulation-diverse-british-pig-breed-market"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.416,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.416},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8073833,"mean":6.8527509039018,"rank":562790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7507730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8073833,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95280,"mean":5.9844158523915,"rank":6997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":88281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95280,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5745,"mean":4.1723676880223,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":5449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5745,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179,"mean":3.2248764044944,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
