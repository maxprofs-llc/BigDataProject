Although policy change is often viewed as incremental change toward more progressive policies, the two countries studied here reflect opposing dynamics. The Netherlands moved from being a pioneering country to one that gradually marginalized the policy issue, whereas Spain, in contrast, recently developed innovative and far-reaching policies after a long period of low to moderate state responses. The case study points to the central role of frame negotiation, left-wing governments, and strong feminist mobilization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f8","authors":["Roggeband C"],"doi":"10.1177\/1077801212455359","endpage":"806","first_seen_on":"2012-11-20T14:30:16+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1077-8012","1552-8448"],"issue":"7","journal":"Violence Against Women","last_mentioned_on":1353956539,"links":["http:\/\/vaw.sagepub.com\/content\/18\/7\/784\/suppl\/DC1"],"pmid":"22946107","pubdate":"2012-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Law And Legal Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"startpage":"784","title":"Shifting policy responses to domestic violence in the Netherlands and Spain (1980-2009).","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shifting-policy-responses-domestic-violence-netherlands-spain-19802009"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4725029,"mean":5.6965106471347,"rank":2512094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1568977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4725029,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280476,"mean":6.0642974026207,"rank":138449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":109916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280476,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":4.291718969555,"rank":279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":4.0775,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
