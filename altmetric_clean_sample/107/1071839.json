Here, we report the development of a mouse model of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis, which recapitulates key events in its formation and clinical course. Specifically, using the conditional K14cre;Cdh1(F\/F);Trp53(F\/F) model of de novo mammary tumor formation, we orthotopically transplanted invasive lobular carcinoma (mILC) fragments into mammary glands of wild-type syngeneic hosts. Once primary tumors were established in recipient mice, we mimicked the clinical course of treatment by conducting a mastectomy. After surgery, recipient mice succumbed to widespread overt metastatic disease in lymph nodes, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Genomic profiling of paired mammary tumors and distant metastases showed that our model provides a unique tool to further explore the biology of metastatic disease. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant intervention studies using standard-of-care chemotherapeutics showed the value of this model in determining therapeutic agents that can target early- and late-stage metastatic disease. In obtaining a more accurate preclinical model of metastatic lobular breast cancer, our work offers advances supporting the development of more effective treatment strategies for metastatic disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Karin E. de Visser"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-11-4208","first_seen_on":"2012-11-16T03:57:04+00:00","issns":["1538-7445"],"journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1354045810,"links":["http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/11\/14\/0008-5472.CAN-11-4208.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/11\/14\/0008-5472.CAN-11-4208.full.pdf","pmid":"23151903","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"A preclinical mouse model of invasive lobular breast cancer metastasis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preclinical-mouse-model-invasive-lobular-breast-cancer-metastasis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1989397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73011,"mean":5.6423355156828,"rank":28584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":42216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73011,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5724,"mean":3.9665560020968,"rank":2867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5724,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":3.6966666666667,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
