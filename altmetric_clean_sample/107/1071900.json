This study aimed to assess the proportions of inter-ethnic admixture in the Brazilian population of Rio de Janeiro using autosomal Ancestry-Informative Markers (AIMs). The autosomal data were also compared to the results expected from uniparental genetic markers. A total of 413 individuals were genotyped for 46 AIM-Indels and ancestry estimates were then assessed using HGDP-CEPH samples as ancestral reference. Individuals from Rio de Janeiro presented highly diverse admixture patterns. The global admixture estimates showed a predominantly European ancestry, above 55%, followed by African and Amerindian contributions. A separate self-declared Afro-descendant group also included in this study revealed an increased African ancestry, from \u223c30% to \u223c50%. The inter-ethnic admixture landscape of Rio de Janeiro captured by autosomal AIM-Indels is in agreement with historical records and similar to that expected from uniparental mtDNA and Y-chromosome information. The AIM-Indel panel proved to be a rapid strategy to estimate autosomal genetic ancestry at individual and population levels in Rio de Janeiro, which is useful in population genetics and in case-control association studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"55c8b9422a83ee4e4d8b4567","authors":["Fernanda Saloum Neves Manta","Rui Pereira","Alexandre Caiafa","Dayse Aparecida Silva","Leonor Gusm\u00e3o","Elizeu Fagundes Carvalho"],"doi":"10.3109\/03014460.2012.742138","first_seen_on":"2012-11-16T04:44:55+00:00","issns":["0301-4460","1464-5033"],"journal":"Annals of Human Biology","last_mentioned_on":1353041087,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/03014460.2012.742138","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/03014460.2012.742138?ai=1lh0&mi=3lufaq&af=R&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed&"],"pmid":"23151124","pubdate":"2012-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"121115021453005","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Analysis of genetic ancestry in the admixed Brazilian population from Rio de Janeiro using 46 autosomal ancestry-informative indel markers.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-genetic-ancestry-admixed-brazilian-population-rio-janeiro-using-46-autosomal-ancestryinform"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2311597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1576814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73008,"mean":5.5992893832098,"rank":35484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":27373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73008,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":4.4808834951456,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.5935,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
