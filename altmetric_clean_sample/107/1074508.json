A recent study of patients presenting for transurethral surgery suggested that the addition of a small amount of lidocaine to intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine could shorten the duration of the sensory and motor blocks. In this prospective, randomized double-blind study we investigated these findings in patients undergoing unilateral knee arthroscopy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000571e","authors":["Susanne Kledal"],"doi":"10.1213\/ane.0b013e31822d676f","first_seen_on":"2012-11-17T15:45:03+00:00","issns":["1526-7598"],"journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","last_mentioned_on":1352244598,"links":["http:\/\/www.anesthesia-analgesia.org\/content\/113\/5\/1272.full.pdf+html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.anesthesia-analgesia.org\/content\/113\/5\/1272.full.pdf","pmid":"21918168","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"The Addition of Lidocaine to Bupivacaine Does Not Shorten the Duration of Spinal Anesthesia: A Randomized, Double-Blinded Study of Patients Undergoing Knee Arthroscopy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/addition-lidocaine-bupivacaine-not-shorten-duration-spinal-anesthesia-randomized-doubleblinded-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":2900963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275554,"mean":5.6165653794372,"rank":218990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275554,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2353,"mean":2.6939268707483,"rank":1821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2353,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":2.1897590361446,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
