Searching for alternative natural antioxidants is considered important strategy to manage diabetes. This study evaluated the effect of Riceberry bran oil (RBBO) supplementation on oxidative stress and organ histology in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats fed a high fat (HF) diet. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats with hyperglycemia were divided into four groups: DM group fed a HF diet alone; DMRL group fed a HF diet and 5% RBBO; DMRM group fed a HF diet and 7.5% RBBO; DMRH group fed a HF diet and 15% RBBO. Normal rats were used as normal control and were divided into NC and NR group fed a normal diet containing either 5% corn oil or 5% RBBO, respectively. After 12 weeks, RBBO significantly decreased malondialdehyde and restored superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, coenzyme Q(10) and ORAC levels in diabetic rats. RBBO additionally improved the regenerative changes of the pancreas, kidneys, heart and liver. These findings indicate that pigmented RBBO could provide beneficial effect on diabetes by decreasing oxidative stress and recovering organ histology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Juthathip Posuwan","Pattaneeya Prangthip","Vijittra Leardkamolkarn","Uruwan Yamborisut","Ruethaithip Surasiang","Rin Charoensiri","Ratchanee Kongkachuichai"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2012.09.144","first_seen_on":"2012-11-18T03:51:52+00:00","issns":["03088146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1353210701,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0308814612016366"],"pmid":"23265517","pubdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Long-term supplementation of high pigmented rice bran oil (Oryza sativa L.) on amelioration of oxidative stress and histological changes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats fed a high fat diet; Riceberry bran oil","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-supplementation-high-pigmented-rice-bran-oil-oryza-sativa-l-amelioration-oxidative-stress-h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2938844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1425736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279632,"mean":5.8454271522114,"rank":180566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":88444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279632,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2105,"mean":2.7907176806084,"rank":1191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2105,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":12.89944,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
