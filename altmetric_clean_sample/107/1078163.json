Research on the underlying causes to the contrasting effects of occupational and leisure time physical activity on cardiovascular health is lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the relation of objective and self-report measures of occupational and leisure time physical activity with 24-h ambulatory systolic blood pressure (BP).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Els Clays","Dirk De Bacquer","Koen Van Herck","Guy De Backer","France Kittel","Andreas Holtermann","Clays E","De Bacquer D","Van Herck K","De Backer G","Kittel F","Holtermann A"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2458-12-1002","first_seen_on":"2012-11-20T06:26:03+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-3123760","handles":["1854\/LU-3123760"],"issns":["","1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1354638642,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/12\/1002\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2458-12-1002"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1471-2458-12-1002?site=bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"23164344","pubdate":"2012-11-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biostatistics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vaccine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1002","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Occupational and leisure time physical activity in contrasting relation to ambulatory blood pressure","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/occupational-leisure-time-physical-activity-contrasting-relation-ambulatory-blood-pressure-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.562,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.562},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":416112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4620907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282938,"mean":6.1086871989169,"rank":27718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":255218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282938,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5516,"mean":6.5565504986401,"rank":652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":4864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5516,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":349,"mean":6.1389022988506,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":349,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
