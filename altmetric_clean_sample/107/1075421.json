For the study of the genetic, biochemical, and neuronal basis of behavior, C. elegans is an ideal organism because it is genetically tractable, amenable to microscopy, and shows a number of complex behaviors, including taxis, learning, and social interaction. Behavioral analysis based on tracking the movements of worms as they crawl on agar plates have been particularly useful in the study of sensory behavior, locomotion, and general mutational phenotyping. Our system works by moving the camera and illumination system as the worms crawls on a stationary agar plate, which ensures no mechanical stimulus is transmitted to the worm. Our tracking system is easy to use and includes a semi-automatic calibration feature. A challenge of all video tracking systems is that it generates an enormous amount of data that is intrinsically high dimensional. Our image processing and data analysis programs deal with this challenge by reducing the worms shape into a set of independent components, which comprehensively reconstruct the worms behavior as a function of only 3-4 dimensions. As an example of the process we show that the worm enters and exits its reversal state in a phase specific manner.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","doi":"10.3791\/4094","first_seen_on":"2012-11-18T15:41:31+00:00","issns":["1940-087X"],"journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1393537105,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/4094\/c-elegans-tracking-and-behavioral-measurement","http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/4094?utm_source=youtube"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/4094","pmid":"23183548","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JoVE","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"C. elegans Tracking and Behavioral Measurement","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/c-elegans-tracking-behavioral-measurement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230503,"mean":5.96748679288,"rank":1175452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5046800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230503,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263841,"mean":6.5660385157674,"rank":60440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":202873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263841,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3675,"mean":3.0166526946108,"rank":554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3675,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":499,"mean":4.1010441767068,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":499,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
