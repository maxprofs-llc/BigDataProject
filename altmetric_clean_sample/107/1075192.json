Different SPE sorbents were evaluated, including lab-made fluorinated and phenyl and commercial Oasis HLB and C18, with the commercial phases being more suitable for the target compounds. Recoveries in the range of 70-120% were obtained for all target compounds, with the exception for paracetamol (acetaminophen), and precision values (inter-day and intra-day), expressed in terms of relative standard deviations (RSD), lower than 20% were obtained for all target compounds. Quantification limits were in the range of 0.006-0.208 \u03bcg L(-1) and the methods developed were successfully applied for the analysis of drinking water samples, detecting some pharmaceuticals and pesticides, but at concentration levels lower than the MRL.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003609","authors":["Maldaner L","Jardim IC"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.talanta.2012.08.006","first_seen_on":"2012-11-18T08:39:32+00:00","issns":["0039-9140","00399140"],"journal":"Talanta","last_mentioned_on":1353231025,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0039914012006947"],"pmid":"23141309","pubdate":"2012-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Determination of some organic contaminants in water samples by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry ","type":"article","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determination-some-organic-contaminants-water-samples-solidphase-extraction-liquid-chromatographytan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1989410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279635,"mean":5.8569422459357,"rank":112889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":157856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279635,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1012,"mean":1.3091275964392,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1012,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":1.2137931034483,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
