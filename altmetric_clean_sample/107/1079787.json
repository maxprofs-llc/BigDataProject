Up to this date, the association of patient's personality with adherence with a mandibular advancement device (MAD) has not been studied. The purposes of this study were to examine the association between type D personality and poor adherence to MAD treatment and to examine the impact of type D personality on perceived side effects during this treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000894b","authors":["M.
