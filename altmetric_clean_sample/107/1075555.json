Science.alltop","#Metformin Reduces Hepatic Expression of #SIRT3"],"citation":{"abstract":"Metformin inhibits ATP production in mitochondria and this may be involved in the anti-hyperglycemic effects of the drug. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is a mitochondrial protein deacetylase that regulates the function of the electron transport chain and maintains basal ATP yield. We hypothesized that metformin treatment could diminish mitochondrial ATP production through downregulation of SIRT3 expression. Glucagon and cAMP induced SIRT3 mRNA in mouse primary hepatocytes. Metformin prevented SIRT3 induction by glucagon. Moreover, metformin downregulated constitutive expression of SIRT3 in primary hepatocytes and in the liver in vivo. Estrogen related receptor alpha (ERR\u03b1) mediates regulation of Sirt3 gene by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1). ERR\u03b1 mRNA expression was regulated in a similar manner as SIRT3 mRNA by glucagon, cAMP and metformin. However, a higher metformin concentration was required for downregulation of ERR\u03b1 than SIRT3. ERR\u03b1 siRNA attenuated PGC-1\u03b1 mediated induction of SIRT3, but did not affect constitutive expression. Overexpression of the constitutively active form of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) induced SIRT3 mRNA, indicating that the SIRT3 downregulation by metformin is not mediated by AMPK. Metformin reduced the hepatocyte ATP level. This effect was partially counteracted by SIRT3 overexpression. Furthermore, metformin decreased mitochondrial SIRT3 protein levels and this was associated with enhanced acetylation of several mitochondrial proteins. However, metformin increased mitochondrial mass in hepatocytes. Altogether, our results indicate that metformin attenuates mitochondrial expression of SIRT3 and suggest that this mechanism is involved in regulation of energy metabolism by metformin in the liver and may contribute to the therapeutic action of metformin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Marcin Buler","Sanna-Mari Aatsinki","Valerio Izzi","Jukka Hakkola"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0049863","first_seen_on":"2012-11-18T17:46:50+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1382998359,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.plos.org\/~r\/plosone\/PLoSONE\/~3\/isng3LQUJSY\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0049863","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0049863"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0049863.pdf","pmid":"23166782","pubdate":"2012-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e49863","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Metformin Reduces Hepatic Expression of SIRT3, the Mitochondrial Deacetylase Controlling Energy Metabolism","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metformin-reduces-hepatic-expression-sirt3-mitochondrial-deacetylase-controlling-energy-metabolism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8350816,"mean":7.043663844779,"rank":3278919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5060237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8350816,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293890,"mean":6.7968162061186,"rank":94166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":199235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293890,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115380,"mean":10.626246457328,"rank":41461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":73728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115380,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6360,"mean":7.6583318131782,"rank":1878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":4470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6360,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
