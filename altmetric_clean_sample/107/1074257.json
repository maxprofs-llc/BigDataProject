Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) secrete Wnt ligands that activate Wnt signaling in multiple myeloma. The canonical Wnt pathway which is mediated through the transcriptional effector \u03b2-catenin (\u03b2-cat) is commonly de-regulated in many cancers. Cells with active \u03b2-cat-regulated transcription (CRT) are protected against apoptosis; conversely, inhibition of CRT may prevent cell proliferation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["Narayanan BA","Doudican NA","Park J","Xu D","Narayanan NK","Dasgupta R","Mazumder A"],"first_seen_on":"2012-11-17T11:48:44+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1791-7530","0250-7005"],"issue":"11","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1353448212,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23155232?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23155232","pubdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Antagonistic Effect of Small-molecule Inhibitors of Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin in Multiple Myeloma.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antagonistic-effect-smallmolecule-inhibitors-wnt%CE%B2catenin-multiple-myeloma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2925787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1433952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279737,"mean":5.8479068621843,"rank":176293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":91362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279737,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1276,"mean":2.4653317647059,"rank":575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1276,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":14.883421052632,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/269768991990480896","license":"public","citation_ids":[1074257],"posted_on":"2012-11-17T11:48:34+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"269768991990480896"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Myeloma_Doc\/statuses\/271007560029573120","license":"public","citation_ids":[1074257],"posted_on":"2012-11-20T21:50:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Robert Z.
