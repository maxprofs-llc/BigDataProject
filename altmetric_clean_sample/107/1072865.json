Samples were extracted by in-cell clean-up pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) that allows high extraction efficiency with moderate consumption of organic solvents. The extracts were analyzed by comprehensive gas chromatography and detected with a nitrogen chemiluminiscence detector (GC\u00d7GC-NCD) that provided enhanced selectivity and sensitivity for organic nitrogen containing compounds. Method validation showed good linearity, repeatability and reproducibility (%RSD<8%). Recovery was higher than 80% for most target compounds and limits of detection lower than 16 ng g(-1). The method was used for the determination of the nitrosamine target compounds in house dust samples from both smoking and non-smoking households. All the analytes were found in the samples, nicotine being the most abundant compound in smokers' dust and one of the most abundant in non-smokers' dust. To our knowledge this is the first time that volatile N-nitrosamines and TSNAs have been determined in indoor dust samples. The results demonstrate the presence of these highly carcinogenic compounds in house dust, with inherent human exposure through inhalation and\/or involuntary ingestion of house dust.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["Ram\u00edrez N","Ozel MZ","Lewis AC","Marc\u00e9 RM","Borrull F","Hamilton JF"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chroma.2011.11.017","first_seen_on":"2012-11-16T15:35:24+00:00","issns":["0021-9673","00219673"],"journal":"Journal of Chromatography A","last_mentioned_on":1353080163,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021967311016840"],"pmid":"22153283","pubdate":"2011-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Determination of nicotine and N-nitrosamines in house dust by pressurized liquid extraction and comprehensive gas chromatography\u2014Nitrogen chemiluminiscence detection ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determination-nicotine-nnitrosamines-house-dust-pressurized-liquid-extraction-comprehensive-gas-chro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2086781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2384648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73009,"mean":5.6034978358536,"rank":30609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":41522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73009,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1980,"mean":1.5541485598787,"rank":492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1980,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":0.96268656716418,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
