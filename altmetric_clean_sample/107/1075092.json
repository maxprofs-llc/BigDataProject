We focused on green tea leaves as potential alternatives to AGPs because they contain significant amounts of polyphenol catechins, which have antivirus and antimicrobial effects. We examined cross-resistance between epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is the most abundant catechin of green tea leaves, and commercially available antimicrobials in clinically problematic antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, and whether bacteria have the ability to acquire resistance by consecutive passage in sub-inhibitory concentrations of EGCG. EGCG did not display any cross-resistance with reference antimicrobials and the bacteria did not acquire EGCG resistance. Further, we examined the growth-promoting effects of dried green tea leaves on the breeding of a new Japanese breed, Tokyo-X pigs. While the mortality rates of the green tea leaf (GTL) and AGP groups were both 11.1% (one in nine piglets), the mortality rate was 50% for the control group with an additive-free diet (four in eight piglets). The rate of body weight increase in both the GTL and AGP groups was approximately the same. The growth-promoting effects of green tea leaves and AGPs were similar, and there was no possibility that the antimicrobial properties of catechins caused the same problem as AGPs. Thus, it can be concluded that green tea leaves are a safe feed additive alternative to AGPs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc98","authors":["Ohno A","Kataoka S","Ishii Y","Terasaki T","Kiso M","Okubo M","Yamaguchi K","Tateda K"],"first_seen_on":"2012-11-18T04:17:52+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Microbes and environments","last_mentioned_on":1353212289,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23138151"],"pmid":"23138151","pubdate":"2012-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Evaluation of Camellia sinensis Catechins as a Swine Antimicrobial Feed Additive that does not Cause Antibiotic Resistance.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-camellia-sinensis-catechins-swine-antimicrobial-feed-additive-not-cause-antibiotic-resist"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2938076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1426124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279632,"mean":5.8465524780873,"rank":180328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":88546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279632,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":1.4024096385542,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.2611111111111,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":10,"Unspecified":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ProfDrAndro\/statuses\/270017915061936129","license":"public","citation_ids":[1075092],"posted_on":"2012-11-18T04:17:42+00:00","author":{"name":"SuppVersity News","url":"http:\/\/suppversity.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/685034507465003008\/pNk-Zxdy_normal.jpg","description":"Health, Exercise & Nutrition Science @ http:\/\/suppversity.com","id_on_source":"ProfDrAndro","tweeter_id":"176759548","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2497},"tweet_id":"270017915061936129"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ProfDrAndro\/statuses\/270018030308827136","license":"public","citation_ids":[1075092],"posted_on":"2012-11-18T04:18:09+00:00","author":{"name":"SuppVersity News","url":"http:\/\/suppversity.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/685034507465003008\/pNk-Zxdy_normal.jpg","description":"Health, Exercise & Nutrition Science @ http:\/\/suppversity.com","id_on_source":"ProfDrAndro","tweeter_id":"176759548","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2497},"tweet_id":"270018030308827136"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Evaluation of Camellia sinensis Catechins as a Swine Antimicrobial Feed Additive that does not Cause","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=497837220250720&id=221736504525174","citation_ids":[1075092],"posted_on":"2012-11-18T04:17:39+00:00","summary":"Green tea extracts could be used as antimicrobial growth promoters in swine.\n\nStudy shows, farmers would get all the benefits without the downsides of antibiotics (the rise of resistant bacteria) by simply adding green tea extracts (EGCG) to the chow of th","author":{"name":"SuppVersity","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/221736504525174","facebook_wall_name":"SuppVersity","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/221736504525174\/picture","id_on_source":"221736504525174"}}]}}
