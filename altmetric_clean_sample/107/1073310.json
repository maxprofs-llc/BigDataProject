We identified LRRK2 as a critical regulator\u00a0of EndophilinA. Using genetic and biochemical studies involving Lrrk loss-of-function mutants and Parkinson-related LRRK2(G2019S) gain-of-kinase function, we show that LRRK2 affects synaptic endocytosis by phosphorylating EndoA at S75, a residue in the BAR domain. We show that LRRK2-mediated EndoA phosphorylation has profound effects on EndoA-dependent membrane tubulation and membrane association in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo and on synaptic vesicle endocytosis at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions in\u00a0vivo. Our work uncovers a regulatory mechanism that indicates that reduced LRRK2 kinase activity facilitates EndoA membrane association, while increased kinase activity inhibits membrane association. Consequently, both too much and too little LRRK2-dependent EndoA phosphorylation impedes synaptic endocytosis, and we propose a model in which LRRK2 kinase activity is part of an EndoA phosphorylation cycle that facilitates efficient vesicle formation at synapses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Samer Matta","Kristof Van\u00a0Kolen","Raquel da\u00a0Cunha","Geert van\u00a0den\u00a0Bogaart","Wim Mandemakers","Katarzyna Miskiewicz","Pieter-Jan De\u00a0Bock","Vanessa\u00a0A.
