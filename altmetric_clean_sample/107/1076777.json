With funding from the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, a pan-Canadian steering committee was established with representation from eight provinces to develop symptom protocols using a rigorous methodology (CAN-IMPLEMENT\u00a9). Each protocol is based on a systematic review of the literature to identify relevant clinical practice guidelines. Protocols were validated by cancer nurses from across Canada. The aim of this study is to build an effective and sustainable approach for implementing evidence-informed protocols for nurses to use when providing remote symptom assessment, triage, and guidance in self-management for patients experiencing symptoms while undergoing cancer treatments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000834","doi":"10.1186\/1748-5908-7-110","first_seen_on":"2012-11-19T15:16:03+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Implementation Science","last_mentioned_on":1353433245,"links":["http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/7\/1\/110\/abstract"],"pmid":"23164244","pubdate":"2012-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Administration","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"110","title":"Managing symptoms during cancer treatments: evaluating the implementation of evidence-informed remote support protocols","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/managing-symptoms-during-cancer-treatments-evaluating-implementation-evidenceinformed-remote-support"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3350725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1480981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282884,"mean":6.1046995825128,"rank":171712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":96208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282884,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":826,"mean":8.7345527272727,"rank":756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":826,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":6.1357142857143,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":5,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
