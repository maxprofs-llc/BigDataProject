Standard chemotherapy targets all dividing cells, resulting in dose-limiting toxicities. In this study, we demonstrated a strategy of encapsulating a hydrophobic synthetic compound, nifetepimine, having anticancer properties, in poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles to increase selectivity of drug to cancerous cells with minimum toxicity towards normal cells. Nanoencapsulated nifetepimine (30-100 nm) having loading and encapsulation efficiency of 7.45% and 75% respectively, was successfully internalized inside TNBC cells upon sustained release resulting in apoptosis. An in vivo bio-distribution study indicated that nanonifetepimine selectively accumulated into breast tumor sites of mice, primarily due to prolonged blood circulation time and binding of nifetepimine to epidermal growth factor receptor that remains overexpressed in most of the TNBC tumors. Moreover, we observed significant reduction in breast tumor volume with improved survival implying high tumor targetability of nanonifetepimine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823b","authors":["Aparajita Ghosh","Arijit Bhowmik","Suman Bhandary","Salil Putatunda","Aparna Laskar","Atanu Biswas","Sandip Dolui","Bhaswati Banerjee","Rajni Khan","Nirmalendu Das","Arijit Chakraborty","Mrinal Kanti Ghosh","Parimal C.
