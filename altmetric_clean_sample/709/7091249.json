We have recently demonstrated the anti-neoplastic effect of Amla extract (Emblica officinalis, AE) on OC cells in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that AE attenuates growth of OC through microRNA (miR)-regulated mechanism(s). The inhibitory effect of AE on proliferation, migration and invasiveness (P\u22640.001) of SKOV3 cells and >90% attenuation of tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model suggested multiple targets. RT-qPCR analysis of microRNAs associated with OC showed a >2,000-fold increase in the expression of miR-375 in AE-treated SKOV3 cells that was blocked by an exogenous miR-375 inhibitor (P\u22640.001). AE also decreased the gene and protein expression of IGF1R, a target of miR-375 (P\u22640.001), and SNAIL1 (P\u22640.002), an EMT-associated transcription factor that represses E-cadherin expression (P\u22640.003). AE increased E-cadherin expression (P\u22640.001). Treatment of SKOV3 cells with AE resulted in increased miR-375 in exosomes in the medium (P\u22640.01). Finally, AE significantly decreased the expression of IGF1R and SNAIL1 proteins during attenuation of SKOV3-derived xenograft tumor. Together, these results show that AE modulates cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment via activation of miR-375 and by targeting IGF1R and SNAIL1 in OC cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["De, Alok","Powers, Benjamin","De, Archana","Zhou, Jianping","Sharma, Siddarth","Van Veldhuizen, Peter","Bansal, Ajay","Sharma, Ramratan","Sharma, Mukut"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.8966","first_seen_on":"2016-04-30T12:56:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"21","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1462037134,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27129171?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27129171","pubdate":"2014-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"<i>Emblica officinalis<\/i> extract downregulates pro-angiogenic molecules via upregulation of cellular and exosomal miR-375 in human ovarian cancer cells","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emblica-officinalis-extract-downregulates-proangiogenic-molecules-via-upregulation-cellular-exosomal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7628277,"mean":6.5635637575213,"rank":3918999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3682687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7628277,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266355,"mean":11.392435638286,"rank":143358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":121810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266355,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7502,"mean":2.9513680842554,"rank":2375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":5088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7502,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":6.3135217391304,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
