Depressive symptoms were measured using the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.\nWithin individuals (actor effects), greater frailty predicted greater subsequent depressive symptoms, and greater depressive symptoms predicted greater subsequent frailty. Between spouses (partner effects), an individual's greater frailty predicted the spouse's greater frailty, and an individual's greater depressive symptoms predicted the spouse's greater depressive symptoms.\nFrailty and depressive symptoms are interrelated in older adult spouses. For older couples, interventions to prevent or treat frailty and depression that focus on couples may be more effective than those that focus on individuals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5a","authors":["Monin, Joan","Doyle, Margaret","Levy, Becca","Schulz, Richard","Fried, Terri","Kershaw, Trace"],"doi":"10.1111\/jgs.14023","endpage":"830","first_seen_on":"2016-04-30T14:39:51+00:00","funders":["niehs","phs","nhlbi"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1532-5415"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","last_mentioned_on":1502118000,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14023\/abstract;jsessionid=9B142271CD233AF7F57288CAF07D595E.f04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14023\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14023\/abstract;jsessionid=5B3F4EF9E223F4A9F1D33B3A83180C49.f04t04","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jgs.14023","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1111\/jgs.14023","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14023\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14023\/full?hootPostID=12966b398e79474f1af0890bc55a241b","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14023","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27100578"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14023\/pdf","pmid":"27100578","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"824","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Spousal Associations Between Frailty and Depressive Symptoms: Longitudinal Findings from the Cardiovascular Health Study","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spousal-associations-between-frailty-depressive-symptoms-longitudinal-findings-cardiovascular-health"},"altmetric_score":{"score":137.58,"score_history":{"1y":9.25,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":137.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":56898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8279846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271387,"mean":11.575217535171,"rank":4149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":267238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271387,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3789,"mean":13.433162090813,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":3731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3789,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":25.887663551402,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
