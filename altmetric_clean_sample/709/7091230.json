However, the underlying mechanisms still remain elusive. Here we report that EZH1 physically interacts with UXT, one small chaperon-like transcription co-activator. UXT specifically interacts with EZH1 and SUZ12, but not EED. Similar to UXT, RNA interference of EZH1 or SUZ12 in the cell impairs the transcriptional activation of NF-\u03baB target genes induced by TNF\u03b1. EZH1 deficiency also increases TNF\u03b1-induced cell death. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation and the following next generation sequencing analysis show that H3K27 mono-, di- and trimethylation on NF-\u03baB target genes are not affected in EZH1 or UXT deficient cells. EZH1 does not affect RELA\/p65 translocation from cytosol to nuclear either. Instead, EZH1 and SUZ12 regulate the recruitment of RELA\/p65 and RNA Pol II to target genes. Taken together, our study found that EZH1 and SUZ12 as positive regulators for NF-\u03baB signaling and demonstrated the underlying mechanism that EZH1, SUZ12 and UXT work synergistically to regulate pathway activation in the nucleus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce4","authors":["Su, Shuai-Kun","Li, Chun-Yuan","Lei, Pin-Ji","Wang, Xiang","Zhao, Quan-Yi","Cai, Yang","Wang, Zhen","Li, Lianyun","Wu, Min"],"doi":"10.1242\/jcs.185546","first_seen_on":"2016-04-30T12:52:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9137","0021-9533"],"journal":"Journal of Cell Science","last_mentioned_on":1462020716,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27127229?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27127229","pubdate":"2016-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"jcs.185546","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"\n              EZH1\/SUZ12 complex positively regulates the transcription of NF-\u03baB target genes\n              via\n              interaction with UXT\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ezh1-suz12-complex-positively-regulates-transcription-nf-%CE%BA-b-target-genes-through-interaction-uxt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7628277,"mean":6.5635637575213,"rank":6602295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7628277,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266354,"mean":11.392564198638,"rank":223046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266354,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3158,"mean":4.403925878999,"rank":2924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3158,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":3.3875072463768,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/726393648456159233","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7091230],"posted_on":"2016-04-30T12:51:56+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
