Among these newborns, 104 (82, both ears; 22, one ear; total, 186 ears) received regular follow-up and were recruited as subjects. The relationship between infant click-evoked ABR thresholds and the corresponding child PTA thresholds was determined through Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression analyses.\nThe correlation coefficient between click-evoked ABR thresholds and behavioral PTA thresholds at the average of frequencies of 1-4 and 2-4\u00a0kHz was 0.76 and 0.76, respectively. Linear regression analysis showed that behavioral audiometry thresholds at the average of frequencies of 1-4 and 2-4\u00a0kHz were accurately estimated from click-evoked ABR thresholds in 57% and 58% children, respectively.\nClick-evoked ABR testing is a reliable tool to cautiously estimate behavioral PTA thresholds at the average of frequencies of 1-4 and 2-4\u00a0kHz. For accurately performing hearing aid fitting and auditory rehabilitation in congenitally deaf infants, a combination of frequency-specific tone-burst ABR and click-evoked ABR should be used.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b88","authors":["Tsun-Min Lu","Fang-Wei Wu","Hsiuwen Chang","Hung-Ching Lin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijporl.2017.02.004","first_seen_on":"2017-06-04T20:49:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["01655876","1872-8464"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1496609346,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28576534?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0165587617300642&_version=1&md5=4d21befe39d5225191c3350a7108b304"],"pmid":"28576534","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology","pediatrics"],"title":"Using click-evoked auditory brainstem response thresholds in infants to estimate the corresponding pure-tone audiometry thresholds in children referred from UNHS","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-clickevoked-auditory-brainstem-response-thresholds-infants-estimate-corresponding-puretone-aud"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":6311338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1126032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241699,"mean":12.203854769175,"rank":170643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241699,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1886,"mean":1.7701931034483,"rank":1028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1886,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":0.53217821782178,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
