In an attempt to extrapolate the heavy metal hyperaccumulating phenotype to yeast, we obtained Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells armed with non-natural metal-binding hexapeptides targeted to the inner face of the plasma membrane, expected to sequester the metal ions once they penetrated the cell. We describe the construction of S. cerevisiae strains overexpressing metal-binding hexapeptides (MeBHxP) fused to the carboxy-terminus of a myristoylated green fluorescent protein (myrGFP). Three non-toxic myrGFP-MeBHxP (myrGFP-H6, myrGFP-C6, and myrGFP-(DE)3) were investigated against an array of heavy metals in terms of their effect on S. cerevisiae growth, heavy metal (hyper) accumulation, and capacity to remove heavy metal from contaminated environments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022dc","authors":["Ruta, Lavinia Liliana","Kissen, Ralph","Nicolau, Ioana","Neagoe, Aurora Daniela","Petrescu, Andrei Jos\u00e9","Bones, Atle M.","Farcasanu, Ileana Cornelia","Lavinia Liliana Ruta","Ralph Kissen","Ioana Nicolau","Aurora Daniela Neagoe","Andrei Jos\u00e9 Petrescu","Atle M.
