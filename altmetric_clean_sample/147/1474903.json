Specifically, persister cells grow more slowly than normal cells under unstressed growth conditions, but survive longer under stress conditions such as the treatment with bactericidal antibiotics. We analyze the population dynamics of such a population for several typical experimental scenarios, namely a constant environment, shifts between growth and stress conditions, and periodically switching environments. We use an approximation scheme that allows us to map the dynamics to a logistic equation for the subpopulation ratio and derive explicit analytical expressions for observable quantities that can be used to extract underlying dynamic parameters from experimental data. Our results provide a theoretical underpinning for the study of phenotypic switching, in particular for organisms where detailed mechanistic knowledge is scarce.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Pintu Patra","Stefan Klumpp"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0062814","first_seen_on":"2013-05-14T21:59:12+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1368548982,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0062814"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0062814.pdf","pmid":"23675428","pubdate":"2013-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e62814","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Population Dynamics of Bacterial Persistence","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/population-dynamics-bacterial-persistence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3073981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":951994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89220,"mean":7.057054708078,"rank":60425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":17870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89220,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80037,"mean":8.3320977809987,"rank":56118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80037,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4062,"mean":8.7314745136666,"rank":2924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4062,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
