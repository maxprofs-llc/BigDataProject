This process includes oxidative addition of two RI (R = Me, Et) molecules to the non-transition metal complex and results in an alkyl transfer to ring carbon atoms with the formation of two new C-C bonds. The interaction proceeds at mild conditions and gives new indium(III) derivatives containing iminocyclohexa-1,4-dienolate type ligands.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Alexandr Vladimirovich Piskunov","Irina N Meshcheryakova","Georgii K Fukin","Andrei S Shavyrin","Vladimir Kuz'mich Cherkasov","Gleb Arsent'evich Abakumov","Alexandr V.
