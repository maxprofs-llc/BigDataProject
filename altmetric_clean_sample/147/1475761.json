For 1772 C\/T polymorphism (rs11549465), it included 5552 cases and 8044 controls, and for 1790 G\/A (rs11549467), 3381 cases and 5830 controls. The allele-analysis results showed that 1772 C\/T (rs11549465) was significantly associated with cancers (OR: 1.177, 95% CI: 1.011-1.369, p=0.035). And results of genotype-analysis indicated that 1790 G\/A (rs11549467) had a significant relationship with cancers. (OR: 0.736, 95% CI: 0.595-0.910, p=0.005). For 1790 G\/A (rs11549467), the association was significant when subdivided by different kinds of cancers. And no association existed when subdivided into population-type subgroups. In conclusion, PASD8 gene played an important role in the development of cancers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["Liu J","Zhang H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gene.2013.03.129","first_seen_on":"2013-05-15T02:55:19+00:00","issns":["0378-1119","03781119"],"journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":1368552791,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378111913004241"],"pmid":"23583797","pubdate":"2013-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"1790 G\/A polymorphism, but not 1772 C\/T polymorphism, is significantly associated with Cancers: An update study ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/1790-ga-polymorphism-not-1772-ct-polymorphism-significantly-associated-cancers-update-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":959535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89289,"mean":7.0601050757102,"rank":61138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89289,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991,"mean":2.0530992481203,"rank":2609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.4232558139535,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
