A key issue in this synthesis was construction of an oxabicyclo[3.2.1] skeleton, which was solved by the development of an intramolecular Ferrier-type C-glycosylation of a glucal with siloxyfuran as an internal nucleophile. The substrate was prepared from D-glucal by the introduction of trimethylsilylacetylene and siloxyfuran groups. Although C-glycosylation did not occur under the conditions found from model experiments, further examination revealed that the combination of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) and 2,4,6-collidine successfully afforded the desired product as a single diastereomer. The siloxy group at the C3 position played a crucial role in the stereocontrol of this reaction. The product was further transformed into a tetracyclic compound as follows: The vinyl ether and acetylenic moieties were reduced and the siloxy group was removed with a Barton-McCombie reaction. The construction of the six-membered ether and the \u03b3-lactone provided the tetracyclic compound. Finally, a phenolic moiety was introduced by using a Mukaiyama aldol reaction to furnish polygalolide\u2005A.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Yamada, Hitomi","Adachi, Masaatsu","Isobe, Minoru","Nishikawa, Toshio"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201300362","endpage":"1435","first_seen_on":"2013-05-13T22:01:20+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1861-471X","1861-4728"],"issue":"7","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1368604801,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201300362\/abstract;jsessionid=72093907CEB48CC5EA96D4F4CCFA428B.d01t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/asia.201300362","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201300362\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201300362\/pdf","pmid":"23670825","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1428","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Stereocontrolled Total Synthesis of Polygalolide\u00e2\u0080\u0085A","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stereocontrolled-total-synthesis-polygalolide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6645224,"mean":6.1549594892423,"rank":3169774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1981733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6645224,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114333,"mean":6.6310058951126,"rank":53016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":47173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114333,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2032,"mean":1.3658670605613,"rank":362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2032,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.71363636363636,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemAsianJ\/statuses\/334064637664436226","license":"public","citation_ids":[1471821],"posted_on":"2013-05-13T21:56:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Chem.
