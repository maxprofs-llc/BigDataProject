These new (iminophosphorane)silver(I) coordination polymers are efficient catalyst precursors for the Meyer-Schuster isomerization of both terminal and internal alkynols. Reactions proceeded in water, under aerobic conditions and using microwave irradiation as heating source, to afford the corresponding \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds in excellent yields, without the addition of any cocatalyst. Remarkably, it should be noted that this catalytic system can be recycled up to 10 consecutive runs (1st cycle 45 min, 99%; 10th cycle 6 h, 97%). ESI-MS analysis of 5a in water has been carried out providing valuable insight into the monomeric active species responsible for catalytic activity in water.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda-\u00c1lvarez","Josefina D\u00edez","Cristian Vidal","Cristian Vicent"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic400511d","first_seen_on":"2013-05-15T23:56:44+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1368661967,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic400511d"],"pmid":"23675864","pubdate":"2013-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"130515133453002","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"New Ag(I)\u2013Iminophosphorane Coordination Polymers as Efficient Catalysts Precursors for the MW-Assisted Meyer\u2013Schuster Rearrangement of Propargylic Alcohols in Water","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-agiiminophosphorane-coordination-polymers-efficient-catalysts-precursors-mwassisted-meyerschuste"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3555491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89291,"mean":7.0640887669393,"rank":71446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89291,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.4086585528509,"rank":4155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":408,"mean":0.82862407862408,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":408,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
