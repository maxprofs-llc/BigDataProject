The Megavirales virome, which we refer to as the megavirome, has been largely neglected until now because of the use of technical procedures that have jeopardized the discovery of giant viruses, particularly the use of filters with pore sizes in the 0.2-0.45-\u03bcm range. Concurrently, there has been accumulating evidence supporting the role of Mimivirus, discovered while investigating a pneumonia outbreak using amoebal coculture, as a causative agent in pneumonia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d09","authors":["Colson P","Fancello L","Gimenez G","Armougom F","Desnues C","Fournous G","Yoosuf N","Million M","La Scola B","Raoult D","Colson, Philippe","Fancello, Laura","Gimenez, Gregory","Armougom, Fabrice","Desnues, Christelle","Fournous, Ghislain","Yoosuf, Niyaz","Million, Matthieu","La Scola, Bernard","Raoult, Didier","Philippe Colson","Laura Fancello","Gregory Gimenez","Fabrice Armougom","Christelle Desnues","Ghislain Fournous","Niyaz Yoosuf","Matthieu Million","Bernard La Scola","Didier Raoult"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcv.2013.03.018","first_seen_on":"2013-05-15T09:10:47+00:00","issns":["1873-5967","13866532","1386-6532"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","last_mentioned_on":1499483425,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23664726","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1386653213001248","http:\/\/www.journalofclinicalvirology.com\/article\/S1386-6532(13)00124-8\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jcv.2013.03.018"],"pmid":"23664726","pubdate":"2013-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Evidence of the megavirome in humans ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-megavirome-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":27,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":27},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177940,"mean":6.9186814093318,"rank":318101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7858714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177940,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121660,"mean":6.9413555922703,"rank":5409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":116223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121660,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":888,"mean":4.3166335963923,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":888,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.575,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
