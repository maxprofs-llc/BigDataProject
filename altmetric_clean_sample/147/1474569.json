The genetic subtypes of PWS are classified into deletion (~70%), maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD; 25-30%), imprinting center defects (3-5%) and rare unbalanced translocations. Recently, Matsubara et al. reported a significantly higher maternal age in a trisomy rescue (TR) or gamete complementation (GC) by nondisjunction at maternal meiosis 1 (M1) group than in a deletion group. In the present study, we try to confirm their findings in an ethnically different population. A total of 97 Korean PWS patients were classified into deletional type (n=66), TR\/GC (M1) (n=15), TR\/GC by nondisjunction at maternal meiosis 2 (n=2), monosomy rescue or postfertilization mitotic nondisjunction (n=4) and epimutation (n=2). Maternal ages at birth showed a significant difference between the deletion group (median age of 29, interquartile range (IQR)=(27,31)) and the TR\/GC (M1) group (median age of 35, IQR=(31,38)) (P<0.0001). The relative birth frequency of the TR\/GC (M1) group has substantially increased since 2006 when compared with the period before 2005. These findings support the hypothesis that the advanced maternal age at childbirth is a predisposing factor for the development of mUPD because of increased M1 errors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002de4","authors":["Sung Yoon Cho","Chang-Seok Ki","Young Bae Sohn","Se Hyun Maeng","You Jin Jung","Su Jin Kim","Dong-Kyu Jin"],"doi":"10.1038\/jhg.2012.148","first_seen_on":"2013-05-14T21:18:39+00:00","issns":["1434-5161","1435-232X"],"journal":"Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1366329600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/jhg.2012.148"],"pmid":"23303386","pubdate":"2013-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"The proportion of uniparental disomy is increased in Prader|[ndash]|Willi syndrome due to an advanced maternal childbearing age in Korea","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proportion-uniparental-disomy-increased-praderwilli-syndrome-due-advanced-maternal-childbearing-age"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627324,"mean":4.9493148749129,"rank":2018424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":932160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627324,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85146,"mean":6.8509823242704,"rank":44161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":25084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85146,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":540,"mean":4.0174508348794,"rank":402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":540,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.2961111111111,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
