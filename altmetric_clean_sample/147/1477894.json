This results from a double over-interpretation of predictive coding's significance. First, Clark argues that predictive coding offers a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) of brain function. Second, he over-reads its epistemic import, perhaps even conflating causal and epistemic mediators. We argue instead for a plurality of neurofunctional principles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023a1","doi":"10.1017\/s0140525x1200221x","first_seen_on":"2013-05-15T10:24:11+00:00","issns":["1469-1825"],"journal":"Behavioral & Brain Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1383221585,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23663557?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23663557","pubdate":"2013-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain","psychology","neurology"],"title":"The problem with brain GUTs: Conflation of different senses of \"prediction\" threatens metaphysical disaster.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/problem-brain-guts-conflation-different-senses-prediction-threatens-metaphysical-disaster"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1785723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2639825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89291,"mean":7.0640814872888,"rank":31681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":55759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89291,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":804,"mean":8.1086799501867,"rank":328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":804,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.6083333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
