Because of severe hypoxemia, the patient required mechanical ventilation and additional oxygenation by an intravascular oxygenator. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and survived without sequelae. Severe pulmonary involvement associated with EBV infection is a rare but potentially fatal complication of infectious mononucleosis. Similar cases reported in the literature are reviewed, and the therapeutic options for this particular complication are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["M.
