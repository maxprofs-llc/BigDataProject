Hyperglycemia is an on-target side effect of many inhibitors of PI3K\/Akt signaling including the specific PI3K inhibitor PX-866. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist pioglitazone, used to treat type 2 diabetes, prevents a decrease in glucose tolerance caused by acute administration of PX-866. Our studies have shown that pioglitazone does not inhibit the antitumor activity of PX-866 in A-549 non-small cell lung cancer and HT-29 colon cancer xenografts. In vitro studies also showed that pioglitazone increases 2-[1-(14)C]deoxy-D-glucose uptake in L-6 muscle cells and prevents inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by PX-866. Neither pioglitazone nor PX-866 had an effect on 2-deoxyglucose uptake in A-549 lung cancer cells. In vivo imaging studies using [18F]2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography showed that pioglitazone increases FDG accumulation by normal tissue but does not significantly alter FDG uptake by A-549 xenografts. Thus, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists may be useful in overcoming the increase in blood glucose caused by inhibitors of PI3K signaling by preventing the inhibition of normal tissue insulin-mediated glucose uptake without affecting antitumor activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e0","authors":["Ihle NT","Lemos R","Schwartz D","Oh J","Halter RJ","Wipf P","Kirkpatrick L","Powis G","N.
