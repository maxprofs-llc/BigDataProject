We followed the relaxation of a (13)C tracer in fine roots in a Liquidambar styraciflua plantation at the conclusion of a free-air CO(2) enrichment experiment. Goals included quantifying the relative fractions of new photosynthate vs stored C used in root growth and root respiration, as well as the turnover rate of fine-root C fixed during [CO(2)] fumigation. New fine-root growth was largely from recent photosynthate, while nearly one-quarter of respired C was from a storage pool. Changes in the isotopic composition of the fine-root population over two full growing seasons indicated heterogeneous C pools; < 10% of root C had a residence time < 3 months, while a majority of root C had a residence time > 2 yr. Compared to a one-pool model, a two-pool model for C turnover in fine roots (with 5 and 0.37 yr(-1) turnover times) doubles the fine-root contribution to forest NPP (9-13%) and supports the 50% root-to-soil transfer rate often used in models.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031cc","authors":["Lynch, Douglas J.","Matamala, Roser","Iversen, Colleen M.","Norby, Richard J.","Gonzalez\u2010Meler, Miquel A."],"doi":"10.1111\/nph.12290","endpage":"430","first_seen_on":"2013-05-13T19:17:21+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1469-8137","0028-646X"],"issue":"2","journal":"New Phytologist","last_mentioned_on":1368583287,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nph.12290\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nph.12290\/abstract;jsessionid=33773B10D0B32B58C873AF5598572C4C.d01t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nph.12290\/pdf","pmid":"23646982","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"420","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Stored carbon partly fuels fine\u00e2\u0080\u0090root respiration but is not used for production of new fine roots","type":"article","volume":"199","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stored-carbon-partly-fuels-fineroot-respiration-not-used-production-new-fine-roots"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6710513,"mean":6.1614211824654,"rank":2774892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3908660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6710513,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114915,"mean":6.6203053761945,"rank":43517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":70670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114915,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3090,"mean":7.0923845904824,"rank":2181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3090,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":9.1666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Ph.
