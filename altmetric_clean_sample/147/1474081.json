However, the site of its action, as well as the mechanism to activate AMPK, remains elusive. Here we report how metformin activates AMPK. In cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, metformin dose-dependently activated AMPK in parallel with increased detection of reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Further, either depletion of mitochondria or adenoviral overexpression of superoxide dismutases, as well as inhibition of nitric-oxide synthase, abolished the metformin-enhanced phosphorylations and activities of AMPK, implicating that activation of AMPK by metformin might be mediated by the mitochondria-derived RNS. Furthermore, administration of metformin, which increased 3-nitrotyrosine staining in hearts of C57BL6, resulted in parallel activation of AMPK in the aorta and hearts of C57BL6 mice but not in those of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) knockout mice in which metformin had no effect on 3-nitrotyrosine staining. Because the eNOS knockout mice expressed normal levels of AMPK-alpha that was activated by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside, an AMPK agonist, these data indicate that RNS generated by metformin is required for AMPK activation in vivo. In addition, metformin significantly increased the co-immunoprecipitation of AMPK and its upstream kinase, LKB1, in C57BL6 mice administered to metformin in vivo. Using pharmacological and genetic inhibitors, we found that inhibition of either c-Src or PI3K abolished AMPK that was enhanced by metformin. We conclude that activation of AMPK by metformin might be mediated by mitochondria-derived RNS, and activation of the c-Src\/PI3K pathway might generate a metabolite or other molecule inside the cell to promote AMPK activation by the LKB1 complex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["M.-H.
