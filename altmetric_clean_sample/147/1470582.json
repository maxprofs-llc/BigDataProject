Many Kv1.3 and KC a 3.1 blockers have a more favorable adverse event profiles than existing immunosuppressants, suggesting the selectivity of Kv1.3 and KC a 3.1 blockade. The Kv1.3 and KC a 3.1 blockers exert differential effects in different autoimmune diseases. The Kv1.3 inhibitors or gene deletion have been shown to have benefits in multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The KC a 3.1 blockers have demonstrated efficacy in human primary biliary cirrhosis and showed protective effects in animal models of severe colitis, allergic encephalomyelitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis. The KC a 3.1 blockers are not considered candidates for treatment of multiple sclerosis. The selective immunosuppressive effects of the Kv1.3 and KC a 3.1 blockers are due to the differences in their distribution on autoimmune-related immune cells and tissues and \u03b21 integrin (very late activating antigen)-Kv1.3 channel cross-talk.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e5","authors":["Wang, Jun","Xiang, Ming"],"doi":"10.1002\/phar.1236","endpage":"528","first_seen_on":"2013-05-13T16:58:32+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1875-9114","0277-0008"],"issue":"5","journal":"Pharmacotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1373496253,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/phar.1236\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/phar.1236"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/phar.1236\/pdf","pmid":"23649812","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"515","subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Targeting Potassium Channels Kv1.3 and KCa3.1: Routes to Selective Immunomodulators in Autoimmune Disorder Treatment?","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeting-potassium-channels-kv13-kca31-routes-selective-immunomodulators-autoimmune-disorder-treatm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6672563,"mean":6.1583365513853,"rank":1082709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5585423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6672563,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114516,"mean":6.6323338776581,"rank":20038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":94373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114516,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":899,"mean":4.5194699331849,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":899,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":7.5242857142857,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
