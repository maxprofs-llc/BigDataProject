CCR5 exists in multiple conformations in the membrane and is present at low levels on human macrophages, making it difficult to detect. Nine commercially available anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies were evaluated for their specificity and their recognition of CCR5 expressed by macrophages. Unexpectedly, we found that three of the nine clones tested displayed substantial background binding to CCR5 negative cells, suggesting that these antibodies may give unreliable results. We recommend the use of clones CTC8, 45531 (PE conjugated), and 45523 and advise that data obtained using CTC5, 45531 (unconjugated), and 45549 anti-CCR5 antibody clones should be interpreted with care.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a20","authors":["Laura Bernstone","Bonnie van Wilgenburg","William James"],"doi":"10.1089\/hyb.2010.0092","endpage":"19","first_seen_on":"2012-04-19T15:08:22+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["1554-0014","1557-8348"],"issue":"1","journal":"Hybridoma: A Journal of Molecular Immunology & Experimental & Clinical Immunotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1438774185,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/hyb.2010.0092"],"pmid":"22316480","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"7","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Several Commercially Available Anti-CCR5 Monoclonal Antibodies Lack Specificity and Should Be Used with Caution","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/several-commercially-available-anticcr5-monoclonal-antibodies-lack-specificity-used-caution"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446775,"mean":6.3436252636902,"rank":2352064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3021121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446775,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80211,"mean":4.8841629472634,"rank":27110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":52108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80211,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.694,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
