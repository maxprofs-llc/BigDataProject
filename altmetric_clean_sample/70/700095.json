If a local flap transfer cannot be performed, columella reconstruction becomes a significant challenge for the surgeon. The columella of a healthy 30-year-old woman whose nose was scarred and contracted because of cocaine abuse, was successfully reconstructed by transferring a microvascular free flap from the first web space of the foot. The reconstructed columella had a satisfactory contour and a good texture, although there was slight, albeit unproblematic, color mismatching.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a2c","doi":"10.1097\/sap.0b013e31822af8b9","first_seen_on":"2012-04-17T02:19:52+00:00","issns":["0148-7043"],"issue":"","journal":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1346754734,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Columella_Reconstruction_Using_a_Free_Flap_From.99332.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Columella_Reconstruction_Using_a_Free_Flap_From.99332.pdf","pmid":"21862919","pubdate":"2012-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Columella Reconstruction Using a Free Flap From the First Web Space of the Foot","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/columella-reconstruction-using-free-flap-first-web-space-foot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4202116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77907,"mean":4.7370120914949,"rank":63734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77907,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1961,"mean":1.039462244898,"rank":1347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1961,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149,"mean":0.45371621621622,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AnnalsofPlSrgy\/status\/242933079306563585","citation_ids":[700095],"posted_on":"2012-09-04T10:32:14+00:00","author":{"name":"APSOnlineJrl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611398882\/APS_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief: William C.
