The leads were suggested by the observation that keto- and diketo-acids bind to the active site Mg(2+)\/Asp domain in HIV-1 integrase, and similar domains are present in prenyl transferases. We report the x-ray crystallographic structures of one diketo-acid and one keto-acid bound to CrtM, which supports the Mg(2+) binding hypothesis, together with the x-ray structure of one diketo-acid bound to UPPS. In all cases, the inhibitors bind to a farnesyl diphosphate substrate-binding site. Compound 45 had cell growth inhibition MIC(90) values of ~250-500 ng\/mL against S. aureus, 500 ng\/mL against Bacillus anthracis, 4 \u03bcg\/mL against Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecium, and 1 \u03bcg\/mL against Streptococcus pyogenes M1, but very little activity against E. coli (DH5\u03b1, K12) or human cell lines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006815","authors":["Yonghui Zhang","Fu-Yang Lin","Kai Li","Wei Zhu","Yi-Liang Liu","Rong Cao","Ran Pang","Eunhae Lee","Jordan Axelson","Mary Hensler","Ke Wang","Katie J.
