The formation of a Th2 cell predominant inflammation in addition to production of allergen-specific IgE, the attraction of proinflammatory cells and the degranulation of effector cells, such as mast cells, are essential mechanisms in allergy development. Tregs aim to diminish these effects by IL-10- and TGF-\u03b2-mediated anti-inflammatory reactions and therefore are one of the main targets in SIT. The induction of allergen tolerance is the key to successful SIT. With a special focus on Tregs, this review aims to clarify what is currently known about allergy development and the mode of action in allergen-SIT, which helps to develop further therapeutic strategies in the fight against allergic diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000772f","authors":["Michael B Soyka","David Holzmann","Cezmi A
