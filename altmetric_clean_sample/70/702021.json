A targeted metabolomics method has been developed for the quantification of 135 phenolics, such as benzoates, phenylpropanoids, coumarins, stilbenes, dihydrochalcones, and flavonoids, in fruit and tea extracts and wine using UPLC\/QqQ-MS\/MS. Chromatography was optimized to achieve separation of the compounds over a period of 15 min, and MRM transitions were selected for accurate quantification. The method was validated by studying the detection and quantification limits, the linearity ranges, and the intraday and interday repeatability of the analysis. The validated method was applied to the analysis of apples, berries, green tea, and red wine, providing a valuable tool for food quality evaluation and breeding studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Urska Vrhovsek","Domenico Masuero","Mattia Gasperotti","Pietro Franceschi","Lorenzo Caputi","Roberto Viola","Fulvio Mattivi"],"doi":"10.1021\/jf2051569","first_seen_on":"2012-04-18T05:36:53+00:00","issns":["0021-8561","1520-5118"],"journal":"Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1334726671,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jf2051569"],"pmid":"22468648","pubdate":"2012-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"120403065155003","subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"A versatile targeted metabolomics method for rapid quantification of multiple classes of phenolics in fruit and beverages","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/versatile-targeted-metabolomics-method-rapid-quantification-multiple-classes-phenolics-fruits-bevera"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":2018491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72419,"mean":4.1846212543842,"rank":31704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":27351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72419,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3301,"mean":4.5836709090909,"rank":1772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3301,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":2.2641136363636,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
