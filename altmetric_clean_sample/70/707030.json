Circulating maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D and intact parathyroid hormone were measured at entry to care 13.73 \u00b1 5.6 weeks (mean \u00b1 SD). Intake of vitamin D and calcium was assessed at three time points during pregnancy. Using recent Institute of Medicine guidelines, 10.8% of the gravidae were at risk of vitamin D deficiency, and 23.8% at risk of insufficiency. Maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D was related positively to vitamin D and calcium intakes and negatively to circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Risk for cesarean delivery was increased significantly for vitamin D deficient women; there was no increased risk for gravidae at risk of insufficiency. When specific indications were examined, vitamin D deficiency was linked to a 2-fold increased risk of cesarean for prolonged labor. Results were the similar when prior guidelines for vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 37.5nmol\/L) and insufficiency (37.5-80 nmol\/L) were utilized.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6573cf058f610009228","authors":["Theresa O.
