Complications are rare (< 1%) but potentially severe, since intraabdominal perforations can occur. We report a case of a 58 year-old male presenting with an abscess in the left gluteal region caused by a perforating screwdriver in the rectosigmoideum. The screwdriver was removed during a laparotomy and he got a temporary stoma but made complete recovery, and a stoma reversal was planned. The risk of insufficient patient counselling due to taboos is discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd48","authors":["Spanager L","Mohr M"],"first_seen_on":"2012-04-23T04:00:10+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"49","journal":"Ugeskrift for laeger","last_mentioned_on":1352439056,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22142607"],"pmid":"22142607","pubdate":"2011-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[An unusual case of a screwdriver found in rectum.]","type":"article","volume":"173","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unusual-case-screwdriver-found-rectum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616176,"mean":4.9318698536468,"rank":1530068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1986846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616176,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72431,"mean":4.2038291315753,"rank":20426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":50433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72431,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255,"mean":1.742811023622,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.45588235294118,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OSingh91\/statuses\/266774854462734336","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[709464],"posted_on":"2012-11-09T05:30:56+00:00","author":{"name":"O.
