The pathogenesis of PEP has been poorly understood. The authors studied p53 expression and gene mutation in PEPs by immunohistochemistry, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and direct sequencing in paraffin material from 8 PEPs. A group of classic angiomyolipomas (AMLs) were also analyzed for comparison. Five PEPs were from kidneys and 1 each from the heart, the liver, and the uterus. PEPs showed much stronger p53 nuclear staining (Allred score 6.4 \u00b1 2.5) than the classic AML (2.3 \u00b1 2.9) (P < .01). There was no p53 single-strand conformation polymorphism identified in either the PEPs or the 8 classic AMLs. p53 mutation analyses by direct sequencing of exons 5 to 9 showed 4 mutations in 3 of 8 PEPs but none in any of the 8 classic AMLs. The mutations included 2 missense mutations in a hepatic PEComa and 2 silent mutations in 2 renal PEPs. Both the missense mutations in the hepatic PEComa involved the exon 5, one involving codon 165, with change from CAG to CAC (coding amino acid changed from glutamine to histidine), and the other involving codon 182, with change from TGC to TAC (coding amino acid changed from cysteine to tyrosine). The finding of stronger p53 expression and mutations in epithelioid angiomyolipomas might have contributed to their less predictable behavior. However, the abnormal p53 expression cannot be entirely explained by p53 mutations in the exons examined in the PEPs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002bab","authors":["Zhanyong Bing","Yuan Yao","Theresa Pasha","John E.
