The adult heart retains a small population of nascent cells that have myeloid, mesenchymal, and mesodermal capabilities, which play an essential role in the recovery of ventricular function after injury. In aged individuals, these cells are diminished and dysfunctional. We evaluated the derivation of some of these cardiac progenitors and a method to restore their number and function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007331","doi":"10.1093\/eurheartj\/ehs072","first_seen_on":"2012-04-17T19:02:14+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1522-9645"],"journal":"European Heart Journal","last_mentioned_on":1350554924,"links":["http:\/\/eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/04\/15\/eurheartj.ehs072.full?keytype=ref&ijkey=SREZqDI3Q7EdoNu"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/04\/15\/eurheartj.ehs072.full.pdf","pmid":"22507976","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Reconstitution of aged bone marrow with young cells repopulates cardiac-resident bone marrow\u2013derived progenitor cells and prevents cardiac dysfunction after a myocardial infarction","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reconstitution-aged-bone-marrow-young-cells-repopulates-cardiacresident-bone-marrowderived-progenito"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1006944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2929811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75599,"mean":4.4578010264821,"rank":15860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":57182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75599,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2479,"mean":7.2527013720743,"rank":837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":1479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2479,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.7810666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
