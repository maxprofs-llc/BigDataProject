Additional standard vestibular testing, such as nystagmography, can show variable responses. In the last decade, the cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) has shown to be of additive value in diagnosing M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. In this study, the results of the ocular VEMP (oVEMP) in response to air-conducted sound will be discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000841d","authors":["Winters SM","Campschroer T","Grolman W","Klis SF"],"doi":"10.1097\/mao.0b013e31822e5ac9","first_seen_on":"2012-04-22T20:15:28+00:00","issns":["1531-7129"],"issue":"8","journal":"Otology & Neurotology","last_mentioned_on":1335125117,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/otology-neurotology\/Abstract\/2011\/10000\/Ocular_Vestibular_Evoked_Myogenic_Potentials_in.16.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/otology-neurotology\/2011\/10000\/Ocular_Vestibular_Evoked_Myogenic_Potentials_in.16.pdf","pmid":"21897327","pubdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1273","subjects":["otolaryngology","neurology"],"title":"Ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials in Response to Air-Conducted Sound in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's Disease","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ocular-vestibular-evoked-myogenic-potentials-response-airconducted-sound-m%C3%A9ni%C3%A8res-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770545,"mean":5.7208170586012,"rank":3993241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770545,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76490,"mean":4.7165752984089,"rank":63260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76490,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1863,"mean":1.4085907626208,"rank":1181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1863,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":0.67846153846154,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
