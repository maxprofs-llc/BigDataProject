However, producing SRs is resource-intensive, and progress in the research they review leads to SRs becoming outdated, requiring updates. Although the question of how and when to update SRs has been studied, the best method for determining when to update is still unclear, necessitating further research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c4","authors":["Aaron M Cohen","Aaron M Cohen","Kyle Ambert","Marian McDonagh"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6947-12-33","first_seen_on":"2012-04-23T01:08:33+00:00","issns":["1472-6947"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making","last_mentioned_on":1360763621,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6947\/12\/33\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6947-12-33.pdf"],"pmid":"22515596","pubdate":"2012-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Geomatic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"33","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Studying the potential impact of automated document classification on scheduling a systematic review update","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/studying-potential-impact-automated-document-classification-scheduling-systematic-review-update"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4686763,"mean":5.7045291158393,"rank":932834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3746581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4686763,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76020,"mean":4.7289834120417,"rank":13454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":62404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76020,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":786,"mean":4.113796178344,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":786,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.6777837837838,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
