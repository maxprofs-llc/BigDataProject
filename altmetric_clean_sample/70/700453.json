Only individuals heterogeneous at the csd allele develop into females, and the homozygous develop into diploid males, which do not survive. The honeybees are therefore under selection pressure to generate new csd alleles. Previous studies have shown that the csd gene is under balancing selection. We hypothesize that due to the long separation from the mainland of Hainan Island, China, that the giant honey bees (Apis dorsata) should show a founder effect for the csd gene, with many different alleles clustered together, and these would be absent on the mainland.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E4436L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Zhi Yong Liu","Zi Long Wang","Wei Yu Yan","Xiao Bo Wu","Zhi Jiang Zeng","Zachary Y.
