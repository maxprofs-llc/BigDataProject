However, chronic activation of these pathways can result in immunosuppression and has been linked to poor responses to genotoxic and radiotoxic therapies. Emerging evidence suggests energy, lipid and amino acid metabolism play an important role in regulating and fine tuning type I IFN responses. Further, dysregulation of these processes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic viral infections and autoimmune disorders. Systematic evaluation of these interrelationships in cancer models and patients may have important implications for the development of targeted IFN based anti-cancer therapeutics with minimal toxicity and limited off target effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249e","authors":["Duale Ahmed","Edana Cassol"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.canlet.2017.08.037","first_seen_on":"2017-09-09T06:32:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["03043835","1872-7980"],"journal":"Cancer Letters","last_mentioned_on":1505124680,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.canlet.2017.08.037","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28888999?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28888999","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Role of cellular metabolism in regulating type I interferon responses: Implications for tumour immunology and treatment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-cellular-metabolism-regulating-type-i-interferon-responses-implications-tumour-immunology-treat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8397236,"mean":7.0723276090205,"rank":4483105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2337539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8397236,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126423,"mean":11.911876809416,"rank":68349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":45344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126423,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2020,"mean":3.7193442298167,"rank":1074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2020,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":0.88190476190476,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TumImmTx_papers\/statuses\/907184777299554304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24991281],"posted_on":"2017-09-11T10:11:20+00:00","author":{"name":"TumImmTxpapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"TumImmTx_papers","tweeter_id":"2881001471","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":15},"tweet_id":"907184777299554304"}]}}
