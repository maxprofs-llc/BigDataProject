In view of the need to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure, establishing non-X-ray methods for investigating the clavicle has long been a key objective in forensic age assessment research. Based on magnetic resonance imaging examinations in a large sample of healthy subjects, the current study for the first time presents statistical measures which allow inferences to be drawn for forensic age assessment in both sexes. We undertook a prospective study of a reference sample of 334 female and 335 male German volunteers aged from 12 to 24 using a 3-T MRI scanner. A 3D FFE (fast field echo) T1-weighted sequence with fat saturation was acquired. To stage ossification of the medial clavicular epiphysis, we used the clavicular ossification staging systems described by Schmeling et al. and Kellinghaus et al. Ossification stage IIIc offers a means in both sexes of demonstrating that the age of 18 has been attained prior to complete ossification of the epiphyseal plate. In both sexes, if a subject has reached ossification stage IV, it can be stated that he or she has attained the age of 21. Magnetic resonance imaging is a valid diagnostic procedure for determining the ossification stage of the medial clavicular epiphysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b69","authors":["S.
