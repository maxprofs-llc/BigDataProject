Cases had undergone valve replacement in 11 hospitals between 2007-2015, a median 19 months prior to onset (range 3 months-5 years). Risk to patients increased after 2010 from <0.2 to 1.65\/10,000 person-years in 2013, a nine-fold rise for infections within 2y of surgery (RR=9.08, 95% CI 1.81-87.76). Endocarditis was the most common presentation (n=11). To date, 9 cases have died. Investigations identified aerosol release through breaches in heater-cooler tanks. M. chimaera and other pathogens were recovered from water and air samples. Phylogenetic analysis found close clustering of strains from probable cases.\nWe identified low but escalating risk of severe M. chimaera infection associated with heater-coolers with cases in a quarter of cardiothoracic centres. Our investigations strengthen aetiological evidence for heater-coolers' role in transmission and raise the possibility of an ongoing, international point-source outbreak. Active management of heater-coolers and heightened clinical awareness are imperative given the consequences of infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Meera Chand","Theresa Lamagni","Katharina Kranzer","Jessica Hedge","Ginny Moore","Simon Parks","Samuel Collins","Carlos del Ojo Elias","Nada Ahmed","Tim Brown","E Grace Smith","Peter Hoffman","Peter Kirwan","Brendan Mason","Alison Smith-Palmer","Philip Veal","Maeve K Lalor","Allan Bennett","James Walker","Alicia Yeap","Antonio Isidro Carrion Martin","Gayle Dolan","Sonia Bhatt","Andrew Skingsley","Andr\u00e9 Charlett","David Pearce","Katherine Russell","Simon Kendall","Andrew A Klein","Stephen Robins","Silke Schelenz","William Newsholme","Stephanie Thomas","Tim Collyns","Eleri Davies","Jim McMenamin","Lorraine Doherty","Tim EA Peto","Derrick Crook","Maria Zambon","Nick Phin","E.
