A validated LC-MS\/MS assay was developed to measure HS in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\nHS was extracted and digested and the resultant disaccharides were derivatized with a novel label, 4-butylaniline, enabling isoform separation and isotope-tagged analog introduction as an internal standard for LC-MS\/MS. The assay has a LLOQ for disaccharides of 0.1 \u03bcM, \u00b120% accuracy and \u226420% precision. CSF samples from patients with MPS IIIA showed elevated HS levels (mean 4.9 \u03bcM) compared with negative controls (0.37 \u03bcM).\nThis assay detected elevated HS levels in the CSF of patients with MPS IIIA and provides a method to assess experimental therapies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c2c","authors":["Hicham Naimy"],"doi":"10.4155\/bio.15.243","first_seen_on":"2016-02-20T06:24:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-6199"],"journal":"Bioanalysis","last_mentioned_on":1455713019,"links":["http:\/\/www.future-science.com\/doi\/abs\/10.4155\/bio.15.243"],"pmid":"26847798","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"A novel LC\u2013MS\/MS assay for heparan sulfate screening in the cerebrospinal fluid of mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-lcmsms-assay-heparan-sulfate-screening-cerebrospinal-fluid-mucopolysaccharidosis-iiia-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7206148,"mean":6.3472117046704,"rank":6213180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7206148,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283858,"mean":10.344582525708,"rank":237877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283858,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":483,"mean":1.7203734439834,"rank":430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":483,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.3265,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
