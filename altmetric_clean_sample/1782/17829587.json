Secondary measures included the Drug Effects Questionnaire, Addiction Research Center Inventory\/Morphine Benzedrine Group Subscale, Price Value Assessment Questionnaire, Global Assessment of Overall Drug Liking, and Take Drug Again Assessment. Central nervous system mu-opioid effects were assessed using pupillometry. The study included qualifying and treatment phases. Subjects received each of the five treatments using a crossover design.\n\u2002NKTR-181 at all dose levels had significantly lower Drug Liking E max than oxycodone ( P \u2009<\u20090.0001). Drug Liking scores for oxycodone increased rapidly within 15\u2009minutes and peaked at approximately one hour postdose, whereas Drug Liking (and most secondary abuse potential measures) for all doses of NKTR-181 were comparable with placebo for at least the first hour. Only the 400\u2009mg Drug Liking scores were minimally differentiated vs placebo from one and a half to four hours, but remained significantly lower than oxycodone ( P \u2009<\u20090.003). NKTR-181 treatment-related adverse effects were mild and occurred at a lower rate compared with oxycodone.\n\u2002NKTR-181 demonstrated delayed onset of CNS effects and significantly lower abuse potential scores compared with oxycodone in recreational opioid users.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003282","authors":["Webster, Lynn","Henningfield, Jack","Buchhalter, August R.","Siddhanti, Suresh","Lu, Lin","Odinecs, Aleksandrs","Di Fonzo, Carlo J.","Eldon, Michael A."],"doi":"10.1093\/pm\/pnw344","first_seen_on":"2017-03-20T11:33:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-2375","1526-4637"],"journal":"Pain Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1500383170,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/painmedicine\/article\/3065794\/Human-Abuse-Potential-of-the-New-Opioid-Analgesic","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/painmedicine\/article\/3065794\/Human-Abuse-Potential-of-the-New-Opioid-Analgesic?searchresult=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/pm\/pnw344"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/painmedicine\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/pm\/pnw344\/10909365\/pnw344.pdf","pmid":"28340145","pubdate":"2017-03-26T22:01:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Human Abuse Potential of the New Opioid Analgesic Molecule NKTR-181 Compared with Oxycodone","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/painmedicine\/article\/3065794\/Human","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-abuse-potential-new-opioid-analgesic-molecule-nktr181-compared-oxycodone"},"altmetric_score":{"score":498.85,"score_history":{"1y":498.85,"6m":498.85,"3m":402.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":498.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229472,"mean":6.9710874477773,"rank":8010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8221466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229472,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241161,"mean":13.45443581025,"rank":773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":240388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241161,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1424,"mean":8.0480955727337,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":1421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1424,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":9.3878787878788,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"NKTR-181 Meets Primary and Secondary Endpoints in Phase 3 SUMMIT-07 Study in Chronic Pain","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29957522709&p=1pl&v=1&x=nAkvgudCPz9d9JPqpDmPxA","license":"public","citation_ids":[17829587],"posted_on":"2017-03-20T11:32:13+00:00","summary":"\/PRNewswire\/ -- Nektar Therapeutics (Nasdaq: NKTR) today announced positive results from the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study of NKTR-181, a first-in-class opioid analgesic.","author":{"name":"Ticker Tech","url":"http:\/\/www.tickertech.com","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/724\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-01-26_at_15.37.40.png?1453822700"}},{"title":"NKTR-181 Meets Primary and Secondary Endpoints in Phase 3 SUMMIT-07 Study in Chronic Pain","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29957539752&p=1pl&v=1&x=i9URO2Rs3qeFl_qoGUqXtA","license":"public","citation_ids":[17829587],"posted_on":"2017-03-20T11:30:00+00:00","summary":"\/PRNewswire\/ -- Nektar Therapeutics (Nasdaq:NKTR) today announced positive results from the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study of NKTR-181, a first-in-class opioid analgesic.","author":{"name":"NASDAQ","url":"http:\/\/www.nasdaq.com","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/839\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-01-27_at_11.14.52.png?1453893369"}},{"title":"NKTR-181 Meets Primary and Secondary Endpoints in Phase 3 SUMMIT-07 Study in Chronic Pain","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29957592356&p=1pl&v=1&x=qtMmnaGQw53J3bo2saDwmw","license":"public","citation_ids":[17829587],"posted_on":"2017-03-20T11:30:00+00:00","summary":"\/PRNewswire\/ -- Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) today announced positive results from the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study of NKTR-181, a first-in-class opioid analgesic.","author":{"name":"Yahoo!
