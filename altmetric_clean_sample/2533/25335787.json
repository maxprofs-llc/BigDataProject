Performance was evaluated with benchtop and 7 T MRI experiments.\nMonitored amplitude and phase were stable across repetitions and had standard deviations of 0.061\u2009\u03bcT and 0.0073 rad, respectively. The feedback system allowed inter-channel phase and B1 amplitude to be adjusted within two iterations. MRI experiments demonstrated the feasibility of this approach to perform safe and accurate multi-channel RF transmission and monitoring at high field.\nWe demonstrated a 4-channel transceiver system based on optically controlled on-coil amplifiers with RF signal monitoring and feedback control. The approach allows the safe and precise control of RF transmission fields, required to achieve uniform excitation at high field.
