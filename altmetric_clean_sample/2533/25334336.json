Recent studies have shown that vasopressin V1a and V1b receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system and are capable of influencing a wide variety of brain functions such as social behavior, emotionality, and learning and memory.\nThe present study was designed to examine the possible involvement of V1a and V1b receptors in THC-induced catalepsy-like immobilization.\nThe induction of catalepsy following treatment with THC (10\u00a0mg\/kg, i.p.) or haloperidol (1\u00a0mg\/kg, i.p.) was evaluated in wild-type (WT), V1a receptor knockout (V1aRKO), and V1b receptor knockout (V1bRKO) mice. The effect of treatment with the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (0.1\u00a0mg\/kg, i.p.) on THC-induced catalepsy was also evaluated in V1aRKO mice. Moreover, the effects of the V1a receptor antagonist VMAX-357 and the V1b receptor antagonist ORG-52186 on THC-induced catalepsy were evaluated in ddY mice.\nTHC and haloperidol markedly caused catalepsy in V1bRKO mice as well as in WT mice. However, V1aRKO mice exhibited a reduction in catalepsy induced by THC but not by haloperidol. WAY100635 dramatically enhanced THC-induced catalepsy in V1aRKO mice. Although VMAX-357 (10\u00a0mg\/kg, p.o.) but not ORG-52186 significantly attenuated THC-induced catalepsy, it had no significant effect on the enhancement of THC-induced catalepsy by WAY100635 in ddY mice.\nThese findings suggest that V1a receptor regulates THC-induced catalepsy-like immobilization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033ea","authors":["Nobuaki Egashira","Emi Koushi","Takayuki Myose","Akito Tanoue","Kenichi Mishima","Ryota Tsuchihashi","Junei Kinjo","Hiroyuki Tanaka","Satoshi Morimoto","Katsunori Iwasaki"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00213-017-4735-1","first_seen_on":"2017-09-15T13:00:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0033-3158","1432-2072"],"journal":"Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1505480403,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28905207?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28905207","pubdate":"2017-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology"],"title":"Role of vasopressin V1a receptor in \u22069-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced cataleptic immobilization in mice","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418954,"mean":7.0848786337124,"rank":7275611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418954,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128511,"mean":11.755666983114,"rank":104435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128511,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3059,"mean":6.6746265533028,"rank":2647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3059,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.452380952381,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlameOxytocin\/statuses\/908676788628348928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25334336],"posted_on":"2017-09-15T13:00:03+00:00","author":{"name":"The Love Hormone","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/647614031289708544\/4CuoFMsx_normal.png","description":"RSS feed of oxytocin and vasopressin papers in PubMed.
