Belatacept, the only costimulation blocker approved in organ transplant recipients, has not replaced the 30-plus-year-old CNIs as the mainstay of immunosuppression and is currently used infrequently. Modulating pathogenic immune responses through the interruption of costimulatory signals, which a na\u00efve T cell requires for its full activation, has captivated immunologists since the demonstration that such costimulation blockade leads to antigen-specific immunomodulation (at least in vitro). CD28 was identified as a key T cell costimulatory receptor and its blockade became a primary goal. Direct blockade of the CD28 receptor has been challenging (as conventional anti-CD28 antibodies typically retain some stimulating activity) and thus indirect blockade via ligation of the ligands CD80 and CD86 (B7-1 and B7-2) through CTLA4-Ig fusion proteins was developed as alternative.
