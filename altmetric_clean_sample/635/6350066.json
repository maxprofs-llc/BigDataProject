The aim of this prospective survey was to investigate if the sonication followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can improve bacterial identification on the surfaces of prefabricated spacers and if the systemic laboratory mediators of infection and positive microbiological results can take a role of predictive factors of infection and clinical failures in 2-years follow-up.\nThirteen patients with prosthetic joint infection were investigated. Bacterial culture and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing were used to detect bacteria on the surface of prefabricated spacers removed during the second stage of revision arthroplasty. The results of pre- and intraoperative culture and DNA sequencing were compared. Minimum follow-up was 2\u00a0years.\nThe result of tissue cultures in second-stage revision arthroplasties revealed positive results in 15\u00a0% of patients with Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) growth. Bacterial DNA was found in over 90\u00a0% of patients with negative synovial fluid culture. Positive PCR results revealed potential pathogenic bacteria and species of human and environmental microflora with low virulence. Clinical failures at final follow-up were recorded in 2 (16.6\u00a0%) patients.\nThe lack of clinical signs of infection, negative culture of preoperative joint aspirate, and intraoperative specimens do not exclude the presence of bacteria on the surfaces of spacers. The positive results of sonication and molecular tests should be interpreted as real pathogenicity factors in the light of the clinical and laboratory data, especially for patients with immunodeficiency. We confirmed our previous results that sonication followed by PCR and sequencing improved bacterial identification.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Bereza, Przemys\u0142aw","Ekiel, Alicja","Augu\u015bciak-Duma, Aleksandra","Aptekorz, Ma\u0142gorzata","Wilk, Iwona","Kusz, Damian","Wojciechowski, Piotr","Siero\u0144, Aleksander L","Martirosian, Gayane"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12891-016-0991-1","first_seen_on":"2016-03-27T10:23:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1459074186,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27015812?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27015812","pubdate":"2016-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rehabilitation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"Comparison of cultures and 16S rRNA sequencing for identification of bacteria in two-stage revision arthroplasties: preliminary report","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-cultures-16s-rrna-sequencing-identification-bacteria-twostage-revision-arthroplasties-pre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7446125,"mean":6.4725723772484,"rank":5634989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":996519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7446125,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275589,"mean":11.043488794867,"rank":193592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275589,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1968,"mean":4.6947178444331,"rank":1556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1968,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":3.8441590909091,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":11,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/biofilmPapers\/statuses\/714035006675365888","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6350066],"posted_on":"2016-03-27T10:23:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Biofilm Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585213267288653824\/evf5BSKg_normal.jpg","description":"Stay on top of all the latest publications on Biofilm research curated from PubMed. #biofilm #microbiology #antibioticresistance.
