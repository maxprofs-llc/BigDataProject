We investigated two groups the lower respiratory infection incidence, length of hospital stay for the surgery, postoperative complications, and rate of cannula withdrawal, by reviewing medical records.\nBoth the SCL and the tracheoesophageal diversion group showed a reduction in the incidence of infection after surgery, indicating that the efficacy of SCL was equivalent to that of tracheoesophageal diversion in preventing aspiration pneumonea. The SCL group showed a reduction in the length of hospital stay and an increased rate of cannula withdrawal as compared with the tracheoesophageal diversion group.\nThe efficacy of SCL was equivalent to that of tracheoesophageal diversion in preventing aspiration for SMID. We consider SLC to have potential for reducing the burden on patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000ccef","authors":["Oshima, Sakiko","Ochiai, Yukikatsu","Ariga, Masamichi","Hayakawa, Mika","Kanno, Masami","Takeuchi, Chisen","Saigusa, Hideto","Imai, Masayuki","Hamano, Shin-ichiro"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-27T10:22:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0029-0831"],"issue":"1","journal":"No to hattatsu Brain and development","last_mentioned_on":1459074141,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27012105?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27012105","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain","pediatrics"],"title":"[Safety and efficacy of surgical closure of the larynx for recurrent aspiration pneumonia in persons with severe motor and intellectual disabilities: a comparative study with tracheoesophageal diversion].","type":"article","volume":"48"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7446125,"mean":6.4725723772484,"rank":6449694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7446125,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275590,"mean":11.043455979738,"rank":233092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275590,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":0.85548780487805,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.61904761904762,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedNeurBriefs\/statuses\/714034817877147648","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6350061],"posted_on":"2016-03-27T10:22:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Ped Neurology Briefs","url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricneurologybriefs.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763925960097800192\/QpZJcQcD_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric Neurology Briefs (PNB) is the leading journal review focusing on child neurology since 1987. #OpenAccess on #PubMed & #PubMedCentral.","id_on_source":"PedNeurBriefs","tweeter_id":"759957720","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":2022},"tweet_id":"714034817877147648"}]}}
