It further investigated whether single-sex testing environments and stereotype threat influenced participants to believe that their ability was fixed (fixed mindset) rather than a trait that could be developed (growth mindset).\nOne hundred and forty-four female participants were assigned randomly to a self-as-target or group-as-target stereotype threat condition or to a control condition. They completed a modular arithmetic maths test and a mindset questionnaire either alone or in same-sex groups of 3-5 individuals.\nParticipants solved fewer mathematical problems under self-as-target and group-as-target stereotype threat when they were tested alone, but these performance deficits were eliminated when they were tested in single-sex groups. Participants reported a weaker growth mindset when they were tested under stereotype threat and in single-sex groups. Moreover, evidence of inconsistent mediation indicated that single-sex testing environments negatively predicted mindset but positively predicted mathematical performance.\nThese findings suggest that single-sex testing environments may represent a practical intervention to alleviate stereotype threat effects but may have a paradoxical effect on mindset.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002444","authors":["Pennington, Charlotte R.","Heim, Derek"],"doi":"10.1111\/bjep.12110","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-03-28T10:08:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2044-8279"],"issue":"3","journal":"British Journal of Educational Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1459929947,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/bjep.12110&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjep.12110\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/bjep.12110\/pdf","pmid":"27017194","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["education","psychology"],"title":"Creating a critical mass eliminates the effects of stereotype threat on women's mathematical performance","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/creating-critical-mass-eliminates-effects-stereotype-threat-womens-mathematical-performance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461538,"mean":7.1087657651241,"rank":1085517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7373883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461538,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282602,"mean":11.285111616731,"rank":50637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":231844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282602,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":401,"mean":5.70629,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":401,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":4.68125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"practitioner":5,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
