The relation of intestinal parasite treatment and efficacy of oral iodized oil was examined in an intervention study in 8-10-y-old schoolchildren in Malawi. Severely iodine-deficient schoolchildren with a single parasitic infestation of Ascaris lumbricoides (n = 44), hookworm (n = 42), or Entamoeba histolytica (n = 24) were randomly allocated to receive or not receive treatment before taking a 1-mL oral supplement (490 mg I) of iodized ethyl esters from poppy seed oil. The urinary iodine concentration was measured at various time points after supplementation to define the time intervals before urinary iodine concentrations returned to 0.40 mumol\/L, indicating moderate iodine deficiency. Treatment with metronidazole for E. histolytica increased the protection period from 2.0 to 21.0 wk (P < 0.05). For all untreated children together, the duration of effect was 9.2 wk shorter (P < 0.001) than that for their treated peers (16.8 wk). We conclude that intestinal parasitic infestations reduce the efficacy of oral supplementation with iodized ethyl esters by interfering with absorption.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["Furn\u00e9e, C A","West, C E","van der Haar, F","Hautvast, J G"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-28T05:16:40+00:00","issns":["0002-9165"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1459112226,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9394695"],"pmid":"9394695","pubdate":"1997-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Effect of intestinal parasite treatment on the efficacy of oral iodized oil for correcting iodine deficiency in schoolchildren.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-intestinal-parasite-treatment-efficacy-oral-iodized-oil-correcting-iodine-deficiency-schoolch"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7446125,"mean":6.4725723772484,"rank":6449726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7446125,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275364,"mean":10.985901758769,"rank":232850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275364,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5629,"mean":24.306572850036,"rank":5286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":47.756712871287,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
