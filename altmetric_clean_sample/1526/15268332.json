The aetiology of the disease is not well understood; it is viewed currently as a multifactorial disease which results from complex interactions between genetic predisposition and environmental factors, of which a few are potentially modifiable. Improving our understanding of these factors can lead to new and more effective approaches to patient counselling and, possibly, prevention and management of the disease. The 2016 focused workshop of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) addressed the topic of environmental, modifiable risk factors for MS, gathering experts from around the world, to collate experimental and clinical research into environmental factors that have been associated with the disease onset and, in a few cases, disease activity and progression. A number of factors, including infections, vitamin D deficiency, diet and lifestyle factors, stress and comorbidities, were discussed. The meeting provided a forum to analyse available evidence, to identify inconsistencies and gaps in current knowledge and to suggest avenues for future research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000312e","authors":["Maria Pia Amato","Tobias Derfuss","Bernard Hemmer","Roland Liblau","Xavier Montalban","Per Soelberg S\u00f8rensen","David H Miller","For the 2016 ECTRIMS Focused Workshop Group","Lars Alfredsson","Francesca Aloisi","Alberto Ascherio","Elisa Baldin","Kjetil Bj\u00f8rnevik","Manuel Comabella","Jorge Correale","Marianna Cortese","Marie D\u2019Hooghe","Angelo Ghezzi","Julian Gold","Kerstin Hellwig","Bernhard Hemmer","Nils Koch-Henricksen","Annette Langer Gould","Ralf Linker","Francesco Lolli","Robyn Lucas","Jan L\u00fcnemann","Melinda Magyari","Luca Massacesi","Ariel Miller","Philippe Monteyne","Ellen Mowry","Christian M\u00fcnz","Nete M Nielsen","Tomas Olsson","Celia Oreja-Guevara","Susana Otero","Maura Pugliatti","Stephen Reingold","Trond Riise","Neil Robertson","Marco Salvetti","Youssef Sidhom","Joost Smolders","Ludvig Sollid","Israel Steiner","Egon Stenager","Peter Sundstrom","Bruce V Taylor","Helen Tremlett","Maria Trojano","Antonio Uccelli","Emmanuelle Waubant","Hartmut Wekerle"],"doi":"10.1177\/1352458516686847","first_seen_on":"2017-01-06T15:23:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1352-4585","1477-0970"],"journal":"Multiple Sclerosis (13524585)","last_mentioned_on":1499814495,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1352458516686847#.WG-0pcOJNpQ.twitter","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/1352458516686847","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28671487?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/1352458516686847","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/1352458516686847?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub=pubmed&#articleCitationDownloadContainer"],"pmid":"28671487","pubdate":"2017-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"135245851668684","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Environmental modifiable risk factors for multiple sclerosis: Report from the 2016 ECTRIMS focused workshop","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/environmental-modifiable-risk-factors-multiple-sclerosis-report-2016-ectrims-focused-workshop"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.3,"score_history":{"1y":9.3,"6m":3.25,"3m":3.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8193064,"mean":6.9264840328884,"rank":904810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7287011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8193064,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263514,"mean":12.550477373032,"rank":44734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":218667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263514,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1851,"mean":5.8892908108108,"rank":384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":1467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1851,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":13.823673469388,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
