Phcog Mag"],"citation":{"abstract":"The androgen comprises a group of hormones that play roles in male reproductive activity as well as personal characteristics.\nWe investigated the androgenic activity of various herbal medicines in human prostate cancer 22Rv1 cells.\nHerbal extracts of Trichosanthes kirilowii (TK), Asarum sieboldii (AS), Sanguisorba officinalis (SO), and Xanthium strumarium (XS) were selected to have androgenic effects based on a preliminary in vitro screening system.\nTK, AS, SO, and XS enhanced the proliferation of 22Rv1 cells without having cytotoxic effects. All tested herbal extracts increased androgen receptor (AR)-induced transcriptional activity in the absence or presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In an AR-binding assay, TK, but not AS, SO, or XS, produced a significant inhibition of AR binding activity, indicating it has androgenic activity. Additionally, TK treatment positively regulated mRNA expression of the AR-related molecular targets prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and kallikrein 2 (KLK2) compared with untreated control.\nTaken together, TK-enhanced AR-mediated transcriptional activity might be an attractive candidate drug for treating androgen-related diseases.\nTrichosantheskirilowii (TK), Asarumsieboldii (AS), Sanguisorbaofficinalis (SO), and Xanthium strumarium (XS) enhanced the proliferation of 22Rv1 cells without having cytotoxic effects.TK, AS, SO, and XS increased androgen receptor (AR)-induced transcriptional activity.TK, but not AS, SO, or XS, produced a significant inhibition against AR-binding activity.TK treatment positively regulated mRNA expression of the AR-related molecular targets prostate-specific antigen and kallikrein 2.
