Because most studies concentrated on the urinary signals, we aimed to determine the saliva proteome in wild Mus musculus musculus, to extend the knowledge on potential roles of saliva in chemical communication. We performed the gel-free quantitative LC-MS\/MS analyses of saliva and identified 633 proteins with 134 (21%) of them being sexually dimorphic. They include proteins that protect and transport volatile organic compounds in their beta barrel including LCN lipocalins, major urinary proteins (MUPs), and odorant binding proteins (OBPs). To our surprise, the saliva proteome contains one MUP that is female biased (MUP8) and the two protein pheromones MUP20 (or 'Darcin') and ESP1 in individuals of both sex. Thus, contrary to previous assumptions, our findings reveal that these proteins cannot function as male-unique signals. Our study also demonstrates that many olfactory proteins (e.g. LCNs, and OBPs) are not expressed by submandibular glands but are produced elsewhere-in nasal and lacrimal tissues, and potentially also in other oro-facial glands. We have also detected abundant proteins that are involved in wound healing, immune and non-immune responses to pathogens, thus corroborating that saliva has important protective roles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Pavel Stopka","Barbora Kuntov\u00e1","Petr Klempt","Leona Havrdov\u00e1","Martina \u010cern\u00e1","Romana Stopkov\u00e1"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep32481","first_seen_on":"2017-01-06T13:18:05+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1484472314,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep32481"],"pmid":"27577013","pubdate":"2016-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Ecological genetics","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"32481","subjects":["science"],"title":"On the saliva proteome of the Eastern European house mouse (Mus musculus musculus) focusing on sexual signalling and immunity","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/saliva-proteome-eastern-european-house-mouse-mus-musculus-musculus-focusing-sexual-signalling-immuni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8071125,"mean":6.8533209909723,"rank":3589115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4393002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8071125,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256246,"mean":12.658461870475,"rank":113610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":138385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256246,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32902,"mean":14.920398407343,"rank":15069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":17481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32902,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3255,"mean":16.164713583282,"rank":1634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":1572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3255,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
