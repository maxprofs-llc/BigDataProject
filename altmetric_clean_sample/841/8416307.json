Since nitrate is one of the essential nitrogen components and more thermodynamically favorable electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration, nitrate-based bioremediation has been applied to aromatic-contaminated sediments. However, few studies have been focused on the response of aromatic-degrading microbial communities to nitrate addition in anaerobic sediments. Here we hypothesized that high nitrate inputs into the sediment would stimulate aromatic-degrading microbial communities and their associated degrading processes, thus increasing the bioremediation efficiency in aromatic compound-contaminated sediments. We analyzed the changes of key aromatic-degrading genes in the sediment samples from a field-scale site for in-situ bioremediation of aromatic-contaminated creek in the Pearl River Delta before and after nitrate injection using a functional gene array. Our results showed that the genes involved in the degradation of several kinds of aromatic compounds were significantly enriched after nitrate injection, especially those encoding enzymes for central catabolic pathways of aromatic compound degradation, and most of enriched genes were derived from nitrate-reducing microorganisms, possibly accelerating bioremediation of aromatic-contaminated sediments. The sediment nitrate concentration was found to be the predominant factor shaping the aromatic-degrading microbial communities. This study provides new insights into our understanding of the influences of nitrate addition on aromatic-degrading microbial communities in sediments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Xu, Meiying","He, Zhili","Zhang, Qin","Liu, Jin","Guo, Jun","Sun, Guoping","Zhou, Jizhong"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.est.5b03442","endpage":"12431","first_seen_on":"2016-06-01T10:56:17+00:00","issns":["1520-5851","0013-936X"],"issue":"20","journal":"Environmental Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1464775988,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26390227?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26390227","pubdate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"12422","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Responses of Aromatic-Degrading Microbial Communities to Elevated Nitrate in Sediments","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/responses-aromaticdegrading-microbial-communities-elevated-nitrate-sediments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7842728,"mean":6.6456077751988,"rank":6792741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7842728,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269347,"mean":11.365231984139,"rank":224394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269347,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8936,"mean":9.676685394516,"rank":8513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8936,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232,"mean":16.797073593074,"rank":223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
