BDs are chromatin 'readers': by interacting with acetylated lysines on the histone tails, they recruit chromatin-regulating proteins on the promoter region to regulate gene expression and repression. Extensive efforts have been employed by scientific communities worldwide to identify and develop potential inhibitors of BET family BDs to regulate protein expression by inhibiting acetylated histone (H3\/H4) interactions. Several small molecule inhibitors have been reported, which not only have high affinity but also have high specificity to BET BDs. These developments make BET family proteins an important therapeutic targets for major diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, obesity and inflammation. Here, we review and discuss the structural biology of BET family BDs and their applications in major diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f89","authors":["Padmanabhan, Balasundaram","Mathur, Shruti","Manjula, Ramu","Tripathi, Shailesh"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-01T12:37:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0973-7138"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Biosciences","last_mentioned_on":1464784376,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27240990?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27240990","pubdate":"2016-06-01T22:01:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","biochemistry"],"title":"Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family proteins: New therapeutic targets in major diseases.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bromodomain-extraterminal-bet-family-proteins-new-therapeutic-targets-major-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7842728,"mean":6.6456077751988,"rank":6792741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7842728,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269346,"mean":11.365207908073,"rank":224396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269346,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":386,"mean":2.3108987012987,"rank":285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":386,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.4542857142857,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
