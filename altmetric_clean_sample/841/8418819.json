As an emerging technology, a vision-based approach allows for remote measuring and does not bring any additional mass to the measuring object compared with traditional contact measurements. In this study, a high-speed vision-based sensor system is developed to extract structure vibration signals in real time. A fast motion extraction algorithm is required for this system because the maximum sampling frequency of the charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor can reach up to 1000 Hz. Two efficient subpixel level motion extraction algorithms, namely the modified Taylor approximation refinement algorithm and the localization refinement algorithm, are integrated into the proposed vision sensor. Quantitative analysis shows that both of the two modified algorithms are at least five times faster than conventional upsampled cross-correlation approaches and achieve satisfactory error performance. The practicability of the developed sensor is evaluated by an experiment in a laboratory environment and a field test. Experimental results indicate that the developed high-speed vision-based sensor system can extract accurate dynamic structure vibration signals by tracking either artificial targets or natural features.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Dashan Zhang","Jie Guo","Xiujun Lei","Changan Zhu"],"doi":"10.3390\/s16040572","first_seen_on":"2016-06-01T12:51:01+00:00","issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"4","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1464785441,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4851086\/"],"pmid":"27110784","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"572","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"A High-Speed Vision-Based Sensor for Dynamic Vibration Analysis Using Fast Motion Extraction Algorithms","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highspeed-visionbased-sensor-dynamic-vibration-analysis-using-fast-motion-extraction-algorithms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7842728,"mean":6.6456077751988,"rank":5948242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1050051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7842728,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269347,"mean":11.365160700363,"rank":188150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269347,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3243,"mean":1.8363429981493,"rank":1675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3243,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":1.6559565217391,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
