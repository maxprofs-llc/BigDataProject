A specially trained Community Resource Coordinator was assigned to each family in the intervention group. We hypothesized that children with severe, moderate, and complicated mild traumatic brain injury who received the intervention would have significantly better functional outcomes at 6 months post discharge than those who received standard care. We further hypothesized that there would be a direct correlation between patient outcome and measures of family function.\nThe primary outcome measure was a composite measured at 6 months post injury. There were 308 patients included in the study (61% men). Forty-four percent sustained a complicated mild traumatic brain injury, 18% moderate, and 38% severe. Sixty-five percent of the patients were 8 years old or younger, and over 70% were transported to the hospital without ambulance assistance. There was no significant difference between groups on the primary outcome measure. There was a statistically significant correlation between the primary outcome measure and the scores on the Family Impact Module of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (\u03c1 = 0.57; p < 0.0001). Children with better outcomes lived with families reporting better function at 6 months post injury.\nAlthough no significant effect of the intervention was demonstrated, this study represents the first conducted in Latin America that documents the complete course of treatment for pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury spanning hospital transport through hospital care and into the postdischarge setting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008484","authors":["Carney, Nancy A.","Petroni, Gustavo J.","Luj\u00e1n, Silvia B.","Ballarini, Nicol\u00e1s M.","Faguaga, Gabriela A.","du Coudray, Hugo E.
