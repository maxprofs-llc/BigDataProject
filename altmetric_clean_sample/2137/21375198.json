The prevalence of current AR symptoms (subjects presenting clinical symptoms of AR in the past 12 months, but had yet to be diagnosed by physician) increased significantly from 14.9% to 23.5% (p<0.001). There was no significant change in the prevalence of physician-diagnosed AR (11.6-11.2%). In multivariate analysis, gender (OR 0.733; CI 0.642-0.931), a family history of atopy (OR 2.017; CI 1.669-2.436), frequent upper respiratory tract infections (OR 2.033; CI 1.659-2.492), long-lasting disease before the appearance of the allergy (OR 2.119; CI 1.311-3.428), feather bedding (OR 0.773; CI 0.599-0.996) and living in a green area (OR 1.367; CI 1.133-1.650) were found to be significant risk factors of cumulative AR in 2013. In both of the groups with (p<0.000) or without (p<0.003) AR the families with a history of atopy used feather bedding less frequently than families without atopy.\nAlthough the prevalence of physician-diagnosed AR has not shown significant changes during the studied interval, the significant increase of the current AR symptoms suggests growing prevalence of AR among children in Budapest. Our results revealed new aspects of bedding customs in atopic families.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006949","authors":["Sult\u00e9sz, M.","Balogh, I.","Katona, G.","Mezei, G.","Hirschberg, A.","G\u00e1lffy, G."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aller.2017.02.010","first_seen_on":"2017-06-27T16:20:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0301-0546","03010546"],"journal":"Allergologia et Immunopathologia","last_mentioned_on":1498580400,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0301054617300708?utm_content=buffer114ea&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"28629670","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Trends in prevalence and risk factors of allergic rhinitis symptoms in primary schoolchildren six years apart in Budapest","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trends-prevalence-risk-factors-allergic-rhinitis-symptoms-primary-schoolchildren-six-years-apart-bud"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236552,"mean":12.965668578869,"rank":193979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236552,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":2.3813180661578,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.1592857142857,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AirmidHealth\/statuses\/879736079145984000","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21375198],"posted_on":"2017-06-27T16:20:00+00:00","author":{"name":"airmid healthgroup","url":"http:\/\/www.airmidhealthgroup.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/846394640332918784\/LtDfIlwT_normal.jpg","description":"Research & testing lab.
