Protocols depending on the violation of a Bell inequality, for instance, may be subject to the so-called detection loophole: Imperfect detectors may yield spurious violations, which consequently cannot be used to ensure, say, quantum cryptographic security. Hence, we investigate the possibility of giving lower bounds on detector efficiency even if an adversary has full control over both the source and the detectors. To this end, we present a technique to systematically derive Bell inequalities free from the detection loophole using only the observed measurements statistics. The violation of these inequalities certifies that the detectors used exceed a certain minimal efficiency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Jochen Szangolies","Hermann Kampermann","Dagmar Bru\u00df"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.118.260401","first_seen_on":"2017-06-27T18:01:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1079-7114"],"issue":"26","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1498586476,"links":["https:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.118.260401"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aps.org\/pdf\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.118.260401","pmid":"28707942","pubdate":"2017-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Device-Independent Bounds on Detection Efficiency","type":"article","volume":"118","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deviceindependent-bounds-detection-efficiency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236552,"mean":12.965641734763,"rank":193979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236552,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16679,"mean":11.277398249191,"rank":13748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16679,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":476,"mean":21.244517894737,"rank":338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":476,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
