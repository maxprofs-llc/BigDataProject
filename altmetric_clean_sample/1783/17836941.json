Height, weight, waist and hip circumference were measured, and serum samples taken for measurement of lipids and apolipoproteins. Survival analysis was used for conversion to MS and time to relapse, and linear regression for annualised change in disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale).\nHigher body mass index (BMI; adjusted HR (aHR): 1.22 (1.04 to 1.44) per 5 kg\/m(2) increase), hip circumference (aHR: 1.32 (1.12 to 1.56) per 10 cm increase) and triglyceride levels (aHR: 1.20 (1.03 to 1.40) per unit increase) were associated with increased risk of subsequent relapse, while adiposity and lipid-related measures were not associated with conversion to MS. In addition, higher BMI (\u03b2: 0.04 (0.01 to 0.07) per 5 kg\/m(2) increase), hip circumference (\u03b2: 0.04 (0.02 to 0.08) per 10 cm increase), waist circumference (\u03b2: 0.04 (0.02 to 0.07) per 10 cm increase), total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein ratio (TC\/HDL ratio; \u03b2: 0.05 (0.001 to 0.10) and non-HDL; \u03b2: 0.04 (0.001 to 0.08) at study entry) were associated with a higher subsequent annual change in disability.\nHigher levels of adiposity, non-HDL and TC\/HDL ratio were prospectively associated with a higher rate of disability progression, and higher adiposity and triglycerides were associated with relapse but not with conversion to MS. Improving the lipid profile and losing weight into the healthy range could reduce the accumulation of disability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037a5","authors":["Prudence Tettey","Steve Simpson","Bruce Taylor","Anne-Louise Ponsonby","Robyn M Lucas","Terence Dwyer","Karam Kostner","AUSLONG investigators group","Ingrid AF van der Mei"],"doi":"10.1136\/jnnp-2016-315037","first_seen_on":"2017-03-20T17:34:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1468-330X","0022-3050"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1498812512,"links":["http:\/\/jnnp.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2017\/03\/19\/jnnp-2016-315037?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jnnp.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2017\/03\/19\/jnnp-2016-315037?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/jnnp.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2017\/03\/19\/jnnp-2016-315037?rss=1&hootPostID=dc77aedba1ed22bc81d08a49d0746aa1","http:\/\/jnnp.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2017\/03\/19\/jnnp-2016-315037?rss=1","http:\/\/jnnp.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/jnnp-2016-315037v1?rss=1","http:\/\/jnnp.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2017\/03\/19\/jnnp-2016-315037","http:\/\/jnnp.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/jnnp-2016-315037v1?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/jnnp-2016-315037","http:\/\/jnnp.bmj.com\/content\/88\/5\/395?rss=1","http:\/\/jnnp.bmj.com\/content\/88\/5\/395","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28320766"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jnnp.bmj.com\/content\/jnnp\/early\/2017\/03\/19\/jnnp-2016-315037.full.pdf","pmid":"28320766","pubdate":"2017-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"jnnp-2016-315037","subjects":["psychiatry","neurosurgery","neurology"],"title":"An adverse lipid profile and increased levels of adiposity significantly predict clinical course after a first demyelinating event","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adverse-lipid-profile-increased-levels-adiposity-significantly-predict-clinical-course-after-first-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.1,"score_history":{"1y":16.1,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":549622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7895626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249545,"mean":13.399065150835,"rank":28730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":220765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249545,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4446,"mean":6.1181061867267,"rank":306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4446,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":8.5268275862069,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
