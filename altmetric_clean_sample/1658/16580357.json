Poor-quality shaving can cause a significant inflammatory response of the skin, which may consequently lead to skin irritation and soreness. This study aims to explore and quantify the forces that act upon the skin and hair during the shave and suggests that careful management of these forces is essential in optimizing the shaving process. Various razor features are discussed and their impact on the resulting biomechanical forces is considered. Recent data are included comparing a basic low-tier disposable razor with a more technologically advanced premium system razor and show significant differences in both subjective shave attribute scores and resulting blood flux in the skin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b38","authors":["Cowley, K.","Vanoosthuyze, K."],"doi":"10.1111\/ics.12330","endpage":"23","first_seen_on":"2017-02-21T16:13:44+00:00","issns":["01425463","1468-2494"],"issue":"S1","journal":"International Journal of Cosmetic Science","last_mentioned_on":1487687545,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ics.12330\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ics.12330\/pdf","pmid":"27212467","pubdate":"2016-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"17","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"The biomechanics of blade shaving","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/ics.12330","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomechanics-blade-shaving"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":8,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":1084753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7142601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242623,"mean":13.682835670302,"rank":49846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":192268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242623,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":4.2564985835694,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Zijn scheermesjes met meer messen echt beter?","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29661813742&p=1pl&v=1&x=fdHUtsAXtTLjvXkAW15Pzw","license":"public","citation_ids":[16580357],"posted_on":"2017-02-21T14:32:25+00:00","summary":"NRC Media Holding BV maakt gebruik van cookies en daarmee vergelijkbare technieken.","author":{"name":"NRC Handelsblad","url":"http:\/\/www.nrc.nl\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/447\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-02-02_at_11.28.03.png?1454412495"}}]}}
