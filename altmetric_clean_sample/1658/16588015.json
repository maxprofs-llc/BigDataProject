Detailed investigation of the instrument parameters and sample preparation are all shown to influence the spectra. Of these, the preanalysis sample preparation steps incorporate the most important elements influencing the quality and reproducibility of the spectra. Some of the most important sample preparation factors include the method employed for sterilization, the type of matrix, the matrix solvent and concentration of cells in the matrix, as well as the type and concentration of acid added to the matrix. The effects of these parameters, as well as other aspects of sample preparation and the effects of several instrumental parameters on spectra are presented. Optimization and control of all experimental variables leads to a stable protocol for analysis of bacteria. The protocol employs a Nd:Yag laser and describes both sample handling and instrument conditions which consistently yield reproducible MALDI TOF mass spectra with greater than 25 peaks from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5d","authors":["Tracie L.
