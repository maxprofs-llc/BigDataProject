The gating behaviour of CFTR is characterized by bursts of channel openings interrupted by brief, flickery closures, separated by long closures between bursts. Entry to and exit from an open burst is controlled by the interaction of ATP with two ATP-binding sites, sites 1 and 2 in CFTR. To understand better the kinetic basis of CFTR intraburst gating, we investigated the single-channel activity of human CFTR at different intracellular pH (pHi ) values. When compared with the control (pHi 7.3), acidifying pHi to 6.3 or alkalinizing pHi to 8.3 and 8.8 caused small reductions in the open-time constant \u03c4o of wild-type CFTR. By contrast, the fast closed-time constant \u03c4cf , which describes the short-lived closures that interrupt open bursts, was greatly increased at pHi 5.8 and 6.3. To analyse intraburst kinetics, we used linear three-state gating schemes. All data were satisfactorily modeled by the C1 \u2194 O \u2194 C2 kinetic scheme. Changing the intracellular ATP concentration was without effect on \u03c4o , \u03c4cf and their responses to pHi changes. However, mutations that disrupt the interaction of ATP with ATP-binding site 1, including K464A, D572N and the CF-associated mutation G1349D all abolished the prolongation of \u03c4cf at pHi 6.3. Taken together, our data suggest that the regulation of CFTR intraburst gating is distinct from the ATP-dependent mechanism that controls channel opening and closing. However, our data also suggest that ATP-binding site 1 modulates intraburst gating. This article is protected by copyright.
