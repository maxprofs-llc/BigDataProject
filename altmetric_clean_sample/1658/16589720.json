Surface salinity (2 to 8 PSU) and hence biodiversity is low. In the last century, annual nutrient loads increased to 10(6) metric tons N and 5 x 10(4) ton P. Eutrophication is evident in the N-limited south, where cyanobacteria fix 2 to 4 x 10(5) ton N each summer, Secchi depths have been halved, and O2-deficient bottom areas have spread. Production remains low in the P-limited north. In nutrient-enriched coastal areas, phytoplankton blooms, toxic at times, and filamentous macroalgae reduce amenity values. Loads need to be reduced of both N, to reduce production, and P, to limit N-fixing cyanobacterial blooms. When large N-load reductions have been achieved locally, algal biomass has declined. So far, P loads have been reduced more than N loads. If this continues, a P-limited Baltic proper may result, very different from previous N-limited conditions. Reaching the management goal of halved anthropogenic N and P loads at minimum cost will require better understanding of biogeochemical nutrient cycles, economic evaluation of proposed measures, and improved stakeholder participation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088c9","authors":["Elmgren, R.","Larsson, U."],"doi":"10.1100\/tsw.2001.291","first_seen_on":"2017-02-21T23:44:44+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1537-744X"],"journal":"The Scientific World Journal","last_mentioned_on":1325376000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1100\/tsw.2001.291"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/tswj\/2001\/319865.pdf","pmid":"12805876","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Nitrogen and the Baltic Sea: Managing Nitrogen in Relation to Phosphorus","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/tswj\/2001\/319865\/abs\/","volume":"1 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nitrogen-baltic-sea-managing-nitrogen-relation-phosphorus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7228318,"mean":6.3649889881663,"rank":1719114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4599477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7228318,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89163,"mean":12.595040600256,"rank":28930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":58478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89163,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1502,"mean":2.5025716189207,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":1191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1502,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.7,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
