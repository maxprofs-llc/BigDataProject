This approach can be sensitive to the dynamic interaction between biological predisposition and environmental influences, and is potentially more informative than an approach using static genetic code. Recent work in this field has generated considerable enthusiasm, yet caution is warranted since any novel cross-disciplinary approach lacks a set of established conventions or standards. In this paper we review existing research in the field of imaging epigenetics, outline important caveats and considerations, and suggest a set of guidelines for researchers conducting this work.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031aa","authors":["Lancaster, Katie","Morris, James P.","Connelly, Jessica J."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroscience.2017.08.004","first_seen_on":"2017-08-13T10:02:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0306-4522","1873-7544"],"journal":"Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1502641119,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28801185?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28801185?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28801185","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Neuroimaging Epigenetics: Challenges and Recommendations for Best Practices","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuroimaging-epigenetics-challenges-recommendations-best-practices"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":1.35,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":4154281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4147874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180200,"mean":12.425270284519,"rank":87569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":90716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180200,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3489,"mean":4.1159013761468,"rank":1757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3489,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":4.3281344537815,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
