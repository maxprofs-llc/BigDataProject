A total of 93 biological samples, including blood as well as normal and neoplastic tissue samples from 31 dogs with diagnosed malignant canine mammary tumours were analysed. DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing of the D-loop as well as bioinformatic and statistical analyses were performed. In the mitochondrial D-loop sequence, 26 polymorphic loci and 5 mutations were identified. For the first time, D-loop length heteroplasmy was detected in dogs with mammary tumours. The malignancy grade exerted no effect on the presence of nucleotide changes. A statistically significant association between the presence of mutations and polymorphisms and the size of dogs was demonstrated. The 100% frequency of length heteroplasmy may imply that this is a hotspot mutation of canine mammary tumour.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f6","authors":["Surdyka, M.","Slaska, B.","Surdyka, M","Slaska, B"],"doi":"10.1111\/vco.12224","first_seen_on":"2016-05-20T14:36:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1476-5829"],"journal":"Veterinary & Comparative Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1464101970,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vco.12224\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vco.12224\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vco.12224\/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/vco.12224","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vco.12224\/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vco.12224\/pdf","pmid":"27198058","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Defect of the mitochondrial DNA hypervariable region as a risk factor for canine mammary tumour","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/defect-mitochondrial-dna-hypervariable-region-risk-factor-canine-mammary-tumour"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7747098,"mean":6.6307251234818,"rank":5583612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1886600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7747098,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268811,"mean":11.461356177225,"rank":172599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268811,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":397,"mean":1.9304949494949,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":397,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.7019230769231,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet\/statuses\/733667605274300421","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8002599],"posted_on":"2016-05-20T14:36:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Oncologiavet","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/849456038709538817\/jJ9c5Y2Q_normal.jpg","description":"Francisco Alvarez Berger DVM MSc DACVIM (Oncology) - Veterinary oncology","id_on_source":"oncologiavet","tweeter_id":"167392151","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":4488},"tweet_id":"733667605274300421"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/733974639114915840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8002599],"posted_on":"2016-05-21T10:56:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2115},"tweet_id":"733974639114915840"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Defect of the mitochondrial DNA hypervariable region as a risk factor for canine mammary tumour...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=491182891076897&id=187782961416893","license":"public","citation_ids":[8002599,8002599,8002599],"posted_on":"2016-05-24T14:59:30+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vco.12224\/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=","author":{"name":"Institute of Canine Biology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/187782961416893","facebook_wall_name":"Institute of Canine Biology","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/187782961416893\/picture","id_on_source":"187782961416893"}}]}}
