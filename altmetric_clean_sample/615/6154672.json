The importance of immune cells to MS pathology is supported by clinical data linking the depletion of T and B cells, or the prevention of their migration into the brain with significant reduction in relapses and development of new lesions. In vitro studies, preclinical animal models and encouraging data with the anti-IL-17A antibody secukinumab in a small proof of concept study in man, indicate that IL-17A, a key interleukin associated with many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, may be involved in MS. Not only cells involved in adaptive immune responses such as Th17 cells and cytotoxic T cells, or innate immune responses such as mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and \u03b3\u03b4T cells, but also CNS resident cells such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes might contribute to the local production of IL-17A. IL-17A synergizes with other proinflammatory cytokines, by inducing the release of additional cytokines, mediators of tissue damage and chemokines, that recruit new inflammatory cells. IL-17A adversely affects the functions of microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, neural precursor cells and endothelial cells. Blockade of IL-17A might be beneficial to MS patients not only by inhibiting inflammation and tissue destruction, but also by enhancing repair processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002668","authors":["Kolbinger, Frank","Huppertz, Christine","Mir, Anis","Di Padova, Franco"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T18:46:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5592"],"journal":"Current Drug Targets","last_mentioned_on":1504175439,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26953244?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26953244?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26953244","pubdate":"2016-03-10T22:03:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"IL-17A and multiple sclerosis: signaling pathways, producing cells and target cells in the central nervous system.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/il17a-multiple-sclerosis-signaling-pathways-producing-cells-target-cells-central-nervous-system-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":6414612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285528,"mean":11.157241802001,"rank":202112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":42275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285528,"percentile":14},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":493,"mean":2.2597032520325,"rank":281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":493,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.2727272727273,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MltplSclppr\/statuses\/707885601857544192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6154672],"posted_on":"2016-03-10T11:07:34+00:00","author":{"name":"MS Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/599614030790008833\/7IuEjHC7_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"MltplSclppr","tweeter_id":"3262004991","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":212},"tweet_id":"707885601857544192"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/903203375050760192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6154672],"posted_on":"2017-08-31T10:30:39+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
