The primary aim was to analyze the effectiveness and safety of FCSEMS for drainage of different types of PFCs in a large cohort. The secondary aim was to investigate which type of FCSEMS is superior.\nThis was a retrospective, noncomparative review of a nationwide database involving all hospitals of Spain performing EUS-guided PFC drainage. From April 2008 to August 2013, all patients undergoing drainage of a PFC with an FCSEMS were included in a database. Main outcome measurements were technical success, short (2 weeks) and long-term (6 months) effectiveness, adverse events (AEs), and need for surgery.\nThe study included 211 patients (pseudocyst\/WOPN 53\/47%). FCSEMSs used were straight biliary (66%) or lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS, 34%). Technical success was achieved in 97% of cases (95% CI, 93%-99%). Short-term and long-term clinical success was obtained in 94% (95% CI, 89%-97%) and 85% of patients (95% CI, 79%-89%), respectively. AEs occurred in 21% of cases (95% CI, 16%-27%): infection (11%), bleeding (7%), stent migration and\/or perforation (3%). By multivariate analysis, patient age (>58 years old) and prior failed drainage were the most important factors associated with negative outcome.\n(1) FCSEMSs are effective and safe for PFC drainage. (2) Older patients with a history of unsuccessful drainage are more likely to fail EUS-guided drainage. (3) The type of FCSEMS does not appear to influence patient outcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058f7","authors":["Enrique Vazquez-Sequeiros","Todd H.
