The number of administered injections was recorded in the electronic device log. Adherence to treatment was defined as the administration of\u00a0\u226580\u00a0% of expected injections. Cognitive impairment and injection anxiety were assessed via questionnaires.\nOverall, 91.8 and 82.9\u00a0% of participants were adherent to treatment at weeks 12 and 24, respectively. By weeks 12 and 24, 8.2 and 13.9\u00a0% of participants had discontinued treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in adherence rates at weeks 12 and 24 according to cognitive impairment status or injection anxiety. By week 24, 69.9\u00a0% of participants were less fearful of injection than when they started the study. According to participant evaluations, the absence of a visible needle, comfort settings, and the calendar for tracking the injection schedule were all important features of the RebiSmart(\u00ae) injection system. At week 24, 99.3\u00a0% of participants reported that they would like to continue using RebiSmart(\u00ae) as their injector.\nRebiSmart(\u00ae) use is associated with high treatment adherence, as objectively assessed using electronic injection logs. Future research should examine if RebiSmart(\u00ae) use improves long-term treatment outcomes in RMS. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01128075, on May 20, 2010.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000798","authors":["Devonshire, Virginia A","Feinstein, Anthony","Moriarty, Patrick"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13104-016-1948-z","first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T18:44:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-0500"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Research Notes","last_mentioned_on":1457607979,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26951043?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26951043","pubdate":"2016-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Adherence to interferon \u03b2-1a therapy using an electronic self-injector in multiple sclerosis: a multicentre, single-arm, observational, phase IV study","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adherence-interferon-%CE%B21a-therapy-using-electronic-selfinjector-multiple-sclerosis-multicentre-single"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377175,"mean":6.4096998099772,"rank":6382010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377175,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278481,"mean":10.792162079862,"rank":235011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278481,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1874,"mean":4.5375589962627,"rank":1557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1874,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":12.739308411215,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
