The specificity of the recently revised criteria can be disappointing, justifying development of new clinical tools.\nWe produced a behavioral inventory named DAPHNE. This scale (adapted from Rascovsky's criteria) explores six domains: disinhibition, apathy, perseverations, hyperorality, personal neglect and loss of empathy. It is composed of ten items (five answer categories). The aim was (1) to assess the validity and reliability of DAPHNE and (2) to evaluate its contribution in differentiating patients.\nTwo scores were computed: DAPHNE-6 (screening) from the six domains and DAPHNE-40 (diagnosis) from the ten items. Reliability and reproducibility were assessed. External validity was studied with the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) and the Frontotemporal Behavioral Scale (FBS). Finally, the diagnostic performance of DAPHNE was compared to revised criteria, FBI and FBS.\nDAPHNE was administered to the caregivers of 89 patients, 36 with bvFTD, 22 with Alzheimer's disease, 15 with progressive supranuclear palsy and 16 with bipolar disorder. Reliability and reproducibility were excellent, as was external validity. DAPHNE-6 allowed bvFTD diagnosis (score \u22654) with a sensitivity of 92%, while DAPHNE-40 (score \u226515) had a specificity of 92%.\nWe demonstrate excellent psychometric features for DAPHNE. This quick tool could help for both diagnosing and screening bvFTD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbfc","authors":["Boutoleau-Bretonni\u00e8re, Claire","Evrard, Christelle","Hardouin, Jean Beno\u00eet","Rocher, La\u00ebtitia","Charriau, Tiphaine","Etcharry-Bouyx, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique","Auriacombe, Sophie","Richard-Mornas, Aur\u00e9lie","Lebert, Florence","Pasquier, Florence","Sauvaget, Anne","Bulteau, Samuel","Vercelletto, Martine","Derkinderen, Pascal","Bretonni\u00e8re, C\u00e9dric","Thomas-Ant\u00e9rion, Catherine","Boutoleau-Bretonni\u00e8re, C.","Evrard, C.","Hardouin, J.B.","Rocher, L.","Charriau, T.","Etcharry-Bouyx, F.","Auriacombe, S.","Richard-Mornas, A.","Lebert, F.","Pasquier, F.","Sauvaget, A.","Bulteau, S.","Vercelletto, M.","Derkinderen, P.","Bretonni\u00e8re, C.","Thomas-Ant\u00e9rion, C."],"doi":"10.1159\/000440859","endpage":"516","first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T19:13:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1664-5464"],"issue":"3","journal":"Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders EXTRA","last_mentioned_on":1457738149,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26955383?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26955383","http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/FullText\/440859"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/440859","pmid":"26955383","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","startpage":"503","title":"DAPHNE: A New Tool for the Assessment of the Behavioral Variant of Frontotemporal Dementia","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/daphne-new-tool-assessment-behavioral-variant-frontotemporal-dementia-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7380163,"mean":6.412201927,"rank":627548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6750811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7380163,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278495,"mean":10.793559013838,"rank":35609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":242740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278495,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":5.7278857142857,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":4.7,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
