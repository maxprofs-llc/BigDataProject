In addition to prevalence, a description in terms of serotypes and tetracycline (TET) resistance of the isolates is included. A total of 1725 feed and feed ingredients samples were analyzed during 2009 and 2014, from which 110 Salmonella strains were recovered (76 from poultry, 23 from meat and bone meal [MBM], 3 from pet foods, and 8 from other feed). Retrieved isolates were serotyped and tested for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against TET. Salmonella strains were found mainly from poultry feed (different growth stages, n\u2009=\u200976\/110; 69.1%) and MBM (n\u2009=\u200923\/109; 21.1%). The rest of the isolates were recovered from feather meal, pet food, fish meal (n\u2009=\u20093\/110; 2.3% each) and swine feed (n\u2009=\u20091\/110; 0.9%). From the different serotypes recovered (n\u2009=\u200921), the most common were Salmonella Give (n\u2009=\u200918; 13.8%) and Salmonella Rissen (n\u2009=\u20096; 4.6%) for MBM and Salmonella Havana (n\u2009=\u200914; 10.8%), Salmonella Rissen, Salmonella Soerenga, and Salmonella Schwarzengrund (n\u2009=\u20098; 6.2% each) in poultry feed. Recovered strains were regarded to be sensitive or have an intermediate resistance to TET as evidenced by their MIC50 and MIC90 concentrations of 4 and 8\u2009\u03bcg\/mL for MBM and poultry feed, respectively. Compound feed and MBM samples exhibited strains characterized by 86.8 and 88.9% of the isolates classified (according to CLSI, 2015 ) as sensitive, 7.7 and 3.7% as intermediate, and 5.5% (with >256\u2009\u03bcg\/mL as the highest concentration) and 7.4% (with 64\u2009\u03bcg\/mL as the highest concentration) as resistant to TET, respectively. Salmonella serovars Anatum and Havana exhibited the highest resistance profile >256 and 128\u2009\u03bcg\/mL, respectively. Hence, MBM and poultry feed seem to be a target of interest if Salmonella incidence is to be controlled. Serotypes recovered have in the past demonstrated pathogenic capability; therefore, hereafter a stricter surveillance program may be in order.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f61000746b","authors":["MolinaAndrea"],"doi":"10.1089\/fpd.2015.2050","endpage":"127","first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T20:33:26+00:00","issns":["1556-7125","1535-3141"],"issue":"3","journal":"Foodborne Pathogens & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1457615411,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/fpd.2015.2050"],"pmid":"26682678","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"119","subjects":["parasitology","microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"\n              Vigilance for\n              Salmonella\n              in Feedstuffs Available in Costa Rica: Prevalence, Serotyping and Tetracycline Resistance of Isolates Obtained from 2009 to 2014\n            ","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vigilance-salmonella-feedstuffs-available-costa-rica-prevalence-serotyping-tetracycline-resistance-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377175,"mean":6.4096998099772,"rank":5579289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377175,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278481,"mean":10.79221612324,"rank":195617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278481,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":452,"mean":2.5171796008869,"rank":270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":452,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.9904,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
