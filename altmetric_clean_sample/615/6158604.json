Emotional states can conveniently be induced by hypnosis-based suggestions. We studied brain electric activity during hypnotically induced anxiety and relaxation in 11 right-handed normals (5 males, 6 females, mean age 26.5+\/-7.6 years). After induction of light hypnosis, anxiety and then relaxation was suggested using a standardized text (reverse sequence in half of the subjects). Nineteen-channel, eyes-closed EEG (20 artifact-free s\/subject) was analyzed (source localization using FFT approximation and low resolution electromagnetic tomography, LORETA). Global tests revealed the strongest difference (P<0.005) between EEG source gravity center locations during the two emotional states in the excitatory beta-2 EEG frequency band (18.5-21 Hz). Post hoc tests showed that the sources were located more right during anxiety than during relaxation (P=0.01). LORETA specified that anxiety showed maximally stronger activity than relaxation in right Brodmann area 10, and relaxation showed maximally stronger activity than anxiety in left Brodmann area 22. Clearly, the two induced emotional states were associated with activity of different neural populations. Our results agree with reports on brain activity shifted to the right (especially fronto-temporal) during negative compared with positive emotions, and support the role of beta-2 EEG frequency in emotional states.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b92","authors":["Isotani, T","Tanaka, H","Lehmann, D","Pascual-Marqui, R D","Kochi, K","Saito, N","Yagyu, T","Kinoshita, T","Sasada, K"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0167-8760(00)00197-5","endpage":"153","first_seen_on":"2016-03-11T13:17:15+00:00","issns":["0167-8760","01678760"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Psychophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1457637667,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167876000001975"],"pmid":"11325459","pubdate":"2001-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"143","subjects":["psychophysiology"],"title":"Source localization of EEG activity during hypnotically induced anxiety and relaxation","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/source-localization-eeg-activity-during-hypnotically-induced-anxiety-relaxation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377337,"mean":6.4097701099652,"rank":3573816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":3617071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377337,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277973,"mean":10.829567236988,"rank":138905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":128608,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277973,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":697,"mean":4.0197586206897,"rank":321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":697,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":8.0884285714286,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
