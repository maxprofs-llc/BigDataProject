We evaluated the survival, number of copulations, fecundity and fertility of the adult females. The survival of females from these different pupal sizes did not differ statistically, but the survival of males from large pupae was statistically shorter than from small pupae. Fecundity differed significantly and correlated positively with size. The number of effective copulations (espematophores) and fertility did not vary significantly with pupal size. Our results emphasize the importance of indicating the number of copulations and the size of the insects when reproductive parameters are compared.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006cef","authors":["Specht, A","Montezano, D G","Sosa-G\u00f3mez, D R","Paula-Moraes, S V","Roque-Specht, V F","Barros, N M"],"doi":"10.1590\/1519-6984.23114","first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T18:39:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1678-4375"],"issue":"ahead","journal":"Brazilian Journal of Biology = Revista Brasileira de Biologia","last_mentioned_on":1457610147,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26959952?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26959952?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26959952","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Reproductive potential of Spodoptera eridania (Stoll) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in the laboratory: effect of multiple couples and the size","type":"article","volume":"76"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377175,"mean":6.4096998099772,"rank":3573798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":3617057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377175,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278482,"mean":10.792197119372,"rank":138959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":129015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278482,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":0.86666666666667,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.59375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lepido_papers\/statuses\/707884094206529536","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6154490],"posted_on":"2016-03-10T11:01:34+00:00","author":{"name":"lepidopapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558930683972685824\/x5EhqwSQ_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for papers on Lepidoptera from PubMed.
