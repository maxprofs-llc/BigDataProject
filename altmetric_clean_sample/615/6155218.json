Ninety percent of those developing hypothermia were male compared to 63% who remained normothermic (p = 0.006). Proportionally, more than twice as many hypothermic patients had a caudal block (43% versus 20%, p = 0.016) and received 121 ml more of fluid (p = 0.002) compared to the normothermic group. The patients who became hypothermic tended to be colder at induction of anaesthesia (36.6 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C versus 37.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C, p = < 0.0001) but there was no significant difference in the waiting time, time of induction, environmental temperatures or theatre temperatures compared to those not developing hypothermia. There was no significant difference in the BMI between the two groups (14.0 \u00b1 2.9 kg\/ m2 versus 15.2 \u00b1 3.5 kg\/m2, p = 0.101).\nThe incidence of intra-operative core hypothermia in paediatric patients undergoing general anaesthesia at the Kenyatta National Hospital is 30%. Gender (male), lower body temperature at induction, use of caudal block and the volume of intravenous fluids infused were significant independent predictors of core hypothermia. The most significant predictor was body temperature at the time of induction of general anaesthesia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9183cf058f61000d1d0","authors":["Kioko, P M","Olang, P","Mwangi, C","Chokwe, T"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T19:18:48+00:00","issns":["0012-835X"],"issue":"8","journal":"East African medical journal","last_mentioned_on":1457609530,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26866110?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26866110","pubdate":"2013-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"THE INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS FOR INTRA-OPERATIVE HYPOTHERMIA AMONG PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS UNDERGOING GENERAL ANAESTHESIA AT THE KENYATTA NATIONAL HOSPITAL.","type":"article","volume":"90"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377175,"mean":6.4096998099772,"rank":6382099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377175,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278482,"mean":10.792186167099,"rank":235046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278482,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":2.8244778761062,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/707891795892391936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6155218],"posted_on":"2016-03-10T11:32:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
