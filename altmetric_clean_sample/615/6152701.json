So far, the amount of drug deposited into the lung in these patients remains unknown. The aim of our pharmacokinetic study was to compare lung delivery of amikacin in the same subjects in two settings: spontaneously breathing through a tracheostomy and through the mouth.\nLung delivery was measured by amikacin urinary drug concentration in nine patients who were transitory tracheostomized for the need of a head and neck oncologic surgery. Patients performed two nebulization sessions: with a mouthpiece (MB) and through tracheostomy (TB) using a adapted jet nebulizer (Sidestream(\u00ae)).\nLung delivery was similar with the two conditions of nebulization (6.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5% vs. 6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0% of the nominal mass of amikacin, respectively, for MB and TB; p\u2009=\u20090.95). Duration of nebulization was also comparable (19.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 vs. 20.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u2009min, respectively, for mouth and tracheostomy breathing; p\u2009=\u20090.307). The half-life and elimination rate constant were not different between the two settings. We conclude that nebulized therapy can be administered in spontaneously breathing tracheostomized adults patients, with a similar amount of drug delivered to the lung compared with spontaneously mouth breathing patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c68","authors":["PitanceLaurent"],"doi":"10.1089\/jamp.2015.1245","first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T14:08:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1941-2703","1941-2711"],"journal":"Journal of Aerosol Medicine & Pulmonary Drug Delivery","last_mentioned_on":1457434140,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/jamp.2015.1245","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/jamp.2015.1245?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub=pubmed"],"pmid":"26907544","pubdate":"2016-02-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Influence of Tracheostomy on Lung Deposition in Spontaneously Breathing Patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-tracheostomy-lung-deposition-spontaneously-breathing-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7367623,"mean":6.4006371575483,"rank":6372349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7367623,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278395,"mean":10.789128831799,"rank":234723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278395,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":2.6974657534247,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.8285714285714,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1,"Professor":4},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Influence of Tracheostomy on Lung Deposition in Spontaneously Breathing Patients | Abstract","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=957938637594010&id=525011314220080","license":"public","citation_ids":[6152701,6152701],"posted_on":"2016-03-08T10:49:00+00:00","summary":"#nosprofspublient\nPitance, L., Reychler, G., Vecellio, L., Leal, T., Reychler, H., & Liistro, G.
