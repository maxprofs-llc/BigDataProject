Our latest paper."],"citation":{"abstract":"Flip-flops are a popular footwear choice in warm weather however their minimalist design offers little support to the foot.\nTo investigate the effect of flip-flops on lower limb gait kinematics in healthy adults, to measure adherence between the flip-flop and foot, and to assess the effect on toe clearance in swing.\nFifteen healthy adults (8 male, mean age 27\u00a0years) completed a three-dimensional gait analysis assessment using Codamotion. Kinematic and lower limb temporal-spatial data were captured using the Modified Helen Hayes marker set with additional markers on the hallux and flip-flop sole.\nCompared to barefoot walking, there were no differences in temporal-spatial parameters walking with flip-flops. There was an increase in peak knee flexion in swing (mean difference 4.6\u00b0, 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) [-5.8\u00b0, -3.4\u00b0], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and peak ankle dorsiflexion at terminal swing (mean difference 2\u00b0, 95\u00a0% CI [-3\u00b0, -1\u00b0], p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Other kinematic parameters were unchanged. Peak separation between foot and flip-flop was 8.8\u00a0cm (SD 1.48), occurring at pre-swing. Minimum toe clearance of the hallux in barefoot walking measured 4.2\u00a0cm (SD 0.8). Minimum clearance of the flip-flop was 1.6\u00a0cm (SD 0.56).\nHealthy adults adapted well to flip-flops. However, separation of the flip-flop from the foot led to increased knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion in swing, probably to ensure that the flip-flop did not contact the ground and to maximise adherence to the foot. Minimum clearance of the flip-flop was low compared to barefoot clearance. This may increase the risk of tripping over uneven ground.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a8e","authors":["T.
