A total of five different systems were prepared, and characterized by photon correlation spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and infrared spectroscopy. The SLN formulation showing optimal properties (lowest size and polydispersity index and highest zeta potential) was obtained with stearic acid and taurodeoxycholate as cosurfactant. This formulation was loaded with Calendula officinalis extract, a natural compound used on ophthalmic formulations given its anti-inflammatory, emollient, and wound repairing activity. Calendula-loaded SLN preparations were characterized in order to determine loading capacity and entrapment efficiency. In vitro cytotoxicity and wound healing efficacy of Calendula-loaded SLN compared to that of a free plant extract were evaluated on a conjunctival epithelium cell line WKD. Our results suggest that this SLN formulation is a safe and solvent-free Calendula extract delivery system which could provide a controlled therapeutic alternative for reducing disease-related symptoms and improving epithelium repair in ocular surface.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002593","authors":["Arana, Lide","Salado, Clarisa","Vega, Sandra","Aizpurua-Olaizola, Oier","Arada, Igor de la","Suarez, Tatiana","Usobiaga, Aresatz","Arrondo, Jos\u00e9 Luis R","Alonso, Alicia","Go\u00f1i, F\u00e9lix M","Alkorta, Itziar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.colsurfb.2015.07.020","endpage":"26","first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T22:40:21+00:00","issns":["1873-4367","09277765"],"journal":"Colloids & Surfaces B: Biointerfaces","last_mentioned_on":1475412592,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0927776515300540","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.colsurfb.2015.07.020"],"pmid":"26231862","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
