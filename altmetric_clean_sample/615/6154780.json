The endogenous intestinal microbiota was disrupted by the administration of multiple antibiotics, causing the loss of endogenous Bifidobacterium. Oral infection of these mice with MDRAb resulted in marked growth of this organism. Additional treatment of the infected mice with a sublethal dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) induced systemic invasion by MDRAb and subsequent animal death. The continuous oral administration of BbY increased the survival rate and inhibited the intestinal growth and invasion by MDRAb in the infection model. Disruptions of the intestinal environment and barrier function in the infected mice were attenuated by BbY. Protection against the MDRAb infection was markedly potentiated by a synbiotic combination of BbY and GOS, although GOS by itself did not provide protection. Negative correlations were observed between intestinal MDRAb and BbY counts or acetic acid levels; positive correlations were observed between acetic acid levels and intestinal epithelium expression of tight-junction-related genes.These results demonstrated that pro\/synbiotic markedly potentiated protection against fatal intestinal infection caused by a multidrug-resistant bacterium. Pro\/synbiotic are presumed to provide protection by compensation for the disrupted indigenous populations, thereby maintaining the intestinal environments and barrier functions otherwise targeted during opportunistic infection by MDRAb.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Asahara, Takashi","Takahashi, Akira","Yuki, Norikatsu","Kaji, Rumi","Takahashi, Takuya","Nomoto, Koji","Takashi Asahara","Akira Takahashi","Norikatsu Yuki","Rumi Kaji","Takuya Takahashi","Koji Nomoto"],"doi":"10.1128\/aac.02928-15","first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T18:51:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-6596","0066-4804"],"issue":"5","journal":"Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1461828428,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26953197?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/AAC.02928-15","http:\/\/aac.asm.org\/content\/60\/5\/3041.abstract?maxtoshow&hits=19&RESULTFORMAT&andorexacttitle=and&andorexacttitleabs=and&fulltext=MRSA&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&usestrictdates=yes&resourcetype=HWCIT&ct&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26953197","pubdate":"2016-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"AAC.02928-15","subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"\n              Protective effect of synbiotic against multidrug-resistant\n              Acinetobacter baumannii\n              in a murine infection model\n            ","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protective-effect-synbiotic-against-multidrugresistant-acinetobacter-baumannii-murine-infection-mode"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621460,"mean":6.5607387299425,"rank":784456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6826121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621460,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280808,"mean":10.868932291574,"rank":42819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":237085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280808,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5570,"mean":6.8887319087808,"rank":856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":4589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5570,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274,"mean":11.856197802198,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
