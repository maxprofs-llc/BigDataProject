In addition, muscle biopsy samples were obtained from gluteus medius muscle before exercise and immediately, 4 hours, 24 hours, 3 days and 7 days after exercise, and immunohistochemical analysis and relative quantitative analysis of mRNA expression using real-time RT-PCR were performed.\nOxygen consumption during exercise in H was 29% lower than that in N, and plasma lactate concentration in H was 47% higher than that in N. The mRNA expressions of satellite cell activation-related factors slightly increased, but the mRNA expressions of factors related to angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis slightly decreased. Fluorescence-stained basal lamina evaluation in stacked images 7 days after exercise showed no difference in capillary density between the two groups.\nThese results suggest that transient hypoxic exposure during exercise increases the contribution of the glycolytic energy supply and promotes satellite cell activation, but does not facilitate angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ab1","authors":["Okabe, Kazuma","Mukai, Kazutaka","Ohmura, Hajime","Takahashi, Toshiyuki","Miyata, Hirofumi"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T20:58:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-4707"],"journal":"Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness","last_mentioned_on":1457738032,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26955904?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26955904"],"pmid":"26955904","pubdate":"2016-03-10T22:01:53+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Effect of acute high-intensity exercise in normobaric hypoxia on Thoroughbred skeletal muscle.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7380163,"mean":6.412201927,"rank":1767047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4631150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7380163,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278494,"mean":10.793583407841,"rank":87689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":185231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278494,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":655,"mean":5.7432691131498,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":655,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.3214285714286,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MuscleStemCell\/statuses\/707924861302116353","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6156095],"posted_on":"2016-03-10T13:43:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Satellite Cell Bot","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507221205141577729\/FQlptquo_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweeting articles on muscle stem cells from pubmed RSS feeds.","id_on_source":"MuscleStemCell","tweeter_id":"2788297100","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":225},"tweet_id":"707924861302116353"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/708017347504644096","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6156095],"posted_on":"2016-03-10T19:51:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"708017347504644096"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hgosker\/statuses\/708305967168012289","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6156095],"posted_on":"2016-03-11T14:57:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Harry Gosker","url":"http:\/\/www.gosker.nl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2561835556\/image_normal.jpg","description":"Associate Prof at Maastricht University, research field metabolic impairments in muscle & fat in COPD.
