All samples were screened for HPIV-3 by real-time RT-PCR and followed by HN sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. In all RSV positive specimens, we screened for the other pathogens, and co-infection characteristics were evaluated.\nA total of 9.6% of 856 samples were positive for HPIV-3, the nucleotide among the strains ranged from 96.9% to 100%. All Hangzhou strains were placed in C3 subgroup based on HN gene analysis. 49% (n=41) of all HPIV-3-positive children with ARI were found to be co-infected with at least one of the other pathogen. The highest co-infection rate of HPIV-3 was with HRV (n=17). Children in the younger groups (\u226412 months old) were significantly more prone to be co-infected with other pathogen (\u03c7(2)=4.78, P=0.029). Pneumonia infection rate was significantly higher in the mono-infection group than the co-infection group (\u03c7(2)=3.92, P=0.048).\nHPIV-3 was an important pathogen in children with ARI in Hangzhou. HN gene variation rate was low, but showed a more local pattern. The co-infections with other respiratory viruses were popular. Except for pneumonia, no significant differences in other clinical presentation between the HPIV-3 mono-infection and co-infection groups were observed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000ce0b","authors":["Qian, X","Yu, X F","Zhao, M","Kou, Y","Li, J","Zhou, Y Y"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T22:11:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0253-9624"],"issue":"3","journal":"Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi Chinese journal of preventive medicine","last_mentioned_on":1457622095,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26957245?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26957245","pubdate":"2016-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","communicablediseases"],"title":"[Analysis of pathogenic features and infection status of human parainfluenza virus type 3 among children in Hangzhou].","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-pathogenic-features-infection-status-human-parainfluenza-virus-type-3-among-children-hangzh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377175,"mean":6.4096998099772,"rank":5579307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377175,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278481,"mean":10.792236771042,"rank":195622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278481,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":1.0571929824561,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.53333333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
