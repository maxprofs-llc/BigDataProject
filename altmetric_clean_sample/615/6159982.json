Furthermore, previous gestational diabetes mellitus increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes mellitus, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Factors contributing to vascular changes remain uncertain. The aim of this review was to summarize vascular structure and function changes found to occur in women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus and to identify factors that contribute to vascular dysfunction. A systematic search of electronic databases yielded 15 publications from 1998 to March 2014 that met the inclusion criteria. Our review confirmed that previous gestational diabetes mellitus contributes to vascular dysfunction, and the most consistent risk factor associated with previous gestational diabetes mellitus and vascular dysfunction was elevated body mass index. Heterogeneity existed across studies in determining the relationship of glycaemic levels and insulin resistance to vascular dysfunction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070fe","authors":["Jensen, Louise A","Chik, Constance L","Ryan, Edmond A","Louise A Jensen","Constance L Chik","Edmond A Ryan"],"doi":"10.1177\/1479164115624681","endpage":"182","first_seen_on":"2016-03-11T16:08:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1752-8984","1479-1641"],"issue":"3","journal":"Diabetes and Vascular Disease Research","last_mentioned_on":1458055644,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26940821?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dvr.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/02\/1479164115624681.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dvr.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/02\/1479164115624681.full.pdf","pmid":"26940821","pubdate":"2016-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"170","subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Review of gestational diabetes mellitus effects on vascular structure and function","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-gestational-diabetes-mellitus-effects-vascular-structure-function-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7396084,"mean":6.428716941112,"rank":1683367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5694331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7396084,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278144,"mean":10.839496978173,"rank":82879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":194113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278144,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":2.4734246575342,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.0083333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":5,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"PE":1,"GB":1,"CA":2,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MoisesRosasMD\/statuses\/708095114699272192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6159982],"posted_on":"2016-03-11T01:00:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr. Moises Rosas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/707285864263651328\/kwCf-jIf_normal.jpg","description":"Experto en Estad\u00edstica Aplicada.
