This has drawn attention to the potential importance of Fusarium species as pathogens of forest trees. In this study, we explored the diversity of Fusarium species associated with diseased Pinus patula, P.\u00a0tecunumanii, P.\u00a0kesiya and P.\u00a0maximinoi in Colombian plantations and nurseries. Plants displaying symptoms associated with a F.\u00a0circinatum-like infection (i.e., stem cankers and branch die-back on trees in plantations and root or collar rot of seedlings) were sampled. A total of 57 isolates were collected and characterised based on DNA sequence data for the translation elongation factor 1-\u03b1 and \u03b2-tubulin gene regions. Phylogenetic analyses of these data allowed for the identification of more than 10 Fusarium species. These included F.\u00a0circinatum, F.\u00a0oxysporum, species within the Fusarium solani species complex and seven novel species in the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex (formerly the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex), five of which are described here as new. Selected isolates of the new species were tested for their pathogenicity on Pinus patula and compared with that of F.\u00a0circinatum. Of these, F. marasasianum, F. parvisorum and F. sororula displayed levels of pathogenicity to P. patula that were comparable with that of F. circinatum. These apparently emerging pathogens thus pose a significant risk to forestry in Colombia and other parts of the world.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008a7c","authors":["Herron, D A","Wingfield, M J","Wingfield, B D","Rodas, C A","Marincowitz, S","Steenkamp, E T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.simyco.2014.12.001","endpage":"150","first_seen_on":"2016-03-10T20:22:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0166-0616","01660616"],"journal":"Studies In Mycology","last_mentioned_on":1457655189,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26955193?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26955193","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"131","title":"Novel taxa in the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex from Pinus spp.","type":"article","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-taxa-fusarium-fujikuroi-species-complex-pinus-spp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7380153,"mean":6.4120828327074,"rank":5323483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1798466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7380153,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278499,"mean":10.793294292957,"rank":179968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":82850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278499,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":4.1463956043956,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.6166666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
