This may be caused by an abnormal adrenal 11 beta-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the 11 beta, 18, and 19-hydroxylations of DOC. A comparison of the urinary products of this enzyme including 18-OH-DOC, 19-nor-DOC, corticosterone (B), and 18-OH-B have not been described in the SS\/Jr. Therefore, these steroid products were measured at 7 and 12 weeks of age in 36 weanling male and female, SS\/Jr and SR\/Jr (n = 9 in each group), on a low-salt diet. In both the male and female SS\/Jr urinary free levels of 18-OH-DOC, 19-nor-DOC, and 18-OH-B were elevated, while B was not different at 6 and 10 weeks of age. The largest increases were in 18-OH-B levels, and these levels correlated with 18-OH-DOC and B but not 19-nor-DOC. The high degree of correlation between these steroids probably reflects their closely related dependence on adrenal 11 beta-hydroxylase biosynthesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9223cf058f61000d9c5","authors":["Griffing, G T","Melby, J C","Holbrook, M","Wilson, T","Azar, S","Delaney, M","Weiss, S"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-12T05:12:18+00:00","issns":["0730-0077"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinical and experimental hypertension Part A Theory and practice","last_mentioned_on":1494563458,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1893610"],"pmid":"1893610","pubdate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Elevated 18-hydroxy-corticosterone in inbred salt-sensitive rats.","type":"article","volume":"13"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8192854,"mean":6.9262032168704,"rank":4343983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2276316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8192854,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238225,"mean":12.367552899792,"rank":132350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238225,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.9233333333333,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Maya_and_Moksha\/statuses\/862887804417789952","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20058487],"posted_on":"2017-05-12T04:30:58+00:00","author":{"name":"You On A Gin","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/858504492341448704\/rASquOEo_normal.jpg","description":"Speelt professioneel met geluid.\nVolgt \u00f3f uit interesse dan wel leedvermaak.\nInformatiespons.
