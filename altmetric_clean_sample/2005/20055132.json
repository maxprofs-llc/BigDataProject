Here, we explore a new concept for quantifying information common in two time series by cross-compressibility. Cross-compression entropy (CCE) exploits the ZIP data compression algorithm extended to bivariate data analysis. First, time series are transformed into symbol vectors. Symbols of the target time series are coded by the symbols of the source series. Uncoupled and linearly coupled surrogates were derived from cardiovascular recordings of 36 healthy controls obtained during rest to demonstrate suitability of this method for assessing physiological coupling. CCE at rest was compared to that of isometric handgrip exercise. Finally, spontaneous baroreflex interaction assessed by CCEBRS was compared between 21 patients suffering from acute schizophrenia and 21 matched controls. The CCEBRS of original time series was significantly higher than in uncoupled surrogates in 89% of the subjects and higher than in linearly coupled surrogates in 47% of the subjects. Handgrip exercise led to sympathetic activation and vagal inhibition accompanied by reduced baroreflex sensitivity. CCEBRS decreased from 0.553 \u00b1 0.030 at rest to 0.514 \u00b1 0.035 during exercise (p < 0.001). In acute schizophrenia, heart rate, and blood pressure were elevated. Heart rate variability indicated a change of sympathovagal balance. The CCEBRS of patients with schizophrenia was reduced compared to healthy controls (0.546 \u00b1 0.042 vs. 0.507 \u00b1 0.046, p < 0.01) and revealed a decrease of blood pressure influence on heart rate in patients with schizophrenia. Our results indicate that CCE is suitable for the investigation of linear and non-linear coupling in cardiovascular time series. CCE can quantify causal interactions in short, noisy and non-stationary physiological time series.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc19","authors":["Schumann, Andy","Schulz, Steffen","Voss, Andreas","Scharbrodt, Susann","Baumert, Mathias","B\u00e4r, Karl-J\u00fcrgen","Andy Schumann","Steffen Schulz","Andreas Voss","Susann Scharbrodt","Mathias Baumert","Karl-J\u00fcrgen B\u00e4r"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphys.2017.00282","first_seen_on":"2017-05-12T01:35:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1664-042X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1495792845,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphys.2017.00282\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FPHYS_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit%0A","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28539889?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC5423936","pmid":"28539889","pubdate":"2017-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Baroreflex Coupling Assessed by Cross-Compression Entropy","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/baroreflex-coupling-assessed-crosscompression-entropy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":6275946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1118285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244139,"mean":12.305491328675,"rank":172021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":45994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244139,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2896,"mean":5.7454645941278,"rank":1603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2896,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212,"mean":3.1339336492891,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Sports and Recreations":2,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontPhysiol\/statuses\/862843540291727360","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20055132],"posted_on":"2017-05-12T01:35:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Physiol","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Physiology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533286083207766016\/8U7NEYhH_normal.jpeg","description":"Frontiers in Physiology is the largest open-access journal in the field of Physiology.","id_on_source":"FrontPhysiol","tweeter_id":"397339470","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":2077},"tweet_id":"862843540291727360"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CardioTargets\/statuses\/868044226726170624","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20055132],"posted_on":"2017-05-26T10:00:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardio-Targets","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/756797512640557056\/17A66kqV_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"CardioTargets","tweeter_id":"756793267266711552","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":21},"tweet_id":"868044226726170624"}]}}
