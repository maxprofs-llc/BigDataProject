Laser settings were within the range of clinically used settings. The laser plume (aerosol) was suctioned and collected and then reinoculated onto the skin of calves.\nUniversity laboratory research center.\nLaser plume viral content and postinoculation tumor growth were analyzed and documented.\nCollected laser plume contained papillomavirus DNA in all tested laser settings. The viral DNA was most likely encapsulated. Tumors developed at laser plume-inoculated sites for all laser parameter settings. Histological and biochemical analyses revealed that these tumors were infected with the same virus type as present in the laser plume.\nLaser plume has been shown, for the first time to our knowledge, to actually transmit disease. Strict care must be maintained by the laser practitioner to minimize potential health risks, especially when treating viral-induced lesions or patients with viral disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006af6","authors":["Garden, Jerome M","O'Banion, M Kerry","Bakus, Abnoeal D","Olson, Carl"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-12T05:24:03+00:00","issns":["0003-987X"],"issue":"10","journal":"Archives of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1494491442,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12374535"],"pmid":"12374535","pubdate":"2002-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Viral disease transmitted by laser-generated plume (aerosol).","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/viral-disease-transmitted-lasergenerated-plume-aerosol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":1176529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6936818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237618,"mean":12.376306409053,"rank":49374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":186077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237618,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1339,"mean":4.9797189835575,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":1170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1339,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":3,"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Chemistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Profit motive \u2014 and scant evidence \u2014 propel dire warnings about 'surgical smoke'","url":"https:\/\/www.statnews.com\/2017\/05\/11\/surgical-smoke-health-risks\/?s_campaign=stat:rss","license":"public","citation_ids":[1406077,6676241,20058856,3938668,20058860,20058862,1391137,1391138,1943690,9914799,20058863],"posted_on":"2017-05-11T08:30:42+00:00","summary":"T he claims sound terrifying: Just breathing the air in an operating room where hot surgical tools are being used to slice and cauterize tissue \u2014 emitting puffs of caustic smoke in the process \u2014 is said to be the equivalent of smoking up to 30\u2026","author":{"name":"Stat News","url":"http:\/\/www.statnews.com","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/404\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-12-10_at_14.17.42.png?1449757087"}},{"title":"Profit motive \u2014 and scant evidence \u2014 propel dire warnings about 'surgical smoke'","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30529887926&p=1pl&v=1&x=HmF0mHEU5I7C8sG7zYVOPw","license":"public","citation_ids":[1406077,6676241,20058856,3938668,20058860,20058862,1391137,1391138,1943690,9914799,20058863],"posted_on":"2017-05-11T08:30:42+00:00","summary":"T he claims sound terrifying: Just breathing the air in an operating room where hot surgical tools are being used to slice and cauterize tissue \u2014 emitting puffs of caustic smoke in the process \u2014 is said to be the equivalent of smoking up to 30\u2026","author":{"name":"Stat News","url":"http:\/\/www.statnews.com","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/404\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-12-10_at_14.17.42.png?1449757087"}}]}}
