This article serves as a guide to answer 2 questions that should be asked when presented with a ruminant with neurologic dysfunction: Is the lesion rostral or caudal to the foramen magnum? and Does the animal have primary neurologic disease? The answers to these 2 broad questions begin the thought processes to more specifically describe the location and nature of the dysfunction. Challenges often facing the diagnostician include economic constraints, size of the animal, and unruly behavior.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c6d","authors":["Kevin E.
