However, the genetic relevance of this pathway to aggressive prostate cancer at the SNP level remains undefined. Here we performed a SNP and gene-based association analysis of the RTK\/ERK pathway with aggressive prostate cancer in a cohort comprising 956 aggressive and 347 non-aggressive cases. We identified several loci including rs3217869\/CCND2 within the pathway shown to be significantly associated with aggressive prostate cancer. Our functional analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship between rs3217869 risk genotype and decreased CCND2 expression levels in a collection of 119 prostate cancer patient samples.\u00a0Reduced expression\u00a0of CCND2 promoted cell proliferation and its\u00a0overexpression inhibited cell growth of\u00a0prostate cancer. Strikingly, CCND2 downregulation was consistently observed in the advanced prostate cancer in 18 available clinical data sets with a total amount of 1,095 prostate samples. Furthermore, the lower expression levels of CCND2 markedly correlated with prostate tumor progression to high Gleason score and elevated PSA levels, and served as an independent predictor of biochemical relapse and overall survival in a large cohort of prostate cancer patients. Together, we have identified an association of genetic variants and genes in the RTK\/ERK pathway with prostate cancer aggressiveness, and highlighted the potential importance of CCND2 in prostate cancer susceptibility and tumor progression to metastasis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yang Chen","Qin Zhang","Qiuyan Wang","Jie Li","Csilla Sipeky","Jihan Xia","Ping Gao","Yanling Hu","Haiying Zhang","Xiaobo Yang","Haitao Chen","Yonghua Jiang","Yuehong Yang","Ziting Yao","Yinchun Chen","Yong Gao","Aihua Tan","Ming Liao","Johanna Schleutker","Jianfeng Xu","Yinghao Sun","Gong-Hong Wei","Zengnan Mo"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-04731-4","first_seen_on":"2017-07-03T09:10:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1505315222,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-04731-4?WT.feed_name=subjects_cancer&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-04731-4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-04731-4.pdf","pmid":"28674394","pubdate":"2017-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"s41598-017-04731-4","subjects":["science"],"title":"Genetic association analysis of the RTK\/ERK pathway with aggressive prostate cancer highlights the potential role of CCND2 in disease progression","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-association-analysis-rtkerk-pathway-aggressive-prostate-cancer-highlights-potential-role-ccn"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409376,"mean":7.0790526953473,"rank":6381689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1141437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409376,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233101,"mean":12.92794057486,"rank":166061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":41758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233101,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37455,"mean":14.710448924014,"rank":26970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":6313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37455,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633,"mean":14.387175110132,"rank":2536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChpHealthcare\/statuses\/881801004332666886","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21485472],"posted_on":"2017-07-03T09:05:17+00:00","author":{"name":"ChpHealthcare.com","url":"http:\/\/www.chphealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/535842796460965888\/hR1KY45G_normal.png","id_on_source":"ChpHealthcare","tweeter_id":"2905419084","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":259},"tweet_id":"881801004332666886"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Genetic association analysis of the RTK\/ERK pathway with aggressive prostate cancer highlights the potential role of CCND2 in disease progression","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=832795896898532&id=396915973819862","license":"public","citation_ids":[21485472],"posted_on":"2017-09-13T15:07:02+00:00","summary":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-04731-4","author":{"name":"Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at University of Oulu","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/396915973819862","facebook_wall_name":"Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at University of Oulu","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/396915973819862\/picture","id_on_source":"396915973819862"}}]}}
