Demographic data and possible confounding factors were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Genotyping was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan probe methods.\nCompared to the UTUC group, the control group had significantly more alcohol drinkers and coffee drinkers but not cigarette smokers. Statistical analyses showed that UTUC risk correlated with AURKA rs2273535 (adjusted odds ratio = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.07-6.15) and with survivin rs9904341 (adjusted odds ratio = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.03-3.26) polymorphisms but not with p21 and p53 polymorphisms. The bladder cancer risk showed no significant correlations with the 4 polymorphisms. In both the UTUC and UC groups, disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly longer in patients with the rs1801270CC genotype compared to those with CA+AA genotypes. Poor prognosis did not correlate with polymorphisms in AURKA, survivin, and p53 genes.\nThese results suggest that cell cycle regulatory gene polymorphisms rs2273535 and rs9904341 may contribute to UTUC susceptibility; gene polymorphism rs1801270 may contribute to prognosis of UTUC and prognosis of UC. The p53 polymorphisms may not correlate with UTUC susceptibility and prognosis of UTUC or UC. Further well-designed, large-scale studies are needed to clarify these findings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e2","authors":["Lin, Ying-Chu","Hour, Tzyh-Chyuan","Tsai, Yu-Chieh","Huang, Shu-Pin","Wu, Wen-Jeng","Chen, Chung-Hsin","Pu, Yeong-Shiau","Chung, Shiu-Dong","Huang, Chao-Yuan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urolonc.2016.08.001","first_seen_on":"2017-07-03T10:28:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1078-1439","1873-2496"],"journal":"Urologic Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1499077414,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28668478?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28668478","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Preliminary evidence of polymorphisms of cell cycle regulatory genes and their roles in urinary tract urothelial cancer susceptibility and prognosis in a Taiwan population","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preliminary-evidence-polymorphisms-cell-cycle-regulatory-genes-roles-urinary-tract-urothelial-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":4520094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2355996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236262,"mean":12.966353803632,"rank":132135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":81983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236262,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":567,"mean":3.2049929328622,"rank":264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":567,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.9210526315789,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/genomeguardian\/statuses\/881820704622104576","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21486987],"posted_on":"2017-07-03T10:23:34+00:00","author":{"name":"TP53","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516935062370000897\/PnU7aavz_normal.jpeg","description":"A twitterbot dedicated to supplying the most recent papers about p53, the Guardian of the Genome.","id_on_source":"genomeguardian","tweeter_id":"2794540623","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":175},"tweet_id":"881820704622104576"}]}}
