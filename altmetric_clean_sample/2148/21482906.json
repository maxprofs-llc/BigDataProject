The findings were discussed with all ARM-net consortium members and a set of practical recommendations agreed upon at the annual meeting in 2016.\nWe defined seven domains that are essential to provide an effective and practical transition process. Within each domain we have developed a set of key recommendations that are important to be considered for ARM patients entering the age of transition.\nIt is crucial that transition begins at an early age with regular and well-structured follow-up. Cooperation with a selected multidisciplinary team of pediatric and adult practitioners is required to prepare patients and families for effective transition to adult care and to reduce long term morbidity.\nReview\/Consensus paper.\nIII.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd6","authors":["Giuliani, Stefano","Grano, Caterina","Aminoff, Dalia","Schwarzer, Nicole","Van De Vorle, Mariette","Cretolle, Celia","Haanen, Michel","Brisighelli, Giulia","Marzheuser, Stefanie","Connor, Martin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpedsurg.2017.06.008","first_seen_on":"2017-07-03T06:39:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0022-3468","00223468","1531-5037"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Surgery (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1499703250,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jpedsurg.2017.06.008","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28688794?dopt=Abstract&btz23=1111075710"],"pmid":"28688794","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pediatrics"],"title":"Transition of care in patients with Anorectal Malformations: Consensus by the ARM-net consortium","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transition-care-patients-anorectal-malformations-consensus-armnet-consortium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":1.35,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187776,"mean":6.9233436649085,"rank":4040028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4084854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187776,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190371,"mean":11.545305226664,"rank":92225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":96123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190371,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2030,"mean":2.1454499753573,"rank":780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":1231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2030,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.275,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eerr_es\/statuses\/884369597012615169","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21482906],"posted_on":"2017-07-10T11:11:57+00:00","author":{"name":"EnfermedadesRaras.es","url":"http:\/\/www.enfermedadesraras.es","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2631511713\/0750f88e51f844df2c68f65ace233f92_normal.jpeg","description":"Web dedicada a la informaci\u00f3n sobre enfermedades raras.","id_on_source":"eerr_es","tweeter_id":"512511489","geo":{"lt":40,"ln":-4,"country":"ES"},"followers":6217},"tweet_id":"884369597012615169"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/trevijano_reyes\/statuses\/884445654889746432","license":"gnip","rt":["eerr_es"],"citation_ids":[21482906],"posted_on":"2017-07-10T16:14:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Reyes Trevijano","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"trevijano_reyes","tweeter_id":"823982075585974273","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":55},"tweet_id":"884445654889746432"}]}}
