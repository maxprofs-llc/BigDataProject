Standardized extracts of tamarind were significantly (p < 0.05) more efficient at O2 \u2022- scavenging (IC50 = 27.44 \u00b1 0.09) than those of litchi and rambutan (IC50 = 29.57 \u00b1 0.30 and 39.49 \u00b1 0.52 \u03bcg\/ml, respectively) and the quercetin standard (IC50 = 31.88 \u00b1 0.15 \u03bcg\/ml). Litchi extract proved significantly (p < 0.05) more effective for elastase and collagenase inhibition (88.29 \u00b1 0.25% and 79.46 \u00b1 0.92%, respectively) than tamarind (35.43 \u00b1 0.68% and 57.69 \u00b1 5.97%) or rambutan (31.08 \u00b1 0.38% and 53.99 \u00b1 6.18%). All extracts were safe to human skin fibroblasts and inhibit MMP-2, with litchi extract showing significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced inhibition over the standard, vitamin C (23.75 \u00b1 2.74% and 10.42 \u00b1 5.91% at 0.05 mg\/ml, respectively). Extracts suppress melanin production in B16F10 melanoma cells through inhibition of tyrosinase and TRP-2, with litchi extract being the most potent, even more so than kojic acid (standard). These results highlight the potential for adding value to agro-industrial waste, as the basis for the sustainable production of innovative, safe, anti-aging cosmetic products.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e22a83eeb12a8b4a55","authors":["LOURITH, NATTAYA","KANLAYAVATTANAKUL, MAYUREE","CHAIKUL, PUXVADEE","CHANSRINIYOM, CHAISAK","BUNWATCHARAPHANSAKUN, PICHAPORN"],"doi":"10.1590\/0001-3765201720160849","first_seen_on":"2017-07-03T06:01:30+00:00","issns":["0001-3765"],"journal":"Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias","last_mentioned_on":1498834800,"links":["http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S0001-37652017000200577&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/pdf\/aabc\/v89n1s0\/0001-3765-aabc-201720160849.pdf","pmid":"28538817","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["science"],"title":"In vitro and cellular activities of the selected fruits residues for skin aging treatment","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":7297891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235674,"mean":12.963062098755,"rank":193410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235674,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":2.4740549450549,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.95,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=691566927711064&id=372451436289283","license":"public","citation_ids":[21482312,21482313,21482314,21482315,21482316,21482317,21482318],"posted_on":"2017-06-30T15:00:00+00:00","summary":"Confiram os artigos na \u00e1rea de Ci\u00eancias Biol\u00f3gicas da nova edi\u00e7\u00e3o dos Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias! \n \n\u27a1\ufe0fConfira o artigo: \"Anesthesia of Epinephelus marginatus with essential oil of Aloysia polystachya: an approach on blood parameters.\" em htt","author":{"name":"Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/372451436289283","facebook_wall_name":"Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/372451436289283\/picture","id_on_source":"372451436289283"}}]}}
