We previously reported that pesticide-exposed agricultural workers (AW) have nigral diffusion tensor (DTI) changes. The current study sought to confirm this finding, and explore its hemisphere and regional specificity within BG structures using an independent sample population.\nPesticide exposure history, standard neurological exam, high resolution MRI (T1\/T2-weighted and DTI), and [ 123 I]ioflupane SPECT images (to quantify striatal dopamine transporters) were obtained from 20 AW with chronic pesticide exposure and 11 controls. Based on median cumulative days of pesticide exposure, AW were subdivided into high (AW Hi , n=10) and low (AW Lo , n=10) exposure groups. BG [nigra, putamen, caudate, and globus pallidus (GP)] fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and striatal [ 123 I]ioflupane binding in each hemisphere were quantified, and compared across exposure groups using ANOVA.\nLeft, but not right, nigral and GP FA were significantly lower in AW compared to controls (p's <0.029). None of the striatal (putamen and caudate) DTI or [ 123 I]ioflupane binding measurements differed between AW and controls. Subgroup analyses indicated that significant left nigral and GP DTI changes were present only in the AW Hi (p\u22640.037) but not the AW Lo subgroup.\nAW, especially those with higher pesticide exposure history, demonstrate lateralized microstructural changes in the nigra and GP, whereas striatal areas appear relatively unaffected. Future studies should elucidate how environmental toxicants cause differential lateralized- and regionally-specific brain vulnerability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003678","authors":["Lewis, Mechelle M.","Sterling, Nicholas W.","Du, Guangwei","Lee, Eun-Young","Shyu, Grace","Goldenberg, Michael","Allen, Thomas","Stetter, Christy","Kong, Lan","Snipes, Shedra Amy","Jones, Byron C.","Chen, Honglei","Mailman, Richard B.","Huang, Xuemei","Amy Snipes, Shedra"],"doi":"10.1093\/toxsci\/kfx126","first_seen_on":"2017-06-30T18:11:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-6080","1096-0929"],"journal":"Toxicological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1505207548,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28633499","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/toxsci\/article-abstract\/159\/1\/170\/3870487\/Lateralized-Basal-Ganglia-Vulnerability-to?redirectedFrom=fulltext","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/toxsci\/article-abstract\/159\/1\/170\/3870487\/Lateralized-Basal-Ganglia-Vulnerability-to#.Wbec453LPVI.twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/toxsci\/article-pdf\/159\/1\/170\/19636657\/kfx126.pdf","pmid":"28633499","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press (OUP)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Lateralized basal ganglia vulnerability to pesticide exposure in asymptomatic agricultural workers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lateralized-basal-ganglia-vulnerability-pesticide-exposure-asymptomatic-agricultural-workers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":1.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8404159,"mean":7.075409750737,"rank":3991363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4226433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8404159,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233906,"mean":12.954614959064,"rank":109673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":117192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233906,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2922,"mean":4.8996939404314,"rank":2356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2922,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":3.511914893617,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
