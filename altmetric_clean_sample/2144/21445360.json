One hundred and forty-eight elite Gaelic footballers underwent anthropometric (height, body mass, sum of seven skinfolds, % adipose tissue) and performance [counter movement jump height (CMJ), CMJ peak power, CMJ relative peak power, squat jump height (SJ), SJ peak power, SJ relative peak power, 5-, 10- and 20 m sprint times and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 2 (Yo-YoIRT2)] during 'the early in-season' phase. Data were split into five positional groups (full-back, half-back, midfield, half-forward and full-forward). Higher %AT was observed in full forwards when compared to the half backs (p = 0.001), midfielders (p = 0.035) and half forwards (p = 0.021). Full forwards had significantly greater SJ (p = 0.036) and CMJ (p = 0.013) when compared to the midfielders with no other positional differences observed. No significant variation in sprint times was observed across positions. When Yo-YoIRT2 was considered, full forwards and full backs completed significantly lower distances compared to the middle three positional lines of, half backs, midfielders and half forwards (p = 0.00). The current study is the first to provide normative data for anthropometric and performance values of elite Gaelic football players which in turn can be utilised by coaches to generate appropriate training regimes to maximise position specific preparation for competitive match-play.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Shovlin, Aidan","Roe, Mark","Malone, Shane","Collins, Kieran"],"doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0000000000002071","first_seen_on":"2017-06-30T18:01:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1064-8011","1533-4287"],"journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1504173694,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/publishahead\/The_Positional_Anthropometric_and_Performance.95908.aspx","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28658081\/?i=1&from=gaelic%20football"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/9000\/00000\/The_Positional_Anthropometric_and_Performance.95908.pdf","pmid":"28658081","pubdate":"2017-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"The Positional Anthropometric and Performance Profile of Elite Gaelic Football Players.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/The_Positional_Anthropometric_and_Performance.95908.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positional-anthropometric-performance-profile-elite-gaelic-football-players"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.95,"score_history":{"1y":17.95,"6m":17.95,"3m":5.6,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":499239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7954243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237214,"mean":12.994142471112,"rank":25017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":212158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237214,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3922,"mean":16.286691660291,"rank":967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3922,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":8.1394625,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":16,"researcher":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":16,"Scientists":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":4,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Sports and Recreations":6}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":15}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aidanshovlin\/statuses\/880848761718808576","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21445360],"posted_on":"2017-06-30T18:01:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Aidan Shovlin","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/845057141803286528\/JJNbFpzI_normal.jpg","description":"IRFU Sevens GPS Analysis | Research Masters student | Elite GAA injuries and history | GSRC, ITT Dublin | Donegal\/Dublin |","id_on_source":"aidanshovlin","tweeter_id":"461952396","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"880848761718808576"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Richie_Bolger\/statuses\/880861768016416768","license":"gnip","rt":["aidanshovlin"],"citation_ids":[21445360],"posted_on":"2017-06-30T18:53:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Richie Bolger","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/Richard_Bolger","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/494625927377457152\/QotFFyEz_normal.jpeg","description":"Here For A Good Time Not A Long Time My Dads Advice 1999 -
