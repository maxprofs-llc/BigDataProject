However, molecular basis of pancreatic cancer differentiation and potential therapeutic value of the underlying molecules remain unknown. We investigated the mechanistic underexpression of Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in pancreatic cancer and defined a novel epigenetic pathway of its activation for pancreatic cancer differentiation and treatment.<br \/><br \/>Experimental Design: Expressions of KLF4 and DNMT1 in pancreatic cancer tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry and the genetic and epigenetic alterations of KLF4 in and KLF4's impact on differentiation of pancreatic cancer were examined using molecular biology techniques. The function of dietary 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) on miR-152\/DNMT1\/KLF4 signaling in pancreatic cancer was evaluated using both cell culture and animal model.<br \/><br \/>Results: Overexpression of DNMT1 and promoter hypermethylation contributed to decreased KLF4 expression in and associated with poor differentiation of pancreatic cancer. Manipulation of KLF4 expression significantly affected differentiation marker expressions in pancreatic cancer cells. DIM treatment significantly induced miR-152 expression, which blocked DNMT1 protein expression and its binding to KLF4 promoter region, and consequently, reduced promoter DNA methylation and activated KLF4 expression in pancreatic cancer cells. Additionally, DIM treatment caused significant inhibition of cell growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in animal model of pancreatic cancer.<br \/><br \/>Conclusions: This is the first demonstration that dysregulated KLF4 expression associates with poor differentiation of pancreatic cancer. Epigenetic activation of miR-152\/DNMT1\/KLF4 signaling pathway by dietary DIM causes differentiation and significant growth inhibition of pancreatic cancer cells, highlighting its translational implications for pancreatic and other cancers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Victoria K Xie","Zhiwei Li","Yongmin Yan","Zhiliang Jia","Xiangsheng Zuo","Ju Zhenjin","Jing Wang","Jiawei Du","Dacheng Xie","Daoyan wei","Keping Xie","Victoria K.
