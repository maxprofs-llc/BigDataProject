Baldridge","A new mini-review from us within"],"citation":{"abstract":"Interferon-lambda (IFN-\u03bb) is a recently described cytokine found to be of critical importance in innate immune regulation of intestinal viruses. Endogenous IFN-\u03bb has potent antiviral effects and has been shown to control multiple intestinal viruses and may represent a factor that contributes to human variability in response to infection. Importantly, recombinant IFN-\u03bb has therapeutic potential against enteric viral infections, many of which lack other effective treatments. In this mini-review, we describe recent advances regarding IFN-\u03bb-mediated regulation of enteric viruses with important clinical relevance including rotavirus, reovirus, and norovirus. We also briefly discuss IFN-\u03bb interactions with other cytokines important in the intestine, and how IFN-\u03bb may play a role in regulation of intestinal viruses by the commensal microbiome. Finally, we indicate currently outstanding questions regarding IFN-\u03bb control of enteric infections that remain to be explored to enhance our understanding of this important immune molecule.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Lee, Sanghyun","Baldridge, Megan T."],"doi":"10.3389\/fimmu.2017.00749","first_seen_on":"2017-06-30T14:37:18+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"handles":[],"issns":["1664-3224"],"journal":"Frontiers in immunology","last_mentioned_on":1500941547,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fimmu.2017.00749\/full","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fimmu.2017.00749\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FIMMU_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit"],"pmcid":"PMC5491552","pmid":"28713375","pubdate":"2017-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Interferon-Lambda: A Potent Regulator of Intestinal Viral Infections","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interferonlambda-potent-regulator-intestinal-viral-infections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":2.85,"3m":2.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":3250023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4986194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221114,"mean":11.96707945711,"rank":74550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":145099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221114,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3570,"mean":3.077052395629,"rank":869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":2668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3570,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200,"mean":3.5316381909548,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
