Four male and one female Labrador-retriever pups were presented with clinical signs of head swaying with intention tremor, loss of target oriented movement, wide base stance, forelimb hypermetria, and hindlimb ataxia leading to falling off during ambulation. On histopathologic examination of cerebellum, cerebellar cortical abiotrophy was confirmed with extensive loss of Purkinje cells, diminution of granular layer, relative thickening and foliar gliosis in white matter. This is the first reported case of cerebellar abiotrophy in Labrador-retriever to our knowledge.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008ba7","authors":["Sen, Chandreyee","Sharma, Ashwani Kumar","Randhawa, Charanjeet Singh","Gupta, Kuldip"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.tcam.2017.06.003","first_seen_on":"2017-06-30T21:19:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1938-9736","19389736","1946-9837"],"issue":"1","journal":"Topics in Companion Animal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1498857622,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1938973617300016?dgcid=raven_sd_aip_email"],"pmid":"28750785","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Cerebellar cortical abiotrophy in young Labrador-Retrievers","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cerebellar-cortical-abiotrophy-young-labradorretrievers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":1.1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":4484215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3933007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236729,"mean":12.993826197154,"rank":130769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":104406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236729,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":2.1148299319728,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.983,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/880898510014599168","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21448578],"posted_on":"2017-06-30T21:19:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2116},"tweet_id":"880898510014599168"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/il0velabrad0r\/statuses\/880898830392283136","license":"gnip","rt":["Albinovet"],"citation_ids":[21448578],"posted_on":"2017-06-30T21:20:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Labrador Retriever","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LabradorRetrieverLoversUnited\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/722407143828103168\/Og5F4Z3T_normal.jpg","description":"All Labrador Retriever Lovers UNITE! :)","id_on_source":"il0velabrad0r","tweeter_id":"722406161169801217","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":522},"tweet_id":"880898830392283136"}]}}
