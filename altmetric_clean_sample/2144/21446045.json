Tai Chi is an exercise that integrates a martial art, deep breathing and mediation, and has various beneficial effects for health. This review summarizes current knowledge and recent literature on the association between exercise and gut microbiota, and explores the feasibility of Tai Chi for improving gut microbiota composition and function. PubMed\/MEDLINE was used to search the English literature for the keywords exercise and gut microbiota. Fourteen relevant studies were identified. In humans, exercise increases the gut microbial diversity. However, the evidence for this association is weak, as previous studies were small-scale, non-controlled studies of short duration or cross-sectional design. In animals, exercise alters the composition of gut microbiota, with some studies suggesting exercise increases the Bacteroidetes\/Firmicutes ratio. However, these results are controversial, partly because host genetics and physical fitness also influence gut microbiota. Furthermore, the intensity of exercise may play a key role in how exercise affects gut microbiota. Tai Chi is a moderate-intensity exercise that improves immune function and inflammation of the gut. Tai Chi may also affect gut microbiota through vagal modulation and mediating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, no studies have investigated the association between Tai Chi and gut microbiota. Well designed studies exploring the effects of Tai Chi on gut microbiota are needed.","altmetric_jid":"537f30862a83eeb45a8b4611","authors":["Hamasaki, Hidetaka"],"doi":"10.1016\/s2095-4964(17)60342-x","first_seen_on":"2017-06-30T18:27:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2095-4964","20954964"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Integrative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1499801874,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28659231?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28659231","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S209549641760342X"],"pmid":"28659231","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","title":"Exercise and gut microbiota: clinical implications for the feasibility of Tai Chi.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exercise-gut-microbiota-clinical-implications-feasibility-tai-chi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8193064,"mean":6.9264840328884,"rank":2074605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4998451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8193064,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200740,"mean":11.690312794225,"rank":64258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":134579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200740,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":8.1398085106383,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":3,"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sai_kai_cs\/statuses\/882488867877560320","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21446045],"posted_on":"2017-07-05T06:38:36+00:00","author":{"name":"nishi","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/501027822987530240\/nyq3fFab_normal.jpeg","description":"\u30d2\u30c8\u30c7\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u2192\u8178\u5185\u7d30\u83cc\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u2192\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\n\u3053\u306e\u79c1\u306e\u6065\u305a\u304b\u3057\u3044\u5984\u60f3\u3092","id_on_source":"sai_kai_cs","tweeter_id":"2739955039","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":31},"tweet_id":"882488867877560320"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MicrobiomePaper\/statuses\/880855353197445121","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21446045],"posted_on":"2017-06-30T18:27:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585212126173732865\/jEvg1KpB_normal.jpg","description":"The latest PubMed publications on Microbiome Research delivered direct to your Twitter Feed.
