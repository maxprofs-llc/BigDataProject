In this work, we determine the identity elements of each tRNA isoacceptor by means of the variation of information measure from information theory. We show that all isoacceptors exhibit sites associated with some bases of the anticodon. These sites form clusters that are scattered along the tRNA structure. The clusters determine the identity elements of each tRNA. We derive a catalogue of clustered sites for each tRNA that expands previously reported elements.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100066e1","authors":["Zamudio, Gabriel S.","Jos\u00e9, Marco V.","Gabriel S.
