Eyes with nvAMD having incomplete response to 3-9 prior bevacizumab injections were recruited. Three monthly intravitreal aflibercept (2\u2009mg) injections were administered, followed by two bi-monthly injections and a final examination at week 28. An optional injection was allowed at week 20.ResultsForty-seven eyes of 46 patients (mean\u00b1SD age 76\u00b18 years) were recruited. The mean number of prior bevacizumab injections was 5.5\u00b12.9. The mean visual acuity improved from 60.3\u00b110 ETDRS letters at baseline to 63.1\u00b115 letters at week 28 (P=0.02, paired t-test). The central subfield thickness (CST) reduced from 409\u00b1127 micron at baseline to 330\u00b1110 microns at week 4 (P=0.0002; paired t-test), and 277\u00b170 microns at week 28 (P=0.00002; paired t-test). Twenty-two eyes had three to five prior bevacizumab injections (mean 5.1\u00b10.7), and 25 eyes had six to nine prior injections (7.32\u00b11.2). Both groups had reduced CST from baseline to week 28 (P=0.0004 and P=0.0007; paired t-test, respectively). Thirty-five (75%) eyes required the optional additional aflibercept injection at week 20.ConclusionsThe ASLI study demonstrated improved BCVA and reduced CST following an early switch to aflibercept therapy in eyes with prior incomplete response to initial therapy with three to nine bevacizumab injections.Eye advance online publication, 17 February 2017; doi:10.1038\/eye.2017.7.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028a1","authors":["L Tiosano","O Segal","N Mathalone","A Pollack","R Ehrlich","I Klemperer","Y Barak","I Moroz","I Chowers","M Goldstein"],"doi":"10.1038\/eye.2017.7","first_seen_on":"2017-02-25T08:30:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0950-222X","1476-5454"],"journal":"Eye","last_mentioned_on":1488011413,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/eye\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/eye20177a.html?utm_content=bufferaacb8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/eye\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/eye20177a.html?utm_content=buffer64ca6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"28211882","pubdate":"2017-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Retinal diseases","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Outcomes research","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Aflibercept as a Second Line Therapy for Neovascular Age Related Macular Degeneration in Israel (ASLI) study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/eye.2017.7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aflibercept-second-line-therapy-neovascular-age-related-macular-degeneration-israel-asli-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":5981018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1996148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242479,"mean":13.634863484522,"rank":162979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":65480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242479,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1366,"mean":2.8329963369963,"rank":786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1366,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":2.2633928571429,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
