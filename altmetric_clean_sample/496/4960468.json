Treatment of reconstructed embryos with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) immediately after activation improves cloning efficiency. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the transcriptome of SCNT embryos treated with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), 4-iodo-SAHA (ISAHA), or Scriptaid as compared to untreated SCNT, in vitro-fertilized (IVF), and in vivo (IVV) blastocyst-stage embryos. SAHA (10\u2009\u03bcM) had the highest level of blastocyst development at 43.9%, and all treatments except 10\u2009\u03bcM ISAHA had the same percentage of blastocyst development as Scriptaid (p<0.05). Two treatments, 1.0\u2009\u03bcM ISAHA and 1.0\u2009\u03bcM SAHA, had higher mean cell number than No HDACi treatment (p<0.021). Embryo transfers performed with 10\u2009\u03bcM SAHA- and 1\u2009\u03bcM ISAHA-treated embryos resulted in the birth of healthy piglets. GenBank accession numbers from up- and downregulated transcripts were loaded into the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery to identify enriched biological themes. HDACi treatment yielded the highest enrichment for transcripts within the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway, lysosome. The mean intensity of LysoTracker was lower in IVV embryos compared to IVF and SCNT embryos (p<0.0001). SAHA and ISAHA can successfully be used to create healthy piglets from SCNT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ce","authors":["Whitworth, Kristin M","Mao, Jiude","Lee, Kiho","Spollen, William G","Samuel, Melissa S","Walters, Eric M","Spate, Lee D","Prather, Randall S"],"doi":"10.1089\/cell.2015.0022","first_seen_on":"2016-01-06T14:06:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2152-4998"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cellular Reprogramming","last_mentioned_on":1452085222,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26731590"],"pmcid":"PMC4529055","pmid":"26731590","pubdate":"2016-01-06T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Transcriptome Analysis of Pig In Vivo, In Vitro-Fertilized, and Nuclear Transfer Blastocyst-Stage Embryos Treated with Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Postfusion and Activation Reveals Changes in the Lysosomal Pathway.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptome-analysis-pig-vivo-vitrofertilized-nuclear-transfer-blastocyststage-embryos-treated-his"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6912770,"mean":6.208179930211,"rank":3391283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2015942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6912770,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302182,"mean":9.0653131533748,"rank":155553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":113680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302182,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":2.13734,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
