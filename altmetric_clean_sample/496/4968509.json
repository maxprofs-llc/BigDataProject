A prolonged 18\u2005h fast reduced her plasma glucose without suppressing insulin secretion, while plasma \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate levels were suppressed. Despite the prolonged fast, the glucose response to glucagon was increased by 25\u2005mg\/dL (1.39\u2005mM) glucose, which is compatible with insulinoma. A 75\u2005g oral glucose tolerance test (75\u2005g OGTT) showed impaired glucose tolerance. An abdominal CT scan revealed a mass lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas, a finding consistent with the results of angiography and selective artery calcium injection test. The patient then underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy; the pancreatic mass was histologically diagnosed as benign insulinoma. After surgery, a prolonged 24\u2005h fast caused no hypoglycaemia and the glucose tolerance capacity in 75\u2005g OGTT improved. Eight months after surgery, the patient's body weight had reduced by 10\u2005kg. This is therefore a case of concurrent insulinoma and impaired glucose tolerance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Katsumi Iizuka","Taro Fujisawa","Jun Takeda","Iizuka, Katsumi","Fujisawa, Taro","Takeda, Jun"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2015-213793","first_seen_on":"2016-01-08T05:17:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1464525748,"links":["http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2016\/bcr-2015-213793?etoc","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26729835\/?i=17#pq=ULXkWl"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2016\/bcr-2015-213793.full.pdf","pmid":"26729835","pubdate":"2016-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","startpage":"bcr2015213793","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Concurrent insulinoma and impaired glucose tolerance suspected as owing to obesity","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/concurrent-insulinoma-impaired-glucose-tolerance-suspected-owing-obesity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7826281,"mean":6.6353071855279,"rank":3000551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4814712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7826281,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314002,"mean":9.268282037318,"rank":98724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":214602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314002,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3000,"mean":4.7879886628876,"rank":651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3000,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":5.1717142857143,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1,"ZA":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yasuharutokuda\/statuses\/685329407657967616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4968509],"posted_on":"2016-01-08T05:17:18+00:00","author":{"name":"\u5fb3\u7530\u5b89\u6625","url":"http:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/tokudayasuharunokoushikipeji\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1671098360\/image_normal.jpg","description":"\u7dcf\u5408\u8a3a\u7642\u533b\u3000\u7b51\u6ce2\u5927\u5ba2\u54e1\u6559\u6388http:\/\/blog.goo.ne.jp\/yasuharutokuda http:\/\/blog.goo.ne.jp\/yasuharutokuda-g\u3000 \u3000\n\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb: hidetkdre20b@yahoo.co.jp","id_on_source":"yasuharutokuda","tweeter_id":"95121233","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":4915},"tweet_id":"685329407657967616"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/diabetesfuna\/statuses\/685416525809856513","license":"gnip","rt":["yasuharutokuda"],"citation_ids":[4968509],"posted_on":"2016-01-08T11:03:28+00:00","author":{"name":"\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u8239\u6a4b\u5e02\u2122","url":"https:\/\/type1dm.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/639589799171518465\/9egGcKS2_normal.jpg","description":"\u8239\u6a4b\u5e02\u306e\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u6cbb\u7642\u306b\u60c5\u71b1\u3092\u71c3\u3084\u3059\u5185\u79d1\u533b\u3002","id_on_source":"diabetesfuna","tweeter_id":"61876368","geo":{"lt":35.69306,"ln":139.98333,"country":"JP"},"followers":766},"tweet_id":"685416525809856513"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fmborrageiro\/statuses\/736873839506886656","license":"gnip","rt":["dr_kevinlee"],"citation_ids":[4968509],"posted_on":"2016-05-29T10:56:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Filomena Borrageiro","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/517375571643625472\/rtNn4Tip_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"fmborrageiro","tweeter_id":"921162140","geo":{"lt":-33.92584,"ln":18.42322,"country":"ZA"},"followers":257},"tweet_id":"736873839506886656"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dr_kevinlee\/statuses\/736872503805673472","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4968509],"posted_on":"2016-05-29T10:51:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Kevin Lee \ud83c\udf08","url":"http:\/\/www.banyoclinic.com.au\/dr-kevin-lee-endocrinologist\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/901558621682622464\/BVO9uCHI_normal.jpg","description":"Opinions mine, not employers\/affiliated institutions.
