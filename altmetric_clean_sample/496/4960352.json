In this study, the dynamic aspect of a surface has been probed by choosing small metal clusters as illustrative models. Two anionic heterotrimetallic clusters, namely W2TcO6 \u2012 and W2OsO6 \u2012 were reacted with H2S gas to exhibit splitting of the gas molecule and complete oxygen\u2012sulfur exchange in the metal core. During this atom-exchange process, the core exhibits remarkable fluxionality to augment a thiol proton migration from one metal center to another, as well as a rapid interchange of the terminal and bridging oxygens. The fluxional nature of the core is further evidenced by two oppositely oriented oxo groups working in concert to accomplish the proton transfer, upon introduction of sulfur inside the core. These fluxional processes in the small heterotrimetallic cores closely resemble the dynamic nature of the surface in a heterogeneous reaction. Throughout the fluxional processes investigated in this study, two-state reactivity and multiple instances of spin crossover are observed in our computational studies. Interestingly, the neutral heterotrimetallic cores can also undergo complete oxygen\u2012sulfur exchange reaction with H2S. The investigated metal clusters are promising materials, since they not only can liberate dihydrogen from water (reported in J. Phys. Chem. A, 2014, 118, 11047), but also completely strip the sulfur from environmentally hazardous H2S gas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Adhikari, Debashis","Raghavachari, Krishnan"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpca.5b10899","first_seen_on":"2016-01-06T13:58:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5215"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","last_mentioned_on":1453244883,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26730799?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.jpca.5b10899"],"pmid":"26730799","pubdate":"2016-01-06T22:00:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
