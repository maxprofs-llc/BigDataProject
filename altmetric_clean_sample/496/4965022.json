Therefore, mathematical models, along with the associated analysis and control methods, are highly needed in this research field. In the present work, we provide a first model of the genetic regulatory network driving the cellular fate determination at the stage of lymphoid lineage commitment, in particular during lineage restriction of multipotent progenitors to early B-cell committed precursors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9253cf058f61000dc6b","authors":["Salerno, Luca","Cosentino, Carlo","Morrone, Giovanni","Bilotta, Mariaconcetta","Amato, Francesco"],"doi":"10.1109\/embc.2015.7319601","first_seen_on":"2016-01-07T11:26:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-170X"],"journal":"Conference proceedings Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","last_mentioned_on":1452165993,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26737501?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26737501","pubdate":"2016-01-07T22:00:17+00:00","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"A control-theoretical approach to the identification of a commitment switch in B lymphopoiesis cell fate determination.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/controltheoretical-approach-identification-commitment-switch-b-lymphopoiesis-cell-fate-determination"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6918109,"mean":6.2122534265127,"rank":5159788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":988658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6918109,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302338,"mean":9.0694260047561,"rank":206667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302338,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1254,"mean":1.3798675179569,"rank":562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1254,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211,"mean":1.3640666666667,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
