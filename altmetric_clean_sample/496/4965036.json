Half of each scar was randomized to treatment with a 595-nm PDL and the contralateral half with the 1064-nm Nd:YAG. Each patient received 6 laser treatment sessions at one month intervals. The scars were evaluated at baseline and one month after last laser session using the Vancouver scar scale (VSS).\nOne month after the last laser treatment, final total VSS analysis of treated sites by PDL and long pulsed Nd:YAG laser revealed significant improvements (p<0.001), whereas the average percentage of improvement the total VSS were 55.14% for PDL and 65.44% for Nd:YAG laser. However, there were no statistically significant differences between PDL and long pulsed Nd:YAG laser treated sites for total VSS (p=0.074).\nThis was a single-center non-controlled trial, include the small number of the patients and subjective outcome measure.\nPulsed dye laser and long pulsed Nd:YAG laser treatments for keloid and hypertrophic scar provide significant improvement with insignificant difference between both modalities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fb0","authors":["Al-Mohamady, Abd El-Shakour Abd El-Hafiz","Ibrahim, Shady Mahmoud Attia","Muhammad, Muhammad Mohsen","Abd El-Shakour Abd El-Hafiz Al-Mohamady","Shady Mahmoud Attia Ibrahim","Muhammad Mohsen Muhammad"],"doi":"10.3109\/14764172.2015.1114648","endpage":"212","first_seen_on":"2016-01-07T11:27:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-4180","1476-4172"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Cosmetic & Laser Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1496140328,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26735516?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26735516","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26735516?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26735516","pubdate":"2016-01-07T22:00:55+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"208","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Pulsed dye laser versus long pulsed Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloid: A comparative randomized split-scar trial.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pulsed-dye-laser-versus-longpulsed-ndyag-laser-treatment-hypertrophic-scars-keloid-comparative-rando"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":4170821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3907233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319246,"mean":9.3921915268834,"rank":152952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":154010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319246,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261,"mean":2.2379692307692,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.8875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/statuses\/685060073480044549","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4965036],"posted_on":"2016-01-07T11:27:03+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":58},"tweet_id":"685060073480044549"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/statuses\/869501676603949056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4965036],"posted_on":"2017-05-30T10:32:08+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":58},"tweet_id":"869501676603949056"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Pulsed dye laser versus long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloid: A comparative randomized split-scar trial. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=813909332084422&id=167734960035199","license":"public","citation_ids":[4965036,4965036],"posted_on":"2016-10-19T11:30:00+00:00","summary":"Synchro VasQ vs Synchro REPLA:Y HP for scars and keloids treatment: both of them provide significant improvement!
