Lenses were divided into 15 groups (n=4 per group), the lens content was removed and the empty capsules were refilled with nanogel without peptides and nanogels with 13 combinations of 5 different peptides: two laminin-derived, two fibronectin-derived, and one collagen IV-derived peptide representing cell adhesion motifs. A control group of 4 lenses was refilled with hyaluronan. After refilling, lenses were extracted from the porcine eye and cultured for three weeks. LECs were assessed for morphology and alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) expression using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Compared to hyaluronan controls, lenses filled with nanogel had less CO formation, indicated by a lower \u03b1SMA expression (P=0.004). Microscopy showed differences in morphological cell response within the nanogel refilled groups. \u03b1SMA expression in these groups was highest in lenses refilled with nanogel without peptides (9.54\u00b111.29%). Overall, LEC transformation is reduced by the presence of nanogels and the response is improved even further by incorporation of extracellular matrix peptides representing adhesion motifs. Thus, nanomaterials targeting biological pathways, in our case interactions with integrin signaling, are a promising avenue toward reduction of CO. Further research is needed to optimize nanogel-peptide combinations that fully prevent CO.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002893","authors":["Nibourg, Lisanne M","Gelens, Edith","de Jong, Menno","Kuijer, Roel","van Kooten, Theo G","Koopmans, Steven A","Lisanne M.
