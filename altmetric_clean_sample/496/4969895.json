In order to properly anchor anything for a long-lasting future, a solid foundation needs to have been laid. For the zoological portion of biodiversity information, that firm foundation is best exemplified in the works of Charles Davies Sherborn. This man, like others of his ilk, was intimately focused on indexing names. This incredible focus was a life-long passion for him and culminated in his 9500-page Index Animalium of over 400,000 names of animals. This Index represents not only one of the most prodigious efforts in publication by a single man and the single most important reference to names in zoology, but a permanent legacy to the efforts of an indexer that proved to be an inspiration to many.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["Neal Evenhuis","Neal Evenhuis"],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.550.9697","first_seen_on":"2016-01-08T12:14:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1313-2970","1313-2989"],"issue":"550","journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1458057049,"links":["http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/articles.php?id=6237","http:\/\/doi.org\/10.3897\/zookeys.550.9697","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/zookeys.550.9697"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/lib\/ajax_srv\/article_elements_srv.php?action=download_pdf&item_id=6237","pmid":"26877650","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Charles Davies Sherborn and the \u201cIndexer\u2019s Club\u201d","type":"article","volume":"550","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/charles-davies-sherborn-indexers-club"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.016,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.016},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002013,"mean":6.750266627688,"rank":714141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7288323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002013,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316462,"mean":9.2944623065715,"rank":37123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":279338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316462,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2406,"mean":15.744278586279,"rank":522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2406,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235,"mean":15.122452991453,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"SE":1,"DK":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Charles Davies Sherborn","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=702547919#altmetric_citation_4fe81680-8ca6-43af-9ff2-7482f4443797","license":"public","citation_ids":[4969895],"posted_on":"2016-01-31T06:37:17+00:00","summary":"Charles Davies Sherborn (30 June 1861 \u2013 22 June 1942) was an English bibliographer, and geologist.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=32467920","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Glendoremus","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Glendoremus"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ZooKeys_Journal\/statuses\/685434291141107713","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4969895],"posted_on":"2016-01-08T12:14:04+00:00","author":{"name":"ZooKeys","url":"http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1154517305\/zookeys_logo_normal.jpg","description":"The next generation open access peer-reviewed journal in systematic zoology.
