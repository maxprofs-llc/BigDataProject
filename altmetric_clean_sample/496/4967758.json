After SLN biopsy, patients with a positive SLN underwent CLND then were randomized to adjuvant IFN or observation. QOL and PC scores were compared between patients who underwent SLNB alone, CLND without IFN, and CLND with IFN. Time to return to baseline QOL and PC scores reported at the time of SLNB was recorded and compared.\nThere were statistically significant differences in time to return to baseline QOL (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0018) and PC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0018) scores across the three treatment groups. The time to return to baseline QOL and PC scores was similar for SLND and CLND alone. Differences in time to return to baseline QOL and PC were sustained when stratified by recurrence status but did not differ significantly for different lymph node regions. There was a delay in return to baseline QOL and PC condition scores that was sustained beyond the cessation of IFN therapy.\nCLND is well-tolerated with a similar effect on self-reported QOL outcomes in both the short- and long-term compared with SLNB alone. IFN therapy is associated with worse QOL outcomes compared with SLNB and CLND, an effect that may be sustained following cessation of adjuvant IFN.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a31","authors":["Michael E.
