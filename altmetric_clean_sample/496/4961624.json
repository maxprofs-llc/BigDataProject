This approval was based on evidence from FAME trials which were conducted at a time when ranibizumab was not available. There is a paucity of data on implementation of guidance on selecting patients for this treatment modality and also on the real world outcome of fluocinolone therapy especially in those patients that have been unresponsive to ranibizumab therapy.\nRetrospective study of consecutive patients treated with fluocinolone between January and August 2014 at three sites were included to evaluate selection criteria used, baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes at 3-month time point.\nTwenty two pseudophakic eyes of 22 consecutive patients were included. Majority of patients had prior therapy with multiple intravitreal anti-VEGF injections. Four eyes had controlled glaucoma. At baseline mean VA and CRT were 50.7 letters and 631\u00a0\u03bcm respectively. After 3\u00a0months, 18 patients had improved CRT of which 15 of them also had improved VA. No adverse effects were noted. One additional patient required IOP lowering medication. Despite being unresponsive to multiple prior therapies including laser and anti-VEGF injections, switching to fluocinolone achieved treatment benefit.\nThe patient level selection criteria proposed by NICE guidance on fluocinolone appeared to be implemented. This data from this study provides new evidence on early outcomes following fluocinolone therapy in eyes with DMO which had not responded to laser and other intravitreal agents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cf","authors":["Ibrahim Elaraoud","Ibrahim Elaraoud","Walter Andreatta","Andrej Kidess","Ajay Bhatnagar","Marie Tsaloumas","Fahad Quhill","Yit Yang"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12886-015-0178-9","first_seen_on":"2016-01-06T17:13:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2415"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1452100378,"links":["http:\/\/bmcophthalmol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12886-015-0178-9?utm_content=buffercd2bb&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/bmcophthalmol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12886-015-0178-9?utm_content=buffer8d4b4&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcophthalmol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12886-015-0178-9?site=http:\/\/bmcophthalmol.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4700741","pmid":"26728265","pubdate":"2016-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Use of flucinolone acetonide for patients with diabetic macular oedema: patient selection criteria and early outcomes in real world setting","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/flucinolone-acetonide-patients-diabetic-macular-oedema-patient-selection-criteria-early-outcomes-rea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6912770,"mean":6.208179930211,"rank":4907678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1757990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6912770,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302182,"mean":9.065312326056,"rank":188724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":95660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302182,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":479,"mean":1.9362259414226,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":479,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.6952380952381,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
