When internal fixation is not possible, radial head arthroplasty has been advocated as the treatment of choice. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate clinical and radiological short-term results of patients with Mason type III radial head fractures treated with a cemented bipolar radial prosthesis.\nTwelve patients received cemented bipolar radial head hemiarthroplasty for comminuted radial head fractures. In all patients a CT scan was obtained prior to surgical treatment to assess all associated injuries. Postoperatively an early motion protocol was applied. All patients were evaluated clinically and radiologically at an average of 12.7 months.\nAccording to the Mayo Modified Wrist Score, the Mayo Elbow Performance Score, the functional rating index of Broberg and Morrey, and the DASH Score good to excellent results were obtained. Grip strength and range of motion were almost at the level of the unaffected contralateral side. Patient satisfaction was high, no instability or signs of loosening of the implant, and only mild signs of osteoarthritis were seen.\nOverall good to excellent short-term results for primary arthroplasty for comminuted radial head fractures were observed. These encouraging results warrant the conduction of further studies with long-term follow-up and more cases to see if these short-term results can be maintained over time.","altmetric_jid":"56b368402a83ee42788b45ad","authors":["Laun, Reinhold","Wild, Michael","Hakimi, Mohssen"],"doi":"10.3205\/iprs000071","first_seen_on":"2016-01-07T11:16:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2193-8091"],"journal":"GMS Interdisciplinary Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery DGPW","last_mentioned_on":1452165359,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26734534?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4686843","pmid":"26734534","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"One-year results of cemented bipolar radial head prostheses for comminuted radial head fractures.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oneyear-results-cemented-bipolar-radial-head-prostheses-comminuted-radial-head-fractures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6918109,"mean":6.2122534265127,"rank":5159785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":988672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6918109,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302339,"mean":9.0693844306701,"rank":206665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302339,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.0428571428571,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bipolar_Blogs\/statuses\/685057287547822080","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4964879],"posted_on":"2016-01-07T11:15:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Bipolar Blogs","url":"http:\/\/www.pathsoflight.us\/bipolarwinds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3605210516\/e9da8d6cabf3994c6ec4ab42483804b9_normal.png","description":"Blogs & news from the minds of people living with bipolar and researchers.
