Ex vivo, immunohistochemistry was performed.\nBaseline [(18)F]FMISO uptake and relative tumor volume (RTV) 2\u00a0days after 5-FU or 5-FU\u2009+\u2009PX-12 administration correlated significantly (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01). Under hypoxic breathing conditions, [(18)F]FDG uptake (-53.1\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4\u00a0%) and Ki67 expression (-16\u00a0%) decreased and RTV stagnated in the 5-FU\u2009+\u2009PX-12 treatment group, but not in 5-FU alone-treated tumors. Under normoxic breathing, [(18)F]FDG uptake (-23.5\u2009\u00b1\u200915.2\u00a0% and -72.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.1\u00a0%) and Ki67 expression (-5\u00a0% and -19\u00a0%) decreased and RTV stagnated in both the 5-FU and the combination treatment group, respectively.\nBaseline [(18)F]FMISO \u03bcPET may predict the beneficial effect of HIF-1\u03b1 inhibition during 5-FU chemotherapy in CRC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003115","authors":["De Bruycker, Sven","Vangestel, Christel","Van den Wyngaert, Tim","Wyffels, Leonie","Wouters, An","Pauwels, Patrick","Staelens, Steven","Stroobants, Sigrid"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11307-015-0926-5","first_seen_on":"2016-01-06T22:56:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1860-2002"],"journal":"Molecular Imaging & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1452120995,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26728163?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26728163","pubdate":"2016-01-07T22:03:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Baseline [(18)F]FMISO \u03bcPET as a Predictive Biomarker for Response to HIF-1\u03b1 Inhibition Combined with 5-FU Chemotherapy in a Human Colorectal Cancer Xenograft Model.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/baseline-18ffmiso-%CE%BCpet-predictive-biomarker-response-hif1%CE%B1-inhibition-combined-5fu-chemotherapy-huma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6912770,"mean":6.208179930211,"rank":5924326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6912770,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302182,"mean":9.0653391311828,"rank":246108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302182,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":1.7590666666667,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.0833333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/684871210086236161","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4962841],"posted_on":"2016-01-06T22:56:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"684871210086236161"}]}}
