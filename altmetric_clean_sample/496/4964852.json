Here we describe immunological studies in a 19 years old APDS patient for whom genetic diagnosis was discovered by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analysis. In addition to the progressive lymphopenia and defective antibody production we showed that the ability of patient's B cells to differentiate in vitro is severely reduced. An in depth analysis of the myeloid compartment showed an increased expression of CD83 activation marker on monocytes and mono-derived DC cells. Moreover, monocytes-derived macrophages (MDM) failed to solve Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette Gu\u00e8rin (BCG) infection in vitro. Selective p110\u03b4 inhibitor IC87114 restored the MDM capacity to kill BCG in vitro. Our data show that the constitutive activation of Akt-mTOR pathway induces important alterations also in the myeloid compartment providing new insights in order to improve therapeutic approach in these patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255c","authors":["Chiriaco, Maria","Brigida, Immacolata","Ariganello, Paola","Di Cesare, Silvia","Di Matteo, Gigliola","Taus, Francesco","Cittaro, Davide","Lazarevic, Dejan","Scarselli, Alessia","Santilli, Veronica","Attardi, Enrico","Stupka, Elia","Giannelli, Stefania","Fraziano, Maurizio","Finocchi, Andrea","Rossi, Paolo","Aiuti, Alessandro","Palma, Paolo","Cancrini, Caterina"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clim.2015.12.008","first_seen_on":"2016-01-07T11:14:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-7035","15216616"],"journal":"Clinical Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1479272995,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26732860?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.clim.2015.12.008"],"pmid":"26732860","pubdate":"2016-01-07T22:01:43+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"A case of APDS patient: defects in maturation and function and decreased in vitro anti-mycobacterial activity in the myeloid compartment.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-apds-patient-defects-maturation-function-decreased-vitro-antimycobacterial-activity-myeloid-com"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700406,"mean":6.6097173252523,"rank":741863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6927988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700406,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312691,"mean":9.2459093287278,"rank":40427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":271064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312691,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":616,"mean":2.3486569105691,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":616,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.4230769230769,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
