Numerous pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardio-cerebrovascular protection activities, are exhibited by the three primary bioactive constituents among the tanshinones, ie, tanshinone I (TNI), tanshinone IIA (TNIIA), and cryptotanshinone (CPT). However, due to their poor solubility and low dissolution rate, the clinical applications of TNI, TNIIA, and CPT are limited. To solve these problems, many studies have focused on loading tanshinones into liposomes, nanoparticles, microemulsions, cyclodextrin inclusions, solid dispersions, and so on. In this review, we aim to offer an updated summary of the biological activities and drug delivery systems of tanshinones to provide a reference for these constituents in clinical applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["Meiwan Chen","Yuee Cai","Wenji Zhang","Zirong Chen","Zhi Shi","Chengwei He"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s84035","first_seen_on":"2016-01-06T21:59:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2013"],"journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1459412470,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=25135"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=28535","pmcid":"PMC4708214","pmid":"26792989","pubdate":"2016-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Recent insights into the biological activities and&nbsp;drug delivery systems of tanshinones","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-insights-biological-activities-drug-delivery-systems-tanshinones-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7471181,"mean":6.4836306053357,"rank":5391280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1817474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7471181,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308978,"mean":9.2367583412355,"rank":195932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":94705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308978,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1703,"mean":2.586,"rank":1227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1703,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":2.0567733333333,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
