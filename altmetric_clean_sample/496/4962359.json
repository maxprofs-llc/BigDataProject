As information regarding the prevalence and genotyping of G. intestinalis infection in dairy cattle in northwestern China is limited, 2945 feces samples from 1224 dairy cattle in Gansu Province and from 1614 in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NXHAR) were examined between December 2012 and March 2014. The overall prevalence of G. intestinalis was 3.63% (107\/2945), with 2.63% and 4.38% in Gansu and NXHAR, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed region, age and season to be significant risk factors for G. intestinalis infection. Assemblage analysis identified 106 assemblage E and one assemblage A at the triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) locus in the present study. Intra-variations were also detected at tpi, glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and beta giardin (bg) loci within assemblage E, showing seven, three and five new subtypes, respectively. Moreover, thirteen new multilocus genotypes (MLGs E20-E32) were observed in assemblage E. Effective strategies and measures should be taken to prevent and control giardiasis in Gansu and NXHAR.
