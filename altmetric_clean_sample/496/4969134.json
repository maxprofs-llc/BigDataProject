The molecular mechanism for this association remains poorly defined. Here we report in human and rodent tissues that elevated glucose, as found in MetS\/T2DM, and oligomeric \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide, thought to be a key mediator of AD, coordinately increase neuronal Ca(2+) and nitric oxide (NO) in an NMDA receptor-dependent manner. The increase in NO results in S-nitrosylation of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), thus inhibiting insulin and A\u03b2 catabolism as well as hyperactivating mitochondrial fission machinery. Consequent elevation in A\u03b2 levels and compromise in mitochondrial bioenergetics result in dysfunctional synaptic plasticity and synapse loss in cortical and hippocampal neurons. The NMDA receptor antagonist memantine attenuates these effects. Our studies show that redox-mediated posttranslational modification of brain proteins link A\u03b2 and hyperglycaemia to cognitive dysfunction in MetS\/T2DM and AD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Mohd Waseem Akhtar","Sara Sanz-Blasco","Nima Dolatabadi","James Parker","Kevin Chon","Michelle S.
