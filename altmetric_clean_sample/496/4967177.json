Successful therapy requires rapid initiation of treatment and ongoing assessment of adequacy of response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002203","authors":["Goldenberg, D L","Cohen, A S"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-07T20:30:20+00:00","issns":["0002-9343"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1370120640,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/769545?dopt=AbstractPlus"],"pmid":"769545","pubdate":"1976-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Acute infectious arthritis.

The Washington University Emergency Medicine Journal Club podcast provides an excellent way to keep up with the medical literature, improve patient care, and increase understanding of evidence-based medicine.   Each month we ask a clinical or operational question pertinent to the practice of emergency medicine.  We then discuss the four articles most relevant to that question in an attempt to determine the most evidence-based approach to patient care."}}]}}
