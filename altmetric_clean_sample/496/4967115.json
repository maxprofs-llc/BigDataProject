Group A had no fluid or solids for at least four hours before the injection (499 cases); group B were allowed unlimited food and fluid (501 cases). Both groups were comparable in all other respects and all were given the non-ionic contrast medium iopamidol (300 mg l\/ml).\nThe incidence of acute complications was 3.5%. There was, however, no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.29). Late adverse reactions were seen in 3.9% patients. There was again no difference between the two groups (p = 0.33). No serious or life threatening complications occurred.\nRestriction of food and fluid before intravascular injection of contrast medium does not reduce the number of adverse side effects. For reasons of patient comfort and compliance, and to achieve adequate hydration, the patient should not fast before injection of contrast.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f61000884a","authors":["Wagner, H J","Evers, J P","Hoppe, M","Klose, K J"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-2007-1015444","first_seen_on":"2016-01-07T20:25:25+00:00","issns":["1438-9029","1438-9010"],"issue":"5","journal":"R\u00f6Fo - Fortschritte auf dem Gebiet der R\u00f6ntgenstrahlen und der bildgebenden Verfahren","last_mentioned_on":1400272260,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9198507"],"pmid":"9198507","pubdate":"1997-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","diagnosticimaging","nuclearmedicine"],"title":"[Must the patient fast before intravascular injection of a non-ionic contrast medium?
