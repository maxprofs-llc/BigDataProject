The material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, UV\/Vis spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was observed from transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) analysis that the reported synthesis route allows the production of SrCO\u2083-Sr(OH)\u2082 nanoparticles with particle size below 100 nm which were embedded within a semiconducting polypyrrole matrix (PPy). The SrCO\u2083-Sr(OH)\u2082 and SrCO\u2083-Sr(OH)\u2082\/PPy nanocomposites were tested in the photodegradation of MB dye under visible light irradiation. Also, the effects of MB dye initial concentration and the catalyst load on photodegradation efficiency were studied and discussed. Under the same conditions, the efficiency of photodegradation of MB employing the SrCO\u2083-Sr(OH)\u2082\/PPy nanocomposite increases as compared with that obtained employing the SrCO\u2083-Sr(OH)\u2082 nanocomposite.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bc","authors":["Alfredo M\u00e1rquez-Herrera"],"doi":"10.3390\/ma9010030","first_seen_on":"2016-01-06T19:34:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1996-1944"],"issue":"1","journal":"Materials (1996-1944)","last_mentioned_on":1452108831,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/9\/1\/30"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/9\/1\/30\/pdf","pmid":"28787830","pubdate":"2016-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Facile Synthesis of SrCO3-Sr(OH)2\/PPy Nanocomposite with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity under Visible Light","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facile-synthesis-srco3sroh2ppy-nanocomposite-enhanced-photocatalytic-activity-under-visible-light-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6912770,"mean":6.208179930211,"rank":3391285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2015961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6912770,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302182,"mean":9.0653247358369,"rank":155553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":113690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302182,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":629,"mean":1.0072993630573,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":629,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.0734375,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
