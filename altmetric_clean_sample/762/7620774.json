Combining gene therapy with chemotherapeutics in a single delivery system is more effective than individual delivery systems carrying either gene or drug. In this work, we developed folate (FA) receptor targeted magnetic-mesoporous silica nanoparticles for the co-delivery of VEGF shRNA and doxorubicin (DOX) (denoted as M-MSN(DOX)\/PEI-FA\/VEGF shRNA). Our data showed that M-MSN(DOX)\/PEI-FA could strongly condense VEGF shRNA at weight ratios of 30:1, and possesses higher stability against DNase I digestion and sodium heparin. In vitro antitumor activity assays revealed that HeLa cell growth was significantly inhibited. The intracellular accumulation of DOX by confocal microscopy and fluorescence spectrophotometry showed that M-MSN(DOX)\/PEI-FA were more easily taken up than non-targeted M-MSN(DOX). Quantitative PCR and ELISA data revealed that M-MSN\/PEI-FA\/VEGF shRNA induced a significant decrease in VEGF expression as compared to cells treated with either the control or other complexes. The invasion and migration phenotypes of the HUVECS were significantly decrease after co-culture with MSN\/PEI-FA\/VEGF shRNA nanocomplexes-treated HeLa cells. The approach provides a potential strategy to treat cancer by a singular nanoparticle delivery system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Li, Ting Ting","Shen, Xue","Geng, Yue","Chen, Zhongyuan","Li, Li","Li, Shun","Yang, Hong","Wu, Chunhui","Zeng, Hongjuan","Liu, Yi Yao"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.6b02963","first_seen_on":"2016-05-19T10:24:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-8252","1944-8244"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1463653427,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27191965?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27191965","pubdate":"2016-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
