Biopsy GS under-estimates the actual GS at radical prostatectomy in a significant number of patients due to samplingartifact. The aim of this study was to identify markers that are differentially expressed in Gleason grade 3 (GG3) tumor glands embedded in GS 4 + 3 = 7 and GS 3 + 3 = 6 prostate cancer using laser capture microdissection and RNA sequencing.GG3 tumor glands embedded in nine GS 3 + 3 = 6 and nine GS 4 + 3 = 7 prostate cancers were isolated by laser capture microdissection of frozen radical prostatectomy specimens. After RNA amplification and RNA sequencing, differentially expressed genes in both GG3 components were identified by a 2log fold change > 1.0 and p-value < 0.05. We applied immunohistochemistry on a tissue micro-array representing 481 radical prostatectomy samples for further validation on protein level.A total of 501 genes were up-regulated and 421 down-regulated in GG3 glands embedded in GS 4 + 3 = 7 as compared to GS 3 + 3 = 6 prostate cancer. We selected HELLS, ZIC2 and ZIC5 genes for further validation. ZIC5 mRNA was up-regulated 17 fold (p = 8.4E-07), ZIC2 8 fold (p = 1.3E-05) and HELLS 2 fold (p = 0.006) in GG3 glands derived from GS 4 + 3 = 7. HELLS expression of \u2265 1% occurred in 10% GS < 7, 17% GS 7 and 43% GS >7 prostate cancer (p < 0.001). Using a cut-off of \u2265 1%, protein expression of ZIC5 was present in 28% GS < 7, 43% GS 7 and 57% GS > 7 cancer (p < 0.001). ZIC2 was neither associated with GS nor outcome in our validation set. HELLS was independently predictive for biochemical-recurrence after radical prostatectomy (HR 2.3; CI 1.5-3.6; p < 0.01).In conclusion, HELLS and ZIC5 might be promising candidate markers for selection of biopsy GS 6 prostate cancer being at risk for up-grading at prostatectomy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Hoogland, A Marije","B\u00f6ttcher, Ren\u00e9","Verhoef, Esther","Jenster, Guido","van Leenders, Geert J L H"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.9344","first_seen_on":"2016-05-19T10:24:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"25","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1463653474,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27191985?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27191985","pubdate":"2014-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Gene-expression analysis of gleason grade 3 tumor glands embedded in low- and high-risk prostate cancer","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geneexpression-analysis-gleason-grade-3-tumor-glands-embedded-low-highrisk-prostate-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7719347,"mean":6.622418915792,"rank":6678288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7719347,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269213,"mean":11.505577039656,"rank":224684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269213,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7815,"mean":2.9112807780906,"rank":5545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7815,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":6.7266741573034,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
