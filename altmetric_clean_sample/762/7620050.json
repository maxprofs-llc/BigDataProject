Statistical analyses used a random intercept Poisson regression model at Census Output Area (COA) level (mean population 310). Models were adjusted for age, sex, deprivation and tobacco sales.\nAnalysing 34,963 respiratory hospital admissions in 4656 COAs within 250-2500m of a site, there were no significant trends using pre-defined distance bands of >250-750m, >750-1500m and >1500-2500m. Using a continuous measure of distance, there was a small non-statistically significant (p=0.054) association with total respiratory admissions corresponding to a 1.5% (95% CI: 0.0-2.9%) decrease in risk if moving from 251m to 501m. There were no significant associations for subgroups of respiratory infections, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nThis national study does not provide evidence for increased risks of respiratory hospital admissions in those living beyond 250m of an outdoor composting area perimeter. Further work using better measures of exposure and exploring associations with symptoms and disease prevalence, especially in vulnerable groups, is recommended to support regulatory approaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b5b","authors":["Douglas, Philippa","Bakolis, Ioannis","Fecht, Daniela","Pearson, Clare","Leal Sanchez, Maria","Kinnersley, Rob","de Hoogh, Kees","Hansell, Anna L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijheh.2016.03.004","endpage":"379","first_seen_on":"2016-05-19T10:06:58+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1618-131X","14384639"],"issue":"4-5","journal":"International Journal of Hygiene & Environmental Health","last_mentioned_on":1465482357,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27061055","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1438463916300220"],"pmid":"27061055","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"372","subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Respiratory hospital admission risk near large composting facilities","type":"article","volume":"219","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/respiratory-hospital-admission-risk-near-large-composting-facilities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7876706,"mean":6.669712343671,"rank":3551562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4246834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7876706,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270218,"mean":11.513041784935,"rank":116628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":149044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270218,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":408,"mean":4.5734004914005,"rank":262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":408,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.425,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
