The present work shows that L-phenylalanine is a competitive inhibitor of human brain pyruvate kinase and phenylpyruvic acid is an inhibitor of human brain hexokinase. The enzymes have approximately the same K(i) for these inhibitors in adult and in fetal human brain. However, in the fetal human brain the absolute activities for both enzymes are less than 10 per cent of those found in the adult. Thus, the fetal brain enzymes may be more vulnerable to inhibition by these compounds in the phenylketonurics. The inhibition of human brain pyruvate kinase and hexokinase by L-phenylalanine and phenylpyruvic acid may have a role in the brain damage in phenylketonurics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["George Weber","Weber, G"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-19T13:14:36+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"4","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1463663662,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/63\/4\/1365","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/5260939","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC223473"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/63\/4\/1365.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC223473","pmid":"5260939","pubdate":"1969-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Inhibition of human brain pyruvate kinase and hexokinase by phenylalanine and phenylpyruvate: possible relevance to phenylketonuric brain damage.","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-human-brain-pyruvate-kinase-hexokinase-phenylalanine-phenylpyruvate-possible-relevance-ph"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7719347,"mean":6.622418915792,"rank":1881324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4811889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7719347,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269213,"mean":11.5054955054,"rank":86393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":179100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269213,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44749,"mean":22.87002359882,"rank":20951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":15073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44749,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":927,"mean":70.268328293737,"rank":613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":927,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Pyruvate kinase","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=721043569#altmetric_citation_20ff4866-ad20-47e6-b711-5c1021519625","license":"public","citation_ids":[7627188,7627188,7627188],"posted_on":"2016-05-19T13:14:22+00:00","summary":"Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme involved in the final, rate-limiting step of glycolysis.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=508739","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Jlivschitz12","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Jlivschitz12"}}]}}
