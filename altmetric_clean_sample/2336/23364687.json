The highest incidence of malaria in the world is South East Asia. India is most affected country followed by Indonesia and Myanmar. The prevalence of malaria varies according to geographical region. Diagnosis of malaria infection has been underestimated. Here, we report a case of under-diagnosed complicated vivax malaria in one-yr-old child in 2016. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can reduce both morbidity and mortality in complicated malaria infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f0c","authors":["Agrawal, Sonu"],"first_seen_on":"2017-08-02T10:02:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1735-7020"],"issue":"2","journal":"Iranian Journal of Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1501668158,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28761494?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28761494","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Underdiagnosed Complicated Plasmodium vivax Malaria in a Child: Need to Think.","type":"article","volume":"12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":7188647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174899,"mean":11.744002618669,"rank":143046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174899,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":3.8213768115942,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MalariaPapers\/statuses\/892687072611512320","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23364687],"posted_on":"2017-08-02T10:02:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Malaria Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/633328476070785024\/zGKHLt0g_normal.png","description":"I'm a bot tweeting papers about malaria as they appear on PubMed (& now preprints on BioRxiv). \n\nRun by @theosanderson.","id_on_source":"MalariaPapers","tweeter_id":"3428446343","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"892687072611512320"}]}}
