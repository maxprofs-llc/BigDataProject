It contains data pertaining to more than 435,000 total operations. The most recent biannual feedback report to participants (Spring 2017, Report of the Twenty-Sixth Harvest) included analysis of data submitted from 127 hospitals in North America. That represents nearly all centers performing pediatric and congenital heart operations in the United States and Canada. As an unparalleled platform for assessment of outcomes and for quality improvement activities in the subspecialty of surgery for pediatric and congenital heart disease, the STS CHSD continues to be a primary data source for clinical investigations and for research and innovations related to quality measurement. In 2016, several major original publications reported analyses of data in the CHSD pertaining to various processes of care, including assessment of variation across centers and associations between specific practices, patient characteristics, and outcomes. Additional publications reported the most recent development, evaluation, and application of metrics for quality measurement and reporting of pediatric and congenital heart operation outcomes and center level performance. Use of the STS CHSD for outcomes research and for quality measurement continues to expand as database participation has grown to include nearly all centers in North America, and the available wealth of data in the database continues to grow. This article reviews outcomes research and quality improvement articles published in 2016 that are based on STS CHSD data.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Jacobs, Marshall L.","Jacobs, Jeffrey P.","Hill, Kevin D.","Hornik, Christoph","O\u2019Brien, Sean M.","Pasquali, Sara K.","Vener, David","Kumar, S.
