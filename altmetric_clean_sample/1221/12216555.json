To better understand the physiological functions of Mh-ACO1 and Mh-ACO2, two hairpin-type siRNA expression vectors targeting both the Mh-ACO1 and Mh-ACO2 were constructed and incorporated into the banana genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The generation of Mh-ACO1 and Mh-ACO2 RNAi transgenic banana plants was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. To gain insights into the functional diversity and complexity between Mh-ACO1 and Mh-ACO2, transcriptome sequencing of banana fruits using the Illumina next-generation sequencer was performed. A total of 32,093,976 reads, assembled into 88,031 unigenes for 123,617 transcripts were obtained. Significantly enriched Gene Oncology (GO) terms and the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with GO annotation were 'catalytic activity' (1327, 56.4%), 'heme binding' (65, 2.76%), 'tetrapyrrole binding' (66, 2.81%), and 'oxidoreductase activity' (287, 12.21%). Real-time RT-PCR was further performed with mRNAs from both peel and pulp of banana fruits in Mh-ACO1 and Mh-ACO2 RNAi transgenic plants. The results showed that expression levels of genes related to ethylene signaling in ripening banana fruits were strongly influenced by the expression of genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Yan Xia","Xia, Yan","Kuan, Chi","Chiu, Chien-Hsiang","Chen, Xiao-Jing","Do, Yi-Yin","Huang, Pung-Ling"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms17101632","first_seen_on":"2016-09-26T10:07:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"10","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1475240470,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/10\/1632?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27681726"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/10\/1632\/pdf","pmid":"27681726","pubdate":"2016-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1632","title":"Global Transcriptomic Analysis of Targeted Silencing of Two Paralogous ACC Oxidase Genes in Banana","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/global-transcriptomic-analysis-targeted-silencing-two-paralogous-acc-oxidase-genes-banana"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":6414646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253156,"mean":12.695982619343,"rank":177205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":45249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253156,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5477,"mean":2.3934623813002,"rank":3192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5477,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":324,"mean":2.4717399380805,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":324,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rnomics\/statuses\/780348027999444992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12216555],"posted_on":"2016-09-26T10:07:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Fabrice Leclerc","url":"http:\/\/about.me\/leclercfabrice","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/461944449832984577\/OFZs5M7c_normal.png","description":"#RNomics, #RNA biology, RNA #bioinformatics, #RNA_World & #evolution, technologies & resources, daily papers: http:\/\/bit.ly\/HaycPM & http:\/\/bit.ly\/18cyMMK","id_on_source":"rnomics","tweeter_id":"177684507","geo":{"lt":46,"ln":2,"country":"FR"},"followers":1984},"tweet_id":"780348027999444992"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/transcriptomes\/statuses\/781841314799243264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12216555],"posted_on":"2016-09-30T13:01:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Transcriptomes","url":"http:\/\/davetang.org\/muse\/2015\/01\/31\/transcriptome-feed-using-r\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/561190761790574593\/2j6U4lnz_normal.png","description":"A transcriptome feed made using #Rstats.
