Mortality resulting from longer LOS has important regulatory implications for hospital and transplant programs. Which recipients are at risk of prolonged LOS and its effect on mortality are unclear. Frailty is a novel preoperative predictor of poor KT outcomes including delayed graft function, early hospital readmission, immunosuppression intolerance, and mortality.\nWe used registry-augmented hybrid methods, a novel approach to risk adjustment, to adjust for LOS risk factors from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (n = 74,859) and tested whether (1) frailty, measured immediately before KT in a novel cohort (n = 589), was associated with LOS (LOS: negative binomial regression; LOS \u22652 weeks: logistic regression) and (2) whether frailty modified the association between LOS and mortality (interaction term analysis).\nFrailty was independently associated with longer LOS [relative risk = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.29; P = 0.01] and LOS \u22652 weeks (odds ratio = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.06-2.33; P = 0.03) after accounting for registry-based risk factors, including delayed graft function. Frailty also attenuated the association between LOS and mortality (nonfrail hazard rate = 1.55 95% CI: 1.30-1.86; P < 0.001; frail hazard rate = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79-1.19, P = 0.80; P for interaction = 0.001).\nFrail KT recipients are more likely to experience a longer LOS. Longer LOS among nonfrail recipients may be a marker of increased mortality risk. Frailty is a measure of physiologic reserve that may be an important clinical marker of longer surgical LOS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a30","authors":["McAdams-DeMarco, Mara A.","King, Elizabeth A.","Luo, Xun","Haugen, Christine","DiBrito, Sandra","Shaffer, Ashton","Kucirka, Lauren M.","Desai, Niraj M.","Dagher, Nabil N.","Lonze, Bonnie E.","Montgomery, Robert A.","Walston, Jeremy","Segev, Dorry L."],"doi":"10.1097\/sla.0000000000002025","first_seen_on":"2016-09-26T08:01:03+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1528-1140","0003-4932"],"journal":"Annals of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1475673805,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsofsurgery\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Frailty,_Length_of_Stay,_and_Mortality_in_Kidney.96383.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsofsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Frailty,_Length_of_Stay,_and_Mortality_in_Kidney.96383.pdf","pmid":"27655240","pubdate":"2016-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Frailty, Length of Stay, and Mortality in Kidney Transplant Recipients","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsofsurgery\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Frailty,_Length_of_Stay,_and_Mortality_in_Kidney.96383.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frailty-length-stay-mortality-kidney-transplant-recipients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":4.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7483631,"mean":6.488280441707,"rank":1515801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5958063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7483631,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239781,"mean":12.430702835933,"rank":68995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":170231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239781,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4009,"mean":9.5909396207585,"rank":1385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4009,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":28.079723404255,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":4}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnnalsofSurgery\/statuses\/780316181055942656","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12214883],"posted_on":"2016-09-26T08:00:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Annals of Surgery","url":"http:\/\/www.annalsofsurgery.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1867414637\/Annals_of_Surgery_Cover_normal.jpg","description":"Annals of Surgery, the world's most referenced surgery journal, is committed to discovering & disseminating the best of surgical science #VisualAbstract","id_on_source":"AnnalsofSurgery","tweeter_id":"402274600","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":20690},"tweet_id":"780316181055942656"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lyndsay_pearce1\/statuses\/780359669915258880","license":"public","citation_ids":[12214883],"posted_on":"2016-09-26T10:53:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Lyndsay Pearce","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/780716566333812736\/fJ-rVLie_normal.jpg","description":"Mummy & Surgical trainee NW deanery interest in emergency, trauma, colorectal.
