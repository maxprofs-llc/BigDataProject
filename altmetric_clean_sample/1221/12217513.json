However, effective dosing or scheduling of proton pump inhibitors for the prevention of delayed bleeding after endoscopic resection remains unclear.\nOne hundred sixty-six patients with gastric adenoma or early gastric cancer were enrolled. After an endoscopic procedure, each subject was randomly assigned to 40\u2009mg every 24\u2009h (standard dose group) or 40\u2009mg every 12\u2009h (double dose group) of intravenous pantoprazole for 48\u2009h. Second-look endoscopy was performed on day 2 after endoscopic resection to compare signs of re-bleeding and ulcer status between the 2 groups.\nEighty-one patients of the standard dose group and 81 of the double dose group were analyzed. There were no significant differences in the incidence of delayed bleeding events (1.3% vs. 6.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.21) and bleeding ulcer at the second-look endoscopy (6.2% vs. 3.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.69) between standard and double dose groups. There was no other significant variables associated with delayed bleeding or bleeding ulcer on second-look endoscopy.\nIntravenous pantoprazole 40\u2009mg every 24\u2009h or 12\u2009h for 2\u2009days after endoscopic resection were equally effective for the prevention of delayed bleeding.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db7","authors":["Jung, Sung Woo","Kim, Seung Young","Choe, Jung Wan","Hyun, Jong Jin","Jung, Yong Kul","Koo, Ja Seol","Yim, Hyung Joon","Lee, Sang Woo"],"doi":"10.1111\/jgh.13597","first_seen_on":"2016-09-26T11:13:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1440-1746"],"journal":"Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1474956894,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgh.13597\/pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgh.13597\/pdf","pmid":"27637734","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Standard and double dose intravenous proton pump inhibitor injections for prevention of bleeding after endoscopic resection","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":28,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":28},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":326937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":8111550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252978,"mean":12.700712357249,"rank":18352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":234542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252978,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1259,"mean":4.3861971383148,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":1237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1259,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":5.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Standard and Double Dose Pantoprazole Equally Effective","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=28057801948&p=1pl&v=1&x=EUnsxO2lpeHjDGcVlNM79g","license":"public","citation_ids":[12217513,12217513],"posted_on":"2016-09-23T16:45:58+00:00","summary":"FRIDAY, Sept. 23, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- For patients with gastric adenoma or early gastric cancer, standard dose or double dose intravenous pantoprazole for 48 hours is equally effective for prevention of delayed bleeding after endoscopic\u2026","author":{"name":"Physician's Briefing","url":"http:\/\/www.physiciansbriefing.com","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/372\/normal\/logo.png?1436525474"}},{"title":"Standard and Double Dose Pantoprazole Equally Effective","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=28058450310&p=1pl&v=1&x=x0mnKjHgCdHTYCoOpvnYXw","license":"public","citation_ids":[12217513,12217513],"posted_on":"2016-09-23T18:02:04+00:00","summary":"FRIDAY, Sept. 23, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- For patients with gastric adenoma or early gastric cancer, standard dose or double dose intravenous pantoprazole for 48 hours is equally effective for prevention of delayed bleeding after endoscopic\u2026","author":{"name":"Doctors Lounge","url":"http:\/\/www.doctorslounge.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/301\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-02-02_at_15.39.07.png?1454427565"}},{"title":"Standard vs Double Dose Pantoprazole","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=28085349454&p=1pl&v=1&x=7-2mAAPMBW_EQRs6m676yg","license":"public","citation_ids":[12217513,12217513],"posted_on":"2016-09-26T04:00:00+00:00","summary":"Advertisement For the study, Sung Woo Jung, M.D., from the University College of Medicine in Seoul, South Korea, and colleagues enrolled 166 patients with gastric adenoma or early gastric cancer.","author":{"name":"Physician's Weekly","url":"http:\/\/www.physiciansweekly.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/553\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-01-06_at_16.43.49.png?1452098646"}},{"title":"Standard vs. Double Dose Pantoprazole Assessed for Gastric Adenoma","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=28091996829&p=1pl&v=1&x=85HrFfV5FUVAIWnKiLvcow","license":"public","citation_ids":[12217513,12217513],"posted_on":"2016-09-27T06:14:54+00:00","summary":"This article originally appeared here.
