Tracer uptake is known to be dependent from lymph node integrity and activity of macrophages. The aim of this study was to assess whether radioactivity of the tracer can predict sentinel lymph node metastases. Furthermore, a potential association with Ki-67 index was examined. Non-invasive prediction of lymph node metastases could lead to a further decrease of morbidity.\nWe retrospectively analyzed patients with primary breast cancer who underwent surgery at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the University Hospital of Cologne between 2012 and 2013. Injection of radioactive tracer was done a day before surgery in the department of Nuclear Medicine. Clinical data and radioactivity of the sentinel node measured the day before and intraoperatively were abstracted from patient's files.\nOf 246 patients, 64 patients had at least one, five patients had two and one patient had three positive sentinel lymph nodes. Occurrence of sentinel lymph node metastases was not associated with preoperative tracer activity (p\u00a0=\u00a00,319), intraoperative tracer activity of first sentinel node (p\u00a0=\u00a00,086) or with loss of tracer activity until operation (p\u00a0=\u00a00,909). There was no correlation between preoperative Ki-67 index and occurrence of lymph node metastases (p\u00a0=\u00a00,403).\nIn our cohort, there was no correlation between radioactivity and sentinel node metastases. Tracer uptake might not only be influenced by lymph node metastases and does not predict metastatic lymph node involvement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006cfb","authors":["Thangarajah, Fabinshy","Malter, Wolfram","Hamacher, Stefanie","Schmidt, Matthias","Kr\u00e4mer, Stefan","Mallmann, Peter","Kirn, Verena"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.breast.2016.09.003","endpage":"91","first_seen_on":"2016-09-26T10:32:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-3080","09609776"],"journal":"The Breast","last_mentioned_on":1475139647,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27665485?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0960977616301643"],"pmid":"27665485","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"87","subjects":["neoplasms","endocrinology"],"title":"Predictors of sentinel lymph node metastases in breast cancer-radioactivity and Ki-67","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictors-sentinel-lymph-node-metastases-breast-cancerradioactivity-ki67"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":6109052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2038717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253121,"mean":12.696688369153,"rank":163689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":75903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253121,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":626,"mean":3.35768,"rank":381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":626,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.528125,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/780354381820538880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12216968],"posted_on":"2016-09-26T10:32:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":724},"tweet_id":"780354381820538880"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/clinicallibrar1\/statuses\/781418435108605952","license":"public","citation_ids":[12216968],"posted_on":"2016-09-29T09:00:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Clinical Breast News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/770650005652639744\/5ca0b6Yd_normal.jpg","description":"A news, views & info feed on breast surgery for busy clinicians.
