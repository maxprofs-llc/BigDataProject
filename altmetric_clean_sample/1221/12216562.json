The protein paired-related homeobox 1 (Prx1) labels migrating PPF cells and stimulates expression of transcription factor 4 (Tcf4), a novel MCT marker that controls morphogenesis of the fetal diaphragm. We hypothesized that diaphragmatic Prx1 and Tcf4 expression is decreased in the nitrofen-induced CDH model.\nTime-mated rats were exposed to either nitrofen or vehicle on gestational day 9 (D9). Fetal diaphragms were microdissected on D13, D15, and D18, and divided into control and nitrofen-exposed specimens. Gene expression levels of Prx1 and Tcf4 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Immunofluorescence double staining for Prx1 and Tcf4 was performed to evaluate protein expression and localization.\nRelative mRNA expression of Prx1 and Tcf4 was significantly downregulated in PPFs (D13), developing diaphragms (D15) and fully muscularized diaphragms (D18) of nitrofen-exposed fetuses compared to controls. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed markedly diminished Prx1 and Tcf4 expression in diaphragmatic MCT of nitrofen-exposed fetuses on D13, D15, and D18 compared to controls.\nDecreased expression of Prx1 and Tcf4 in the fetal diaphragm may cause defects in the PPF-derived MCT, leading to development of CDH in the nitrofen model.\nLevel 2c (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd6","authors":["Takahashi, Toshiaki","Zimmer, Julia","Friedmacher, Florian","Puri, Prem"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpedsurg.2016.09.007","first_seen_on":"2016-09-26T10:07:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1531-5037","00223468"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Surgery (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1474884822,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27665494?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27665494","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pediatrics"],"title":"Expression of Prx1 and Tcf4 is decreased in the diaphragmatic muscle connective tissue of nitrofen-induced congenital diaphragmatic hernia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-prx1-tcf4-decreased-diaphragmatic-muscle-connective-tissue-nitrofeninduced-congenital-dia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":4259399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3958817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252953,"mean":12.697216689332,"rank":128775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":114810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252953,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2077,"mean":2.1421955684008,"rank":812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2077,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":2.8947058823529,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
