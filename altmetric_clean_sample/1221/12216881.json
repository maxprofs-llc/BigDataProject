Despite being a first-line testing tool for heterogeneous inherited disorders, whole-exome sequencing has not yet been evaluated in dystonia diagnostics. We set up a pilot study to address the yield of whole-exome sequencing for early-onset generalized dystonia, a disease subtype enriched for monogenic causation.\nClinical whole-exome sequencing coupled with bioinformatics analysis and detailed phenotyping of mutation carriers was performed on 16 consecutive cases with genetically undefined early-onset generalized dystonia. Candidate pathogenic variants were validated and tested for cosegregation. The whole-exome approach was complemented by analyzing 2 mutated yet unestablished causative genes in another 590 dystonia cases.\nWhole-exome sequencing detected clinically relevant mutations of known dystonia-related genes in 6 generalized dystonia cases (37.5%), among whom 3 had novel variants. Reflecting locus heterogeneity, identified unique variants were distributed over 5 genes (GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A, ANO3, ADCY5), of which only 1 (ANO3) was mutated recurrently. Three genes (GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A) were associated with isolated generalized dystonia, whereas 2 (ANO3, ADCY5) gave rise to combined dystonia-myoclonus phenotypes. Follow-up screening of ANO3 and ADCY5 revealed a set of distinct variants of interest, the pathogenicity of which was supported by bioinformatics testing and cosegregation work.\nOur study identified whole-exome sequencing as an effective strategy for molecular diagnosis of early-onset generalized dystonia and offers insights into the heterogeneous genetic architecture of this condition. Furthermore, it provides confirmatory evidence for a dystonia-relevant role of ANO3 and ADCY5, both of which likely associate with a broader spectrum of dystonic expressions than previously thought. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ecf","authors":["Zech, Michael","Boesch, Sylvia","Jochim, Angela","Weber, Sandrina","Meindl, Tobias","Schormair, Barbara","Wieland, Thomas","Lunetta, Christian","Sansone, Valeria","Messner, Michael","Mueller, Joerg","Ceballos\u2010Baumann, Andres","Strom, Tim M.","Colombo, Roberto","Poewe, Werner","Haslinger, Bernhard","Winkelmann, Juliane"],"doi":"10.1002\/mds.26808","first_seen_on":"2016-09-26T10:27:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1531-8257"],"journal":"Movement Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1476311026,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mds.26808\/abstract;jsessionid=06EAA057267BA3DEFC06FD0870E5D81A.f04t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mds.26808\/abstract;jsessionid=90F15D84DFA65B63DBD7EEEDF917E1E2.f01t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mds.26808\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mds.26808\/pdf","pmid":"27666935","pubdate":"2016-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Clinical exome sequencing in early\u2010onset generalized dystonia and large\u2010scale resequencing follow\u2010up","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-exome-sequencing-earlyonset-generalized-dystonia-largescale-resequencing-followup"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7529066,"mean":6.5069445313556,"rank":3887470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2106008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7529066,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240500,"mean":12.434680701375,"rank":132449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":83669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240500,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2064,"mean":5.3288473097431,"rank":1381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2064,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":2.7113636363636,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
