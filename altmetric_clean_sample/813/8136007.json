Addition and intensification of total body irradiation (TBI) to the preparative lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen in sequential trials improved objective partial and complete response (CR) rates. Here, we evaluated the importance of adding TBI to the adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in a randomized fashion.\nA total of 101 patients with metastatic melanoma, including 76 patients with M1c disease, were randomly assigned to receive nonmyeloablative chemotherapy with or without 1,200 cGy TBI before transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphcytes. Primary end points were CR rate (as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.0) and overall survival (OS). Clinical and laboratory data were analyzed for correlates of response.\nCR rates were 24% in both groups (12 of 50 v 12 of 51), and OS was also similar (median OS, 38.2 v 36.6 months; hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.91; P = .71). Thrombotic microangiopathy was an adverse event unique to the TBI arm and occurred in 13 of 48 treated patients. With a median potential follow-up of 40.9 months, only one of 24 patients who achieved a CR recurred.\nAdoptive cell transfer can mediate durable complete regressions in 24% of patients with metastatic melanoma, with median survival > 3 years. Results were similar using chemotherapy preparative regimens with or without addition of TBI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a18","authors":["Stephanie L. Goff","Mark E. Dudley","Deborah E.
