Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to estimate the risk of a low 5-min Apgar score (\u22646) associated with maternal education level, maternal age, marital status, primiparity, number of prenatal visits and mode of delivery (vaginal\/caesarean section).\nNearly 12 million records were analysed. Births from mothers with 0, 1-3, 4-7 and 8-11\u00a0years of education resulted in crude ORs for low 5-min Apgar score of 3.1, 2.2, 1.8 and 1.3, respectively (reference: \u226512\u00a0years of education). The crude OR for mothers aged \u226541\u00a0years (reference 21-34\u00a0years) was 1.4, but no risk was detected for those with \u226512\u00a0years of education and those who gave birth by caesarean section (OR 1.0 [95% confidence interval 0.9-1.2]). Generally, the risk of a low 5-min Apgar score was found to increase as maternal age moved away from 21 to 34\u00a0years (OR 1.1-1.7), and for mothers with the same characteristics, the risk of a low 5-min Apgar score was found to decrease markedly as education level increased (adjusted OR decreased from 2.6 to 1.2).\nMaternal education level is clearly associated with the risk of a low 5-min Apgar score.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033f2","authors":["N.K.O.
