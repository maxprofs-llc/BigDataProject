Background data: We have previously shown a decrease in the viability of RKCs, on incubation with GNPs irradiated with pulsed laser. This decrease in viability was concomitant to a reduction in GNP diameter size, and reflected the occurrence of subcellular toxic events. Methods: After incubation of RKCs with GNPs irradiated with 532\u2009nm pulsed laser (50\u2009mJ\/pulse energy, 5\u2009ns duration, and 10\u2009Hz repetition rate for 1, 3, and 5\u2009min), we studied the cell membrane integrity, the induction of apoptosis, and the occurrence of oxidative stress. We reported the changes induced on RKCs by GNPs irradiated with pulsed laser and those induced on the same cells and after the same time intervals by unirradiated GNPs; both were related to a negative control. Results: The decrease in viability of RKCs on incubation with GNPs irradiated with pulsed laser was shown to be mostly secondary to a cell membrane disruption, most probably related to the reduction in GNP diameter sizes. The oxidative stress exerted by smaller GNPs on RKCs, as well as the induction of apoptosis, seem to be tolerated by the RKCs. Conclusions: Irradiation of GNPs with pulsed laser, to elicit a plasmonic photothermal effect, reduces the GNPs' diameter. The smaller-sized GNPs may lead to lethal cell membrane disruption in healthy RKCs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032ff","authors":["SalehHazem M."],"doi":"10.1089\/pho.2013.3568","first_seen_on":"2014-06-09T02:09:01+00:00","issns":["1549-5418"],"issue":"6","journal":"Photomedicine & Laser Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1402254353,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/pho.2013.3568","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24905931"],"pmid":"24905931","pubdate":"2014-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Subcellular Toxicity of Gold Nanoparticles Irradiated with 532\u2009nm Pulsed Laser","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subcellular-toxicity-gold-nanoparticles-irradiated-532-nm-pulsed-laser"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4715844,"mean":5.6939646879715,"rank":2177398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2418856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4715844,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113621,"mean":7.9831061608873,"rank":46360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":63738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113621,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288,"mean":1.6704041811847,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.0611111111111,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":3,"Physics and Astronomy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Search_MD\/status\/475105740202328065","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2414445],"posted_on":"2014-06-07T02:43:30+00:00","author":{"name":"SearchMarketingMD","url":"http:\/\/www.searchmarketingmd.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1170825585\/twitter-bg_normal.gif","description":"Search Marketing MD specializes in marketing medical professionals online through SEO, Pay-Per-Click, Web Design, Social Media, Online Display Ads, Email & SMS.","id_on_source":"Search_MD","tweeter_id":"216880421","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":455},"tweet_id":"475105740202328065"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/raphavisses\/status\/475715353713340416","license":"datasift","rt":["StephenLeahy"],"citation_ids":[2414445],"posted_on":"2014-06-08T19:05:53+00:00","author":{"name":"(((Raphael Levy)))","url":"http:\/\/raphazlab.wordpress.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/747329347581685760\/ZIyLEyQ6_normal.jpg","description":"#Bionano #scicomm #oa #openscience French Scouse #Reviewer3 Also argentine tango, dadX3 and... orangettes","id_on_source":"raphavisses","tweeter_id":"140966030","geo":{"lt":53.41058,"ln":-2.97794,"country":"GB"},"followers":1058},"tweet_id":"475715353713340416"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/StephenLeahy\/status\/475351771221852160","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2414445],"posted_on":"2014-06-07T19:01:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Stephen Leahy","url":"https:\/\/stephenleahy.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/862750526219452416\/EW9EnrFO_normal.jpg","description":"International Environmental Journalist  | Award-win Author: Your Water Footprint | UN Global Media Prize for Climate  http:\/\/PayPal.Me\/StephenLeahy","id_on_source":"StephenLeahy","tweeter_id":"26593129","geo":{"lt":43.25011,"ln":-79.84963,"country":"CA"},"followers":4023},"tweet_id":"475351771221852160"}]}}
