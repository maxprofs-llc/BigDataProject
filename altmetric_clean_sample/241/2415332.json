Recent studies indicate that Stau1-bound messenger RNAs (mRNAs) mainly code for proteins involved in transcription and cell cycle control. Consistently, we report here that Stau1 abundance fluctuates through the cell cycle in HCT116 and U2OS cells: it is high from the S phase to the onset of mitosis and rapidly decreases as cells transit through mitosis. Stau1 down-regulation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex\/cyclosome (APC\/C). Stau1 interacts with the APC\/C co-activators Cdh1 and Cdc20 via its first 88 N-terminal amino acids. The importance of controlling Stau1(55) levels is underscored by the observation that its overexpression affects mitosis entry and impairs proliferation of transformed cells. Microarray analyses identified 275 Stau1(55)-bound mRNAs in prometaphase cells, an early mitotic step that just precedes Stau1 degradation. Interestingly, several of these mRNAs are more abundant in Stau1(55)-containing complexes in cells arrested in prometaphase than in asynchronous cells. Our results point out for the first time to the possibility that Stau1 participates in a mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression that is linked to cell cycle progression in cancer cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Karine Boulay","Mehdi Ghram","Wildriss Viranaicken","V\u00e9ronique Tr\u00e9panier","St\u00e9phanie Mollet","C\u00e9line Fr\u00e9china","Luc DesGroseillers"],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gku506","first_seen_on":"2014-06-09T03:14:13+00:00","issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1402335017,"links":["http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/06\/06\/nar.gku506.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24906885?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/06\/06\/nar.gku506.full.pdf","pmid":"24906885","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Cell cycle-dependent regulation of the RNA-binding protein Staufen1.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-cycledependent-regulation-rnabinding-protein-staufen1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2236285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2744586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124839,"mean":7.9237744116377,"rank":48362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":74737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124839,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8920,"mean":3.7885244982621,"rank":5383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8920,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":4.5679674796748,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
