In particular, we discuss targeting mutant signaling proteins, disrupting protein-protein interactions in cellular signaling networks, designing bivalent inhibitors of signaling proteins and identifying allosteric regulators of signaling enzymes. Over the past decade, great progress in the harvesting of chemical tools for basic research and clinical medicine has been made, but many challenges remain, and examples of exciting future targets are highlighted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Rong Huang","Isabel Martinez-Ferrando","Philip A Cole","Huang R","Martinez-Ferrando I","Cole PA"],"doi":"10.1038\/nsmb0610-646","endpage":"649","first_seen_on":"2014-06-06T16:07:55+00:00","issns":["1545-9993","1545-9985"],"issue":"6","journal":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1402070849,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nsmb\/journal\/v17\/n6\/fig_tab\/nsmb0610-646_F1.html"],"pmcid":"PMC3160762","pmid":"20520657","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"646","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Enhanced interrogation: emerging strategies for cell signaling inhibition","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhanced-interrogation-emerging-strategies-cell-signaling-inhibition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":964621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107323,"mean":7.6935225582827,"rank":72740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":24933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107323,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1632,"mean":5.8630275904353,"rank":1423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1632,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":10.436864864865,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
