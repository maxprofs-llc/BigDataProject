However, the production of A\u03b2 can be avoided by alternate cleavage of APP by \u03b1-and \u03b3-secretases. We hypothesized that cilostazol attenuates A\u03b2 production by increasing a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10)\/\u03b1-secretase activity via SIRT1-coupled retinoic acid receptor-\u03b2 (RAR\u03b2) activation in N2a cells expressing human APP Swedish mutation (N2aSwe). To evoke endogenous A\u03b2 overproduction, the culture medium was switched from medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to medium containing 1% FBS, and cells were cultured for 3\u223c24 hr. After depletion of FBS in media, N2aSwe cells showed increased accumulations of full-length APP (FL-APP) and A\u03b2 in a time-dependent manner (3-24 hr) in association with decreased ADAM10 protein expression. When pretreated with cilostazol (10-30 \u03bcM), FL-APP and A\u03b2 levels were significantly reduced, and ADAM10 and \u03b1-secretase activities were restored. Furthermore, the effect of cilostazol on ADAM10 expression was antagonized by pretreating Rp-cAMPS and sirtinol and by SIRT1-gene silencing. In the N2aSwe cells overexpressing the SIRT1 gene, ADAM10, and sAPP\u03b1 levels were significantly elevated. In addition, like all-trans retinoic acid, cilostazol enhanced the protein expressions of RAR\u03b2 and ADAM10, and the cilostazol-stimulated ADAM10 elevation was significantly attenuated by LE135 (a RAR\u03b2 inhibitor), sirtinol, and RAR\u03b2-gene silencing. In conclusion, cilostazol suppresses the accumulations of FL-APP and A\u03b2 by activating ADAM10 via the upregulation of SIRT1-coupled RAR\u03b2. \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d97","authors":["Lee HR","Shin HK","Park SY","Kim HY","Lee WS","Rhim BY","Hong KW","Kim CD","Lee, Hye Rin","Shin, Hwa Kyoung","Park, So Youn","Kim, Hye Young","Lee, Won Suk","Rhim, Byung Yong","Hong, Ki Whan","Kim, Chi Dae"],"doi":"10.1002\/jnr.23421","endpage":"1590","first_seen_on":"2014-06-09T19:48:36+00:00","issns":["1097-4547","0360-4012"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience Research","last_mentioned_on":1415290020,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24903973?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jnr.23421\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24903973"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jnr.23421\/pdf","pmid":"24903973","pubdate":"2014-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1581","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Cilostazol suppresses \u03b2-amyloid production by activating a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 via the upregulation of SIRT1-coupled retinoic acid receptor-\u03b2","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cilostazol-suppresses-%CE%B2amyloid-production-activating-disintegrin-metalloproteinase-10-via-upregulati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.232,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.232},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6309894,"mean":5.9755831472904,"rank":722494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5588253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6309894,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144028,"mean":7.6791972616247,"rank":20988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":123038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144028,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":681,"mean":3.1563794117647,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":681,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.5716666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
