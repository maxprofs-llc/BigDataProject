Methods: The effects of PGE2 at a range of concentrations on VEGF164 and caveolin-1 gene expressions were analyzed in cultured ovine amnion cells. IM absorption rate, amniotic fluid (AF) volume and PGE2 concentration in AF were determined in late gestation fetal sheep during control conditions, isovolumic fetal urine replacement (low IM absorption rate) or intra-amniotic fluid infusion (high IM absorption rate). Results: In ovine amnion cells, PGE2 induced dose and time dependent increases in VEGF164 mRNA levels and reduced caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels. VEGF receptor blockade abolished the caveolin-1 response while minimally affecting the VEGF response to PGE2. In sheep fetuses, urine replacement reduced amniotic PGE2 concentration by 58%, decreased IM absorption rate by half and doubled AF volume (P<0.01). Intra-amniotic fluid infusion increased IM absorption rate and AF volume (P<0.01) while amniotic PGE2 concentration was unchanged. Neither IM absorption rate nor AF volume correlated with amniotic PGE2 concentration under each experimental condition. Conclusion: Although PGE2 at micromolar concentrations induced dose dependent responses in VEGF and caveolin-1 gene expression in cultured amnion cells consistent with a role of PGE2 in activating VEGF to mediate AF transport across the amnion, amniotic PGE2 at physiologic nanomolar concentrations does not appear to regulate IM absorption rate or AF volume.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002212","authors":["Cecilia Y Cheung","Michael K Beardall","Debra F Anderson","Robert A Brace"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajpregu.00070.2014","first_seen_on":"2014-06-06T14:40:32+00:00","issns":["1522-1490"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Regulatory, Integrative & Comparative Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1402065512,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24898841"],"pmid":"24898841","pubdate":"2014-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Prostaglandin E2 Regulation of Amnion Cell Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Expression: Relationship with Intramembranous Absorption Rate in Fetal Sheep.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3569084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107327,"mean":7.7068248327528,"rank":82700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107327,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":928,"mean":4.434854368932,"rank":738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":928,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":6.9455454545455,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Loose_Lab_Rat\/status\/474923298988756992","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2410315],"posted_on":"2014-06-06T14:38:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Kelly A.
