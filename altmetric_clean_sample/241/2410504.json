Amblyomma americanum, the lone star tick, is considered the primary vector of E. chaffeensis, but this pathogen has been detected in other tick species, including the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. We hypothesized that the Arkansas strain of E. chaffeensis is infective to R. sanguineus, and used a novel PCR assay to test for acquisition of this pathogen by R. sanguineus and A. americanum ticks that were simultaneously fed on experimentally infected dogs. Although E. chaffeensis was not frequently detected in peripheral blood of these dogs, the pathogen was detected in both tick species and in canine lung, kidney, lymph node, bone marrow and frontal lobe samples. One dog (AFL) was maintained for several years, and ticks again acquired E. chaffeensis from this dog 566 days after intradermal inoculation with E. chaffeensis, but the pathogen was not detected in ticks fed on the same dog at 764 or 1086 days after the intradermal inoculation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fb","authors":["Ryan T Stoffel","Jennifer C McClure","Marion M Butcher","Gayle C Johnson","Will Roland","Chuanmin Cheng","Kamesh R Sirigireddy","Roman Ganta","Kirstin Boughan","S A Ewing","Roger W Stich","Stoffel RT","McClure JC","Butcher MM","Johnson GC","Roland W","Cheng C","Sirigireddy KR","Ganta R","Boughan K","Ewing SA","Stich RW"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vetmic.2014.04.017","endpage":"338","first_seen_on":"2014-06-06T15:53:09+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1873-2542","0378-1135","03781135"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1402069945,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24894131"],"pmid":"24894131","pubdate":"2014-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"334","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Experimental infection of Rhipicephalus sanguineus with Ehrlichia chaffeensis.","type":"article","volume":"172","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/experimental-infection-rhipicephalus-sanguineus-ehrlichia-chaffeensis-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6415368,"mean":5.87790452643,"rank":4740738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":949782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6415368,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135343,"mean":8.0321032052136,"rank":90213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":25886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135343,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1123,"mean":1.8503975044563,"rank":676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1123,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":0.99978947368421,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
