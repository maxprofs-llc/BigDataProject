The N-terminus of PABP is responsible for the high binding specificity and affinity to poly(A), whereas the C-terminus is known to stimulate PABP multimerization on poly(A). Here, we use single-molecule nanopore force spectroscopy to directly measure interactions between poly(A) and PABPs. Both electrical and biochemical results show that the C-C domain interaction between two consecutive PABPs promotes cooperative binding. Up to now, investigators have not been able to probe the detailed polarity configuration (i.e., the internal arrangement of two PABPs on a poly(A) streak in which the C-termini face toward or away from each other). Our nanopore force spectroscopy system is able to distinguish the cooperative binding conformation from the noncooperative one. The \u223c50% cooperative binding conformation of wild-type PABPs indicates that the C-C domain interaction doubles the cooperative binding probability. Moreover, the longer dissociation time of a cooperatively bound poly(A)\/PABP complex as compared with a noncooperatively bound one indicates that the cooperative mode is the most stable conformation for PABPs binding onto the poly(A). However, \u223c50% of the poly(A)\/PABP complexes exhibit a noncooperative binding conformation, which is in line with previous studies showing that the PABP C-terminal domain also interacts with additional protein cofactors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["Amit Meller"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bpj.2012.02.025","first_seen_on":"2012-04-07T16:25:14+00:00","issns":["0006-3495"],"journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1343036103,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/biophysj\/retrieve\/pii\/S0006349512002287"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/download.cell.com\/biophysj\/pdf\/PIIS0006349512002287.pdf","pmid":"22455926","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Nanopore Detachment Kinetics of Poly(A) Binding Proteins from RNA Molecules Reveals the Critical Role of C-Terminus Interactions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanopore-detachment-kinetics-polya-binding-proteins-rna-molecules-reveals-critical-role-cterminus-in"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":2016323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73753,"mean":4.1649953086017,"rank":31674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":28217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73753,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1684,"mean":2.6778573975045,"rank":732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1684,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.91666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
