PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"In order to promote siRNA transfer in tumour cells, we used an original cationic lipid, synthesized in our laboratory, dimethyl-hydroxyethyl-aminopropane-carbamoyl-cholesterol (DMHAPC-Chol). Liposomes were prepared from this lipid and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) in equimolar proportion. Its transfecting capacity was evaluated using ELISA, cell cytometry, and RT-PCR in estimating the silencing effect of VEGF siRNA. This liposome efficiently delivered VEGF siRNA in two human cancer cell lines abundantly secreting VEGF, A431 and MDA-MB-231. Results showed that 50 nM of VEGF siRNA carried by DMHAPC-Chol\/DOPE liposomes already silenced more than 90% of VEGF in these cells. A comparative study with two commercial carriers indicated that the inhibition induced by VEGF siRNA transported by cationic DMHAPC-Chol\/DOPE liposomes was comparable to that induced by INTERFERin and better than lipofectamine 2000. Moreover, a transfection by a GFP plasmid followed by a GFP siRNA showed that DMHAPC-Chol\/DOPE liposomes compared to lipofectamine were less efficient for plasmid but better for siRNA transport. Following one of our previous works concerning cell delivery of plasmid ( Percot et al., 2004 ), the main interest of results presented here resides in the double potential of DMHAPC-Chol\/DOPE liposomes to deliver little-sized siRNA as well as large nucleic acids in cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fc1","doi":"10.3109\/1061186x.2012.656645","first_seen_on":"2012-04-06T15:54:35+00:00","issns":["1029-2330"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Drug Targeting","last_mentioned_on":1333727497,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22475204?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22475204","pubdate":"2012-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Inhibition of VEGF expression in A431 and MDA-MB-231 tumour cells by cationic lipid-mediated siRNA delivery.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-vegf-expression-a431-mdamb231-tumour-cells-cationic-lipidmediated-sirna-delivery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4203475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79077,"mean":4.788210632809,"rank":64946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79077,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180,"mean":1.7051620111732,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
