IGF-1 has major effects on development, cell growth and differentiation, and tissue repair. Recent evidence indicates that IGF-1 reduces atherosclerosis burden and improves features of atherosclerotic plaque stability in animal models. Potential mechanisms for this atheroprotective effect include IGF-1-induced reduction in oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, proinflammatory signaling, and endothelial dysfunction. Aging is associated with increased vascular oxidative stress and vascular disease, suggesting that IGF-1 may exert salutary effects on vascular aging processes. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive update on IGF-1's ability to modulate vascular oxidative stress and to limit atherogenesis and the vascular complications of aging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fab","doi":"10.1093\/gerona\/gls102","first_seen_on":"2012-04-07T02:31:51+00:00","funders":["nigms","nhlbi"],"issns":["1758-535X"],"journal":"Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1386613488,"links":["http:\/\/biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/04\/05\/gerona.gls102.short?rss=1","http:\/\/biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/04\/09\/gerona.gls102.full","http:\/\/biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/67A\/6\/626.abstract?sid=d85e5369-67ff-44a9-b3b8-fb14601fe12f"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/04\/05\/gerona.gls102.full.pdf","pmid":"22491965","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Aging, Atherosclerosis, and IGF-1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aging-atherosclerosis-igf1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":850731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3628484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76594,"mean":4.5290164114214,"rank":13277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":62946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76594,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":994,"mean":5.394358509567,"rank":266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":994,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":5.6834666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
