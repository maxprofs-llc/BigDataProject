Here evidence is presented that dissociated cell membrane fragments from a DC line can be used as an effective substitute for viable DC. Ultracentrifuged material derived from sonicates of IFN-gamma-matured DC is enriched in small membrane vesicles that closely resemble exosomes. When complexed with MHC class I-restricted specific peptide, vesicles from DC sonicates generate strong responses by purified na\u00efve CD8(+) cells in vitro in the absence of normal antigen-presenting cells and can also efficiently prime T cells for tumor rejection in vivo. Both in terms of total yields from DC and relative immunogenicity, membrane vesicles from DC sonicates are much more effective than classic exosomes and may be a valuable tool for tumor immunotherapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006PNAS..10311671K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Kovar M","Boyman O","Shen X","Hwang I","Kohler R","Sprent J"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0603466103","endpage":"11676","first_seen_on":"2012-04-08T14:59:43+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"31","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1355137446,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16855047"],"pmcid":"PMC1544228","pmid":"16855047","pubdate":"2006-07-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"11671","subjects":["science"],"title":"Direct stimulation of T cells by membrane vesicles from antigen-presenting cells.","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-stimulation-t-cells-membrane-vesicles-antigenpresenting-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6288196,"mean":5.8077694174525,"rank":2963643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1890192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6288196,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81742,"mean":4.9172658763656,"rank":36335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":33779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81742,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39601,"mean":20.625571666667,"rank":29287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":4109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39601,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":794,"mean":18.172865069357,"rank":551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":794,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
