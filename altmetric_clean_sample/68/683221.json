We recently conducted several studies on the possible impact of global warming on the protein families of influenza A virus. More studies are needed in order to have a full picture of the impact of global warming on living organisms, especially its effect on viruses. In this study, we correlate trends in global warming with evolution of the nucleoprotein from influenza A virus and then analyse the trends with respect to northern\/southern hemispheres, virus subtypes and sampling species. The results suggest that global warming may have an impact on the evolution of the nucleoprotein from influenza A virus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003688","authors":["Yan, S.","Wu, G."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1865-1682.2010.01164.x","endpage":"413","first_seen_on":"2012-04-05T08:37:31+00:00","issns":["1865-1682","1865-1674"],"issue":"6","journal":"Transboundary & Emerging Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1366873862,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/j.1865-1682.2010.01164.x","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1865-1682.2010.01164.x\/abstract;jsessionid=8B027B8962DE6E145009B64276914253.d02t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1865-1682.2010.01164.x\/abstract;jsessionid=B5EA9FD23CFC3A3028312FF35C32288C.d03t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1865-1682.2010.01164.x\/abstract;jsessionid=F9A75037C9C6EB05703B96353E9E6F47.d03t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1865-1682.2010.01164.x\/pdf","pmid":"20825589","pubdate":"2010-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"404","title":"Trends in Global Warming and Evolution of Nucleoproteins from Influenza A Viruses since 1918","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trends-global-warming-evolution-nucleoproteins-influenza-viruses-since-1918"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4205129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78864,"mean":4.7631719310703,"rank":64808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78864,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":2.1294340836013,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":3,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
