Because of its geometrical complexity, assessment of RV dimensions with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a difficult task. The aim of this prospective single-site study was to investigate the feasibility of intraoperative assessment of RV parameters based on reconstructive three-dimensional (3D) TEE and to compare the measurements to thermodilution-derived values acquired with a modified pulmonary artery catheter.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd0e","authors":["Rosendal C","Almamat Uulu K","De Simone R","Wolf I","Deckert A","Martin EO","B\u00f6ttiger BW","Rauch H"],"first_seen_on":"2012-04-07T08:29:14+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of transplantation quarterly of the Polish Transplantation Society","last_mentioned_on":1333787118,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22466905?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22466905","pubdate":"2012-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Right ventricular function during orthotopic liver transplantation: Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography and thermodilution.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/right-ventricular-function-during-orthotopic-liver-transplantation-threedimensional-transesophageal-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":2899479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73757,"mean":4.1559897771028,"rank":52891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73757,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":1.2190869565217,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/cardiacimaging\/status\/188542954795843585","citation_ids":[686576],"posted_on":"2012-04-07T08:25:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiac","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1GEa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2406742261\/x3ds44aipz7rb9caz5p1_normal.jpeg","description":"Cardiovascular imaging and heart health.","id_on_source":"cardiacimaging","tweeter_id":"64524440","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":7857},"tweet_id":"188542954795843585"}]}}
