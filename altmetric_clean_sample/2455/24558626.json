Murakami, Matsui and Ohki"],"citation":{"abstract":"Recent studies suggest that higher visual areas (HVAs) in the mouse visual cortex are anatomically segregated into two visual streams, likely analogous to the ventral and dorsal streams in primates. However, HVAs in mice have yet to be functionally characterized. Moreover, it is unknown when the functional segregation of HVAs occurs during development. Here, we investigated spatiotemporal selectivity of HVAs and their development using wide-field calcium imaging. We found that lateral HVAs in the anatomical ventral stream shared similar spatiotemporal selectivity, whereas the spatiotemporal selectivity of anterior and medial HVAs in the anatomical dorsal stream was not uniform, and these areas were functionally segregated into multiple groups. This functional segregation of HVAs developed and reached an adult-like pattern approximately ten days after eye opening. These results suggest not only the functional segregation of ventral and dorsal streams but also the presence of multiple sub-streams in dorsal stream, and indicate that the functional segregation of visual streams occurs gradually after eye opening.Significance StatementInvestigation of the spatiotemporal selectivity of nine higher visual areas (HVAs) in adult and developing mice revealed that lateral HVAs belonging to the putative ventral stream shared similar spatiotemporal selectivity, whereas the spatiotemporal selectivity of anterior and medial HVAs belonging to the putative dorsal stream was not uniform, and these areas were functionally segregated into multiple groups. These results suggest the presence of multiple sub-streams within the putative dorsal stream for visuospatial processing. Furthermore, we found that initially immature functional segregation among HVAs developed to adult-like pattern in approximately ten days after eye opening. These results provide a foundation for using mouse HVAs as a model to understand parallel processing and its developmental mechanism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Tomonari Murakami","Teppei Matsui","Kenichi Ohki"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.0731-17.2017","first_seen_on":"2017-08-31T07:57:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0270-6474","1529-2401"],"issue":"39","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1506574764,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/early\/2017\/08\/28\/JNEUROSCI.0731-17.2017","http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/37\/39\/9424?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/jneuro\/early\/2017\/08\/28\/JNEUROSCI.0731-17.2017.full.pdf","pmid":"28847805","pubdate":"2017-08-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"0731-17","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Functional Segregation and Development of Mouse Higher Visual Areas","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functional-segregation-development-mouse-higher-visual-areas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.05,"score_history":{"1y":4.05,"6m":4.05,"3m":4.05,"1m":1.85,"1w":1.35,"6d":1.35,"5d":1.1,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":1863564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6591256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179400,"mean":12.436182542823,"rank":48885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":130176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179400,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12606,"mean":10.201532566442,"rank":4379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":8225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12606,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230,"mean":14.537930131004,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
