Accurate diagnosis of AD and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment, is crucial for clinical trial design. There is also growing interests in identifying brain imaging biomarkers that help evaluate AD risk presymptomatically. Here, we applied a recently developed multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) method to extract features from hippocampal surfaces, derived from anatomical brain MRI. For such surface-based features, the feature dimension is usually much larger than the number of subjects. We used dictionary learning and sparse coding to effectively reduce the feature dimensions. With the new features, an Adaboost classifier was employed for binary group classification. In tests on publicly available data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the new framework outperformed several standard imaging measures in classifying different stages of AD. The new approach combines the efficiency of sparse coding with the sensitivity of surface mTBM, and boosts classification performance.","authors":["Zhang, Jie","Stonnington, Cynthia","Li, Qingyang","Shi, Jie","Bauer, Robert J","Gutman, Boris A","Chen, Kewei","Reiman, Eric M","Thompson, Paul M","Ye, Jieping","Wang, Yalin"],"doi":"10.1109\/isbi.2016.7493350","first_seen_on":"2016-08-12T23:16:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-7928"],"journal":"Proceedings \/ IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: from nano to macro.
