This behavior has strong implications on the tribological properties of these systems and may be the key to understand the enhanced inter-wall friction recently measured for boron-nitride nanotubes with respect to their carbon counterparts. Notably, the fast rotation of helical facets in these systems upon coaxial sliding may serve as a nanoscale Archimedean screw for directional transport of physisorbed molecules.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Roberto Guerra","Itai Leven","Andrea Vanossi","Oded Hod","Erio Tosatti"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.nanolett.7b01718","first_seen_on":"2017-09-04T13:40:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-6984","1530-6992"],"journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1504528165,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1021\/acs.nanolett.7b01718"],"pmid":"28795813","pubdate":"2017-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Smallest Archimedean Screw: Facet Dynamics and Friction in Multiwalled Nanotubes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/smallest-archimedean-screw-facet-dynamics-friction-multiwalled-nanotubes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16,"score_history":{"1y":16,"6m":16,"3m":16,"1m":16,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360463,"mean":7.0503912403329,"rank":543020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7812681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360463,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116696,"mean":12.005513758087,"rank":12215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":104438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116696,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4335,"mean":12.465819104753,"rank":677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4335,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":11.445743589744,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
