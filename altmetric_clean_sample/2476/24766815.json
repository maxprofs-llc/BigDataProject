Medicolegal data for sexual assault has been collected at the hospital since 2012. However, no analysis had been done regardless of complaints having been raised. We analysed the dataset to determine the quality of clinical care offered to sexual assault victims.\nA retrospective cross-sectional study based on secondary data was conducted. Epi. Info 7 software was used to analyse data and generate frequencies, measures of central tendency and proportions.\nWe analysed 474 medical affidavits completed between January 2014 and July 2016. Thirty percent of the victims sought care within 72\u00a0h of the sexual assault. Baseline HIV testing was done in 23 (22%) and follow-up HIV test done in 2 (2%) of the victims. Post Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV was administered to 18 (51%), emergency contraception 9 (69%) and forensic evidence gathered in six (5%) of victims presenting within the prescribed 72\u00a0h of the sexual assault. Prophylactic antibiotics were given to 156 (33%). There were no documented counselling sessions for all victims whilst follow up care was given to 47 (10%) victims.\nSuboptimal clinical care was given to victims of sexual assault during the period 2014-2016. These findings suggest possible delayed presentation by victims of sexual assault as well as suboptimal administration of prophylaxis by health care workers. We recommend adherence to guidelines in managing sexual assault. Further research to determine factors for delayed presentation among sexual assault victims and quality of care provided to them is recommended.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Stanley Tapesana","Daniel Chirundu","Gerald Shambira","Notion Tafara Gombe","Tsitsi Patience Juru","Tshimanga Mufuta"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12879-017-2702-4","first_seen_on":"2017-09-04T17:11:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1506432016,"links":["https:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12879-017-2702-4","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5580318\/?report=classic"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12879-017-2702-4?site=bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28859613","pubdate":"2017-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"602","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Clinical care given to victims of sexual assault at Kadoma General Hospital, Zimbabwe: a secondary data analysis, 2016","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-care-given-victims-sexual-assault-kadoma-general-hospital-zimbabwe-secondary-data-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0.75,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":4523074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2357818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169835,"mean":12.145664637234,"rank":92279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":60388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169835,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3772,"mean":3.9597512596128,"rank":2129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3772,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":3.4,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"VE":1,"US":3}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BIOCIENCIA2013\/statuses\/904753666984431617","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24766815],"posted_on":"2017-09-04T17:10:58+00:00","author":{"name":"BIOCIENCIA","url":"http:\/\/musical100fm.com.ve\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000300217090\/9b25d5f581a95fff46afd4d8d0d0aad0_normal.jpeg","description":"Programa radial de enfermedades, avances tecnol\u00f3gicos, eventos cient\u00edficos de inter\u00e9s, noticias, entrevistas","id_on_source":"BIOCIENCIA2013","tweeter_id":"1672141952","geo":{"lt":10.46354,"ln":-64.1775,"country":"VE"},"followers":901},"tweet_id":"904753666984431617"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hlth_Literacy\/statuses\/906689956571213824","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24766815],"posted_on":"2017-09-10T01:25:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Health Literacy","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731064960\/LiteracyII_normal.jpg","description":"Eclectic health info, Health Literacy  Also @HIV_Insight @Prison_Health, @Why_We_Do_That, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Hlth_Literacy","tweeter_id":"77314206","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":6046},"tweet_id":"906689956571213824"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sex_Worker_Hlth\/statuses\/906689956885786625","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24766815],"posted_on":"2017-09-10T01:25:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Sex_Worker_Hlth","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/781973423\/ruth-palmer-deep-purple-mist_normal.jpg","description":"Commercial Sex Worker Health Information.
