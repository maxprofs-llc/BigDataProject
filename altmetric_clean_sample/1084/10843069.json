However, fingerprint representations necessarily emphasize particular aspects of the molecular structure while ignoring others, rather than allowing the model to make data-driven decisions. We describe molecular graph convolutions, a machine learning architecture for learning from undirected graphs, specifically small molecules. Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular graph-atoms, bonds, distances, etc.-which allows the model to take greater advantage of information in the graph structure. Although graph convolutions do not outperform all fingerprint-based methods, they (along with other graph-based methods) represent a new paradigm in ligand-based virtual screening with exciting opportunities for future improvement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d2a","authors":["Steven Kearnes","Kevin McCloskey","Marc Berndl","Vijay Pande","Patrick Riley"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10822-016-9938-8","endpage":"608","first_seen_on":"2016-08-26T11:03:07+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1573-4951","0920-654X"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design","last_mentioned_on":1492736608,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10822-016-9938-8","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10822-016-9938-8","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10822-016-9938-8"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10822-016-9938-8.pdf","pmid":"27558503","pubdate":"2016-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Anatomy \/ Morphology \/ Histology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Applications in Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"startpage":"595","subjects":["molecularbiology","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Molecular graph convolutions: moving beyond fingerprints","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10822-016-9938-8","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-graph-convolutions-moving-beyond-fingerprints"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.014,"score_history":{"1y":13.014,"6m":4.3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.014},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085159,"mean":6.8783507387159,"rank":622932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7462219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085159,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250236,"mean":12.384122269067,"rank":30525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":219711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250236,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335,"mean":4.2682874251497,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.992,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":43,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
