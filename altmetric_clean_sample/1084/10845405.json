Recently, thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been discovered and implicated in a variety of biological processes. However, the role of most lncRNAs in heart failure remains largely unknown. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the expression and function of lncRNAs are differentially regulated in diseased hearts.\nIn this study, we performed RNA deep sequencing of protein-coding and non-coding RNAs from cardiac samples of patients with ICM (n=15) and controls (n=15). Genome-wide transcriptome analysis confirmed that many protein-coding genes previously known to be involved in heart failure were altered in ICM hearts. Among the 145 differentially expressed lncRNAs identified in ICM hearts, we found a set of 35 lncRNAs that display strong positive expression correlation. Expression correlation coefficient analyses of differentially expressed lncRNAs and protein-coding genes revealed a strong association between lncRNAs and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein-coding genes. We overexpressed or knocked down selected lncRNAs in cardiac fibroblasts and our results suggest that lncRNAs are important regulators of fibrosis and the expression of extracellular matrix synthesis genes. Moreover, we show that lncRNAs participate in the TGF- \u03b2 pathway to modulate the expression of ECM genes and myofibroblast differentiation.\nOur studies demonstrate that the expression of many lncRNAs is dynamically regulated in ICM. lncRNAs regulate the expression and function of ECM and cardiac fibrosis during the development of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Our results further indicate that lncRNAs may represent novel regulators of heart function and cardiac disorders, including ischemic cardiomyopathy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024b0","authors":["Huang, Zhan-Peng","Ding, Yan","Chen, Jinghai","Wu, Gengze","Kataoka, Masaharu","Hu, Yongwu","Yang, Jian-Hua","Liu, Jianming","Drakos, Stavros G","Selzman, Craig H","Kyselovic, Jan","Qu, Liang-Hu","Dos Remedios, Cristobal G","Pu, William T","Wang, Da-Zhi","Drakos, Stavros G.","Selzman, Craig H.","dos Remedios, Cristobal G.","Pu, William T."],"doi":"10.1093\/cvr\/cvw201","first_seen_on":"2016-08-26T12:58:27+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1755-3245","0008-6363"],"journal":"Cardiovascular Research","last_mentioned_on":1488056549,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27557636?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27557636","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/cardiovascres\/article-abstract\/112\/2\/543\/2415086\/Long-non-coding-RNAs-link-extracellular-matrix#.WLHw2p5Vg4g.twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/cardiovascres\/article-pdf\/112\/2\/543\/7865041\/cvw201.pdf","pmid":"27557636","pubdate":"2016-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"cvw201","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Long non-coding RNAs link extracellular matrix gene expression to ischemic cardiomyopathy","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/cardiovascres\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/cvr\/cvw201","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/long-noncoding-rnas-link-extracellular-matrix-gene-expression-ischemic-cardiomyopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":3793663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4395637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252642,"mean":12.380232400916,"rank":111740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":136426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252642,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1061,"mean":2.3495056603774,"rank":367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1061,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.95588235294118,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
