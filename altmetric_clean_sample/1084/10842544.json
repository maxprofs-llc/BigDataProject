We have previously characterized an embryonic phenotype of the single Caenorhabditis elegans CaM gene cmd-1, reported no visible RNAi phenotype for the four related cal-1 to cal-4 genes and started tissue-specific expression analyses of these proteins. In the present study, we analyzed evolutionary aspects of the previously reported CAL-1 to CAL-4 proteins, along with the four new CAL-5 to CAL-8 sequences retrieved from the worm database. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that all C. elegans CAL proteins arose from a CaM ancestor through repeated gene duplications, fusions and sequence divergence. The same holds, also, for the variable N-terminal extensions of the CAL-1 to CAL-4 proteins, which have evolved from the CaM-like core domain. We found 97 CAL homologs in different nematode clades and also detected two CAL-7-related sequences outside the nematodes. Moreover, the C. elegans-specific cal-6 gene, representing the most CaM-related sequence found in nematodes so far, harbours many deletions, insertions and sequence substitutions and is predicted, therefore, to be non-functional. These analyses provide an insight into a complex and dynamic origin of the multiple CAL genes in C. elegans and in nematodes and represent also a basis for further functional studies of these CaM-related sequences in nematodes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ea","authors":["Karabinos, Anton","Anton Karabinos"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00427-016-0558-z","first_seen_on":"2016-08-26T10:19:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-041X","0949-944X"],"journal":"Development Genes & Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1500217144,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27558386?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27558386?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27558386","pubdate":"2016-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Developmental Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"Molecular evolution of the multiple calmodulin-like cal genes in C. elegans and in nematodes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-evolution-multiple-calmodulinlike-cal-genes-c-elegans-nematodes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219190,"mean":6.9624096623095,"rank":2015665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6164572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219190,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251402,"mean":12.416528589782,"rank":80437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":169800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251402,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223,"mean":3.3417927927928,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.01875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2,"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Nematode_papers\/statuses\/769117011439853568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10842544],"posted_on":"2016-08-26T10:19:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Nematode_papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"Twitter bot searching the web for new journal articles on #nematodes","id_on_source":"Nematode_papers","tweeter_id":"2882533695","geo":{"lt":54.58333,"ln":-5.93333,"country":"GB"},"followers":117},"tweet_id":"769117011439853568"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fruitWormPapers\/statuses\/769143559320592384","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10842544],"posted_on":"2016-08-26T12:04:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Fruit Worms","url":"http:\/\/fruit-worm-papers.tumblr.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/529745729099530240\/fNhHNBM4_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous, auto-updated feed of #Celegans (and other Caenorhabditeae) of fruit or wherever they may be -- PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and @PeerJ PrePrints.","id_on_source":"fruitWormPapers","tweeter_id":"2861324512","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":289},"tweet_id":"769143559320592384"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mcmullan_papers\/statuses\/769147292334993408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10842544],"posted_on":"2016-08-26T12:19:39+00:00","author":{"name":"mcmullanlab_papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"mcmullan_papers","tweeter_id":"2791619983","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":13},"tweet_id":"769147292334993408"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/phy_papers\/statuses\/769207616660578304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10842544],"posted_on":"2016-08-26T16:19:21+00:00","author":{"name":"phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438115152294989824\/0M7ZG0xC_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for phylogenetics papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
