Despite a range of relevant theories, there is limited understanding of the process of adjustment. The study aimed to address this issue. That was achieved through collecting and analysing personal narratives using individual interviews and focus groups. This allowed for the development of a normative integrative model of adjustment to chronic conditions based on biopsychosocial principles. The integrative model of adjustment to chronic condition has the potential to lead to improved understanding of adjustment processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd2","authors":["L. D.
