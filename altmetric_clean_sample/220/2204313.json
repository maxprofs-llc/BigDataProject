Here we describe 4 cases to illustrate that in a subset of patients with pleural effusion, a posterior imaging approach can be used to obtain diagnostic images for native and prosthetic aortic valves. In these cases, nondiagnostic transthoracic echocardiographic images were obtained from conventional imaging windows, leading to inaccurate or incomplete assessment of the aortic valve. In all cases, images obtained from a posterior thoracic approach provided important additional diagnostic information.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f0e","authors":["Ming-Sum Lee","Tasneem Z.
