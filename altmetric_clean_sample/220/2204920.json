From a respondent-driven sampling survey in Shenzhen, China, we quantified the burden of HIV\/syphilis and studied patterns of risk and prevention behaviors in 107 MSMW, and compared these with those of 542 men who have sex with men only (MSM-only). HIV prevention behaviors and consistent condom use with male partners did not differ between the two groups. However, HIV risk behaviors were more common among MSMW than MSM-only. Moreover, among MSMW, the HIV prevalence was as high as 6\u00a0% and consistent condom use was extremely low with female partners in MSMW. We conclude that there is risk of HIV transmission from MSMW to the female population. Special efforts are needed to convince MSMW they should refrain from HIV risk behaviors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","authors":["Cai R","Zhao J","Cai W","Chen L","Richardus JH","de Vlas SJ"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10461-014-0735-x","first_seen_on":"2014-03-22T11:11:47+00:00","issns":["1090-7165"],"issue":"","journal":"AIDS & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1395485523,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24578012"],"pmid":"24578012","pubdate":"2014-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome","behavioralsciences"],"title":"HIV Risk and Prevention Behaviors in Men Who Have Sex With Men and Women: A Respondent-Driven Sampling Study in Shenzhen, China.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hiv-risk-prevention-behaviors-men-sex-men-women-respondentdriven-sampling-study-shenzhen-china-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228670,"mean":5.9649392979483,"rank":4606204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228670,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133596,"mean":8.2937033871029,"rank":89151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":24683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133596,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1376,"mean":4.0798603636364,"rank":1158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1376,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":4.2959322033898,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
