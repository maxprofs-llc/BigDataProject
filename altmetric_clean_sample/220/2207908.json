This qualitative study, undertaken alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT), explored this issue. The trial compared ribotyping versus more rapid genotyping (MLVA or multilocus variable repeat analysis) and found no significant difference in post 48 hour cases (C difficile transmissions).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2334-14-154","first_seen_on":"2014-03-24T12:06:47+00:00","funders":["dohuk"],"issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1395662776,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2334\/14\/154\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2334-14-154.pdf","pmid":"24656142","pubdate":"2014-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"154","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"How do hospital professionals involved in a randomised controlled trial perceive the value of genotyping vs. PCR-ribotyping for control of hospital acquired C. difficile infections?","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hospital-professionals-involved-randomised-controlled-trial-perceive-value-genotyping-vs-pcrribotypi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":4206432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122590,"mean":8.2783302906461,"rank":100157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122590,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2668,"mean":3.1894975628046,"rank":2432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2668,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":4.0061515151515,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
