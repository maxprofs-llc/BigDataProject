We demonstrate that SPOP, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase component, is a direct transcriptional target of HIFs in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Furthermore, hypoxia results in cytoplasmic accumulation of SPOP, which is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis. This tumorigenic activity occurs through the ubiquitination and degradation of multiple regulators of cellular proliferation and apoptosis, including the tumor suppressor PTEN, ERK phosphatases, the proapoptotic molecule Daxx, and the Hedgehog pathway transcription factor Gli2. Knockdown of SPOP specifically kills ccRCC cells, indicating that it may be a promising therapeutic target. Collectively, our results indicate that SPOP serves as a regulatory hub to promote ccRCC tumorigenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002496","authors":["Guoqiang Li","Weimin Ci","Subhradip Karmakar","Ke Chen","Ruby Dhar","Zhixiang Fan","Zhongqiang Guo","Jing Zhang","Yuwen Ke","Lu Wang","Min Zhuang","Shengdi Hu","Xuesong Li","Liqun Zhou","Xianghong Li","Matthew\u00a0F.
