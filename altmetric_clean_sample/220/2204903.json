We reviewed the medical records of 127 consecutive patients who underwent autologous BMT or PSCT for breast cancer at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center from 1 May 1991 through 31 March 1995 and through 1 year of follow-up. The mean duration of neutropenia after transplantation was 10 days. Initial infections included catheter-site cellulitis (in 20 patients [16%]), bacteremia (17 [13%]), Clostridium difficile colitis (13 [10%]), and urinary tract infection (in 10 [8%]); there was only 1 documented invasive fungal infection (1% of patients). The mortality from infection was 2%. Infections during the 1 year follow-up included upper respiratory infections (11 patients [10%]) and dermatomal zoster (9 [8%]); neither was significantly associated with death. This group of patients who underwent BMT or PSCT for breast cancer had a low rate of infectious morbidity and mortality. Viral and fungal infections were rare despite inconsistent prophylaxis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Todd D.
