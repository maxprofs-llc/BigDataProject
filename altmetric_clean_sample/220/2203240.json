Although dedicated community engagement is crucial for the success of the program, there is little\/no information on the levels of community's knowledge, attitude and practice about onchocerciasis as well as about the ongoing control program in Ethiopia. In this study, we have assessed the level of knowledge, attitude and practice of Quara district residents about onchocerciasis and the current control strategies in the area.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000883","authors":["Weldegebreal F","Medhin G","Weldegebriel Z","Legesse M"],"doi":"10.1186\/1756-3305-7-98","first_seen_on":"2014-03-21T14:37:28+00:00","issns":["1756-3305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasites & Vectors","last_mentioned_on":1431615605,"links":["http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/7\/1\/98","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24612494?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/pdf\/1756-3305-7-98.pdf","pmid":"24612494","pubdate":"2014-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"98","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Assessment of community's knowledge, attitude and practice about onchocerciasis and community directed treatment with Ivermectin in Quara District, north western Ethiopia.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-communitys-knowledge-attitude-practice-about-onchocerciasis-community-directed-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230817,"mean":5.9681223701699,"rank":2072651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4138518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230817,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133171,"mean":8.3105322369905,"rank":41774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":90789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133171,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1821,"mean":3.4954098901099,"rank":486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1821,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":4.0499677419355,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
