Enhancers are DNA regulatory elements that are key regulators of tissue-specific gene expression. Recent studies suggest that enhancer malfunction through point mutations in either regulatory elements or factors modulating enhancer-promoter communication could be the cause of tissue-specific cancer development. In this Perspective, we will discuss recent findings in the identification of cancer-related enhancer mutations and the role of Drosophila Trr and its human homologs, the MLL3 and MLL4\/COMPASS-like complexes, as enhancer histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) monomethyltransferases functioning in enhancer-promoter communication. Recent genome-wide studies in the cataloging of somatic mutations in cancer have identified mutations in intergenic sequences encoding regulatory elements-and in MLL3 and MLL4 in both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. We propose that cancer-associated mutations in MLL3 and MLL4 exert their properties through the malfunction of Trr\/MLL3\/MLL4-dependent enhancers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","authors":["Hans-Martin Herz","Deqing Hu","Ali Shilatifard","Herz HM","Hu D","Shilatifard A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molcel.2014.02.033","endpage":"866","first_seen_on":"2014-03-21T14:43:43+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1097-2765","10972765"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1467367052,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/molecular-cell\/abstract\/S1097-2765(14)00205-6","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/molecular-cell\/abstract\/S1097-2765%2814%2900205-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24656127?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fmolecular-cell%2Fabstract%2FS1097-2765%252814%252900205-6&code=cell-site","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24656127"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/download.cell.com\/molecular-cell\/pdf\/S1097276514002056.pdf","pmid":"24656127","pubdate":"2014-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"859","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Enhancer Malfunction in Cancer","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhancer-malfunction-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7974292,"mean":6.7330879653071,"rank":1232618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6738140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7974292,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175266,"mean":7.4926852708758,"rank":30060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":145093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175266,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3736,"mean":8.382944042838,"rank":825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":2907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3736,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":9.4666216216216,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":10},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":10,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":14,"Researcher":53,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
