This longitudinal study investigated the association between addictive Internet use during adolescence and heavy drinking and cigarette smoking in early adulthood.\nWe focused on middle school students from the Korea Youth Panel Study who were 16 in 2003:1,804 who did not drink alcohol and 2,277 who did not smoke. Multivariate logistic analysis investigated the relationships between Internet use at the age of 16, with regard to location, time spent and reason for use, and drinking and smoking at the age of 20.\nUsing the Internet for chatting, games, and adult websites at the age of 16 had a significant association with heavy drinking at the age of 20. The Internet caf\u00e9 as the location for Internet use at the age of 16 was associated with smoking behaviour at the age of 20.\nThis study confirmed significant associations between addictive use of the Internet at the age of 16 and heavy drinking and cigarette smoking at the age of 20. The findings demonstrated the negative effects of addictive Internet use, one of the biggest problems with adolescents. This article is protected by copyright.
