Embolisms can go to either arterial or venous systems with common sites of injury including the left ventricle, pulmonary vein, thoracic and abdominal aorta and peripheral arteries. Herein we present a case of a 19 year old patient with multiple gunshot wounds to the torso with a bullet embolism to the left popliteal artery necessitating embolectomy. This subsequently led to diagnosis and repair of an abdominal aortic psuedoaneurysm not clearly evident on initial imaging.","altmetric_jid":"567962162a83ee58358b459e","authors":["Junjian Huang","Vivek Pandey","Rohan Shah","Vivek Yedavalli","Anand Joshi","Roger Stimpson","Mark Keldahl","Loren Zuiderveld"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.radcr.2016.04.011","endpage":"286","first_seen_on":"2016-12-15T16:23:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1930-0433","19300433"],"issue":"4","journal":"Radiology Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1481818974,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5128195\/"],"pmid":"27920844","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","startpage":"282","title":"Popliteal artery embolism of bullet after abdominal gunshot wound","type":"article","volume":"11"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7890722,"mean":6.6811441707233,"rank":5984399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1058197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7890722,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251760,"mean":12.372410384534,"rank":176661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":46448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251760,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":2.1762222222222,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":4.55,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GacetaCienForen\/statuses\/809433562302844928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14770649],"posted_on":"2016-12-15T16:22:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Gac Ciencia Forense","url":"http:\/\/www.uv.es\/gicf\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566123006179545089\/yXGddJpq_normal.jpeg","description":"Gaceta Internacional de Ciencias Forenses \/ International Gazette of Forensic Sciences.
