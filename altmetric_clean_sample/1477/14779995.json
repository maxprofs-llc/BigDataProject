We observed that sera from DM\/CADM patients immunoprecipitated a common 110\u00a0kDa polypeptide. We investigated this autoantigen and its clinical significance.\nAutoantibodies were screened in 333 patients with various connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and 20 healthy controls (HCs) by immunoprecipitation with [(35)S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells. Immunoabsorbent column chromatography was used to purify the reactive autoantigen which was subsequently analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting.\nAnti-110\u00a0kDa antibody was detected in sera from 27 DM\/CADM patients, but not in sera from other CTD patients or HCs. All patients with anti-110\u00a0kDa antibody had anti-MDA5 antibody. The maximum KL-6 levels in anti-110\u00a0kDa antibody-positive patients were higher than in anti-110\u00a0kDa antibody-negative patients, and all anti-MDA5-antibody-positive patients who showed the recurrence of DM\/CADM were anti-110\u00a0kDa antibody-positive. The corresponding autoantigen was identified as splicing factor proline\/glutamine-rich protein (SFPQ). In some cases, anti-SFPQ antibody was detected at diagnosis (early-detected group), but in other cases, it appeared during the disease course (delayed-detected group). The diagnosis timing of DM\/CADM showed seasonal patterns according to the timing of anti-SFPQ antibody appearance. Specifically, 77% (10\/13) of patients were diagnosed between August and October in the early-detected group, while 57% (8\/14) of patients were diagnosed between January and March in the delayed-detected group.\nSome anti-MDA5 antibody-positive patients had an antibody to SFPQ, which is known to play a role in innate immune responses. Anti-SFPQ antibody may be involved in the chronic disease course of DM\/CADM. The diagnosis timing of DM\/CADM in anti-MDA5 antibody-positive patients showed seasonal patterns according to the timing of anti-SFPQ antibody appearance. These findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of DM\/CADM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb5","authors":["Hosono, Yuji","Nakashima, Ran","Serada, Satoshi","Murakami, Kosaku","Imura, Yoshitaka","Yoshifuji, Hajime","Ohmura, Koichiro","Naka, Tetsuji","Mimori, Tsuneyo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaut.2016.11.006","first_seen_on":"2016-12-16T01:44:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-9157","08968411"],"journal":"Journal of Autoimmunity","last_mentioned_on":1481852037,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0896841116302244"],"pmid":"27919567","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Splicing factor proline\/glutamine-rich is a novel autoantigen of dermatomyositis and associated with anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/splicing-factor-prolineglutaminerich-novel-autoantigen-dermatomyositis-associated-antimelanoma-diffe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7896890,"mean":6.6848881279648,"rank":6837662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7896890,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251977,"mean":12.391141569038,"rank":205577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251977,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":492,"mean":5.7331934826884,"rank":431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":492,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":8.704125,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
