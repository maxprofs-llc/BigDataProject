Previous reports have shown that D2O is toxic to many animals and rats avoid drinking it when offered H2O simultaneously. In the current study, summated responses were recorded from the chorda tympani nerves of rats after NaCl, KCl, sucrose and quinine were applied to the tongue in solutions of either D2O or H2O. Both solvents were used as the adapting or rinse solution in separate series. On tongues adapted to H2O, D2O elicited mean responses which were equivalent to 29% of the response to 0.1 M NaCl. The threshold concentration of D2O in H2O was between 25% and 50%. Solutes in D2O yielded responses which were greater than corresponding solutions of H2O when adapting rinse was H2O. Adaptation to D2O diminished the responses to D2O solutions of NaCl, KCl and sucrose but not quinine. This observation suggests that some portion of the augmented response to stimuli in D2O is due to the solvent itself. The taste of water has been examined by both electrophysiological methods and by behavior, but none of the mechanisms espoused for its effect seem adequate to explain the response to D2O. Water structure at the interface between molecular components of the cell membrane and the bulk phase of the surrounding medium is considered as a locus for disparity in the taste responses to D2O and H2O in the rat.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003325","authors":["Miller, I J","Mooser, G"],"first_seen_on":"2016-12-15T17:35:16+00:00","issns":["0031-9384"],"issue":"1","journal":"Physiology & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1481823301,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/515218"],"pmid":"515218","pubdate":"1979-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","physiology","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Taste responses to deuterium oxide.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/taste-responses-deuterium-oxide-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7890722,"mean":6.6811441707233,"rank":4136593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2199974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7890722,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251761,"mean":12.372386264696,"rank":139453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251761,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2393,"mean":8.7154046822742,"rank":1583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2393,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":6.598303030303,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Physics and Astronomy":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/prof_djadams\/statuses\/809451711488200704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14771885],"posted_on":"2016-12-15T17:35:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Adams","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/850162942398083073\/p39J2ELX_normal.jpg","description":"All views are my own!","id_on_source":"prof_djadams","tweeter_id":"3266276702","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":463},"tweet_id":"809451711488200704"}]}}
