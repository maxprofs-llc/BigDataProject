The deformation and the oscillatory excursion away from the surface are induced by picosecond acoustic pulses and probed at the surface plasmon resonance with femtosecond laser pulses. The overall dynamics are due to an efficient transfer of translational momentum from the Ni surface to the Au:NPs, therefore avoiding usual thermal effects and energy redistribution among the electronic states. Two modes are clearly revealed by the oscillatory shift of the Au:NPs surface plasmon resonance-the quadrupole deformation mode due to the transient ellipsoid shape and the excursion mode when the Au:NPs bounce away from the surface. We find that, contrary to the quadrupole mode, the excursion mode is sensitive to the distance between Au:NPs and Ni. Importantly, the excursion dynamics display a nonsinusoidal motion that cannot be explained by a standard harmonic potential model. A detailed modeling of the dynamics using a Hamaker-type Lennard-Jones potential between two media is performed, showing that each Au:NPs coherently evolves in a nearly one-dimensional anharmonic potential with a total excursion of \u223c1 \u00c5. This excursion induces a shift of the surface plasmon resonance detectable because of the strong near-field interaction. This general method of observing the spatiotemporal dynamics with angstrom and picosecond resolutions can be directly transposed to many nanostructures or biosystems to reveal the interaction and contact mechanism with their surrounding medium while remaining in their fundamental electronic states.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Ji-Wan Kim"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.6b05196","first_seen_on":"2016-12-15T16:17:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-0851","1936-086X"],"issue":"12","journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1481819952,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsnano.6b05196"],"pmid":"28024387","pubdate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Exploring the Angstrom Excursion of Au Nanoparticles Excited away from a Metal Surface by an Impulsive Acoustic Perturbation","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-angstrom-excursion-au-nanoparticles-excited-away-metal-surface-impulsive-acoustic-perturba"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":3.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7890722,"mean":6.6811441707233,"rank":1902236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":5972205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7890722,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251760,"mean":12.372399262787,"rank":83586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":167235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251760,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4825,"mean":11.718338308458,"rank":2094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4825,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":22.902643678161,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
