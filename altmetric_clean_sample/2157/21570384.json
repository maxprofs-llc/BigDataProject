The experimentally observed asymmetries are compared with the theoretical calculation of Pasquini and Vanderhaeghen [Phys. Rev. C 70, 045206 (2004).PRVCAN0556-281310.1103\/PhysRevC.70.045206]. The agreement of the measurements with the theoretical calculations shows a dominance of the inelastic intermediate excited states of the nucleon, \u03c0N and the \u0394 resonance. The measurements explore a new, important parameter region of the exchanged virtual photon virtualities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["R\u00edos, D Balaguer","Aulenbacher, K","Baunack, S","Diefenbach, J","Gl\u00e4ser, B","von Harrach, D","Imai, Y","Kabu\u00df, E-M","Kothe, R","Lee, J H","Merkel, H","Mora Esp\u00ed, M C","M\u00fcller, U","Schilling, E","Weinrich, C","Capozza, L","Maas, F E","Arvieux, J","El-Yakoubi, M A","Frascaria, R","Kunne, R","Morlet, M","Ong, S","van de Wiele, J","Kowalski, S","Prok, Y"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.119.012501","first_seen_on":"2017-07-06T21:30:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1079-7114"],"issue":"1","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1499374515,"links":["https:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.119.012501"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aps.org\/pdf\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.119.012501","pmid":"28731753","pubdate":"2017-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"New Measurements of the Beam Normal Spin Asymmetries at Large Backward Angles with Hydrogen and Deuterium Targets","type":"article","volume":"119"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170401,"mean":6.9145194585267,"rank":7070711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170401,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177531,"mean":11.58092019377,"rank":143976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177531,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16362,"mean":11.04482207689,"rank":13505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16362,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":371,"mean":19.158751351351,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":371,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/animesh1977\/statuses\/883066838669832198","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21570384],"posted_on":"2017-07-06T20:55:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Ani","url":"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/sharmaanimesh\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/734400513341526017\/jJnZP2H0_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"animesh1977","tweeter_id":"15936294","geo":{"lt":60.39299,"ln":5.32415,"country":"NO"},"followers":1643},"tweet_id":"883066838669832198"}]}}
