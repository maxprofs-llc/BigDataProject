A robust safety assessment for disposable diapers include two important exposure parameters, i) frequency of diaper use & ii) constituent transfer from diaper to skin from direct and indirect skin contact materials. This article uses published information and original studies to quantify the exposure parameters for diapers. Using growth tables for the first three years of diapered life, an average body weight of 10-11\u00a0kg can be calculated, with a 10th percentile for females (8.5-8.8\u00a0kg). Data from surveys and diary studies were conducted to determine the frequency of use of diapers. The overall mean in the US is 4.7 diapers per day with a 75th, 90th, and 95th percentile of 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 respectively. Using diaper topsheet-lotion transfer as a model, direct transfer to skin from the topsheet was 3.0-4.3% of the starting amount of lotion. Indirect transfer of diaper core materials as a measure of re-wetting of the skin via urine resurfacing back to the topsheet under pressure was estimated at a range of 0.32-0.66% averaging 0.46%. As described, a thorough data-based understanding of exposure is critical for a robust exposure based safety assessment of disposable diapers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003443","authors":["Swatee Dey","Mike Purdon","Taryn Kirsch","HansMartin Helbich","Kenny Kerr","Lijuan Li","Shaoying Zhou"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yrtph.2016.08.017","first_seen_on":"2017-07-06T21:31:52+00:00","issns":["02732300"],"journal":"Regulatory Toxicology & Pharmacology: RTP","last_mentioned_on":1502075855,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27580878"],"pmid":"27580878","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Exposure Factor considerations for safety evaluation of modern disposable diapers","type":"article","volume":"81","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exposure-factor-considerations-safety-evaluation-modern-disposable-diapers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":4442567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2320388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226638,"mean":12.580773880699,"rank":125998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":78997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226638,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1137,"mean":5.869985915493,"rank":893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1137,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":7.87625,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ToxAndBeyond\/statuses\/883068286321033216","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21570454],"posted_on":"2017-07-06T21:01:00+00:00","author":{"name":"ToxAndBeyond","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3001346476\/e2175a5b80ed27d6b5a3956bf5638ae2_normal.jpeg","description":"Information about science, the environment, consumer products, risk assessment, risk management, and beyond, served alongside the wonders of humor.","id_on_source":"ToxAndBeyond","tweeter_id":"446732734","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":216},"tweet_id":"883068286321033216"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ToxAndBeyond\/statuses\/894302310410498049","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21570454],"posted_on":"2017-08-06T21:01:00+00:00","author":{"name":"ToxAndBeyond","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3001346476\/e2175a5b80ed27d6b5a3956bf5638ae2_normal.jpeg","description":"Information about science, the environment, consumer products, risk assessment, risk management, and beyond, served alongside the wonders of humor.","id_on_source":"ToxAndBeyond","tweeter_id":"446732734","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":216},"tweet_id":"894302310410498049"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/acsdchas\/statuses\/894397080529248256","license":"gnip","rt":["ToxAndBeyond"],"citation_ids":[21570454],"posted_on":"2017-08-07T03:17:35+00:00","author":{"name":"ACS DCHAS","url":"http:\/\/www.dchas.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/625091701\/trchaslogo08_normal.gif","description":"Div of Chemical Health and Safety of the American Chemical Society reporting chemical events to raise awareness. #ChemicalSafety","id_on_source":"acsdchas","tweeter_id":"103966799","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":442},"tweet_id":"894397080529248256"}]}}
