Also, to assess the efficacy of monitoring somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) when motor-evoked potentials (MEP) are not measurable.\nThe Neuro-Oncology Clinic, National Cancer Center, Korea.\nPatients (n=101) with IDEM or epidural metastatic spinal tumors at the cord level underwent surgeries monitored with SSEP and\/or MEP. The monitoring rate was defined as negative when MEP or SSEP could not be measured after reversal of the neuromuscular block under general anesthesia. Positive IOM changes included more than a 50% change in the MEP or SSEP amplitude and more than a 10% delay in SSEP latency.\nMEP was measurable in 73% of patients. The MEP monitoring rate in patients with motor power grades of 3 or less was 39%, which was lower than that of SSEP (83%). The sensitivity, specificity and predictability of MEP for motor changes were 93, 90 and 91%, respectively. Conversely, the sensitivity, specificity and predictability of SSEP were 62, 97 and 89%, respectively. In patients in whom MEP was not measurable (n=24), SSEP was monitored with a predictability of 83%.\nIn cases of extramedullary spinal tumors, MEP shows a higher sensitivity than SSEP does. However, the monitoring rate of MEP in non-ambulatory patients was lower than that of SSEP. In those cases, SSEP can be useful to monitor for postoperative neurological deficits.Spinal Cord advance online publication, 9 May 2017; doi:10.1038\/sc.2017.43.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a6","authors":["H Kang","H S Gwak","S H Shin","M K Woo","I H Jeong","H Yoo","J W Kwon","S H Lee","Kang, H","Gwak, H S","Shin, S H","Woo, M K","Jeong, I H","Yoo, H","Kwon, J W","Lee, S H"],"doi":"10.1038\/sc.2017.43","first_seen_on":"2017-05-09T09:28:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1362-4393","1476-5624"],"journal":"Spinal Cord","last_mentioned_on":1494429847,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/sc\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/sc201743a.html?WT.feed_name=subjects_cancer&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/sc\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/sc201743a.html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28485386?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28485386?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28485386","pubdate":"2017-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"CNS cancer","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Outcomes research","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Monitoring rate and predictability of intraoperative monitoring in patients with intradural extramedullary and epidural metastatic spinal tumors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monitoring-rate-predictability-intraoperative-monitoring-patients-intradural-extramedullary-epidural"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":2.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183187,"mean":6.9217013823156,"rank":3316168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4808851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183187,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237114,"mean":12.41491205459,"rank":87498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":147855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237114,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1023,"mean":4.72,"rank":645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1023,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.8,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
