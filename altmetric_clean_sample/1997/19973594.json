Quantitative and qualitative methods were combined in an exploratory two cohort treatment\/control design with one cohort serving as the control group (single assessment) and a subsequent cohort as the treatment group (assessed before and immediately after treatment as well as 6 and 12 months after treatment ended), involving a total of 438 11-13 year old girls, According to analyses, depression symptoms were significantly lower directly after treatment and at 6 months but no longer at 12 months. Resilience scores, on the other hand, were significantly higher in the treatment cohort compared to the year-ahead control cohort at post-treatment and both follow-up assessments. Qualitative results demonstrated beneficial teacher experience overall. The current study provides first evidence for the efficacy of SPARK Resilience Programme. Furthermore, the applied two cohort treatment\/control mixed methods design proved helpful for the preliminary testing of a school-based universal intervention programme efficacy in an authentic setting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Michael Pluess","Ilona Boniwell","Kate Hefferon","Aneta Tunariu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0177191","first_seen_on":"2017-05-09T09:44:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1496160141,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0177191","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0177191","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0177191&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0177191&type=printable","pmid":"28481905","pubdate":"2017-05-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Preliminary evaluation of a school-based resilience-promoting intervention in a high-risk population: Application of an exploratory two-cohort treatment\/control design","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preliminary-evaluation-schoolbased-resiliencepromoting-intervention-highrisk-population-application"},"altmetric_score":{"score":30.6,"score_history":{"1y":30.6,"6m":30.6,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":30.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":291695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7998350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244541,"mean":12.350599746463,"rank":16643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":227886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244541,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114717,"mean":10.596301945675,"rank":6875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":107835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114717,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4205,"mean":10.254566127498,"rank":259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":3946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4205,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":12,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
