The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of eating disorders and its association with anxiety and depression symptomatology in high-risk pregnancies.\nthis is a cross-sectional and prospective study conducted at the tertiary university hospital in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. 913 pregnant women waiting for the Obstetrics' outpatient appointment were invited to participate in the study on their 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Structured interviews were carried out and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were applied.\nprevalence of eating disorder (ED) during pregnancy was 7.6% (n=69) (95% CI: 5.84% -9.28%), 0.1% (n=1) for anorexia nervosa; 0.7% (n=6) for bulimia nervosa; 1.1% (n=10) for binge eating disorder, and 5.7% (n=52) for pica. A statistically significant difference was found between the anxiety (p<0.01) and depressive symptoms (p<0.01).\nthe prevalence of ED (7.6%) and its association with anxiety and depression symptoms during pregnancy highlights the need for specialist care for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Given the importance of proper nutrition during pregnancy, both with regard to maternal health and fetal development, it is necessary to have specific predetermined evaluation protocols implemented by health care professionals for the diagnosis of ED during pregnancy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b3b","authors":["Amanda Maihara dos Santos","Gl\u00e1ucia Rosana Guerra Benute","Niraldo Oliveira dos Santos","Roseli Mieko Yamamoto Nomura","Mara Cristina Souza de Lucia","Rossana Pulcineli Vieira Francisco"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.midw.2017.05.005","first_seen_on":"2017-05-09T12:54:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["02666138","1532-3099"],"journal":"Midwifery","last_mentioned_on":1499788893,"links":["http:\/\/www.midwiferyjournal.com\/article\/S0266-6138(17)30349-2\/fulltext?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0266613817303492","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28500866","http:\/\/www.midwiferyjournal.com\/article\/S0266-6138(17)30349-2\/fulltext"],"pmid":"28500866","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","obstetrics"],"title":"PRESENCE OF EATING DISORDERS AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN PREGNANT WOMEN","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/presence-eating-disorders-relationship-anxiety-depression-pregnant-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.05,"score_history":{"1y":6.05,"6m":6.05,"3m":5.8,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8193064,"mean":6.9264840328884,"rank":1333379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6855627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8193064,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237978,"mean":12.405768036407,"rank":55002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":182700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237978,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":921,"mean":6.0097434782609,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":921,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":8.2994117647059,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ZW":1,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GLLuxardi\/statuses\/865290271235481600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19976748],"posted_on":"2017-05-18T19:37:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Gian Luigi Luxardi","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2928203160\/306b20da1bc2d0c1a36dd6e979485b26_normal.jpeg","description":"psicologo-psicoterapeuta\r\nresponsabile Centro per i Disturbi Alimentari di San Vito al Tagliamento (PN)\r\nPresidente Eletto della sezione Triveneta della SISDCA","id_on_source":"GLLuxardi","tweeter_id":"984671624","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":110},"tweet_id":"865290271235481600"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/arizonamidwife\/statuses\/861926236083433476","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19976748],"posted_on":"2017-05-09T12:50:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Alicia Witt, LM, CPM","url":"http:\/\/www.arizonamidwife.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/675423737861160960\/_dky35rd_normal.jpg","description":"Licensed Arizona Midwife and CPM (Certified Professional Midwives).
