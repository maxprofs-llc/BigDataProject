The overall OR for recurrence was 0.516 (95% CI 0.342-0.920, p=0.022), suggesting that the introduction of moxifloxacin into the recommended regimen reduces TB relapse after treatment. In the safety analysis, the overall OR was estimated to be 1.001 (95% CI 0.855-1.172, p=0.989), demonstrating that adding moxifloxacin to the recommended regimen does not cause more adverse events during TB treatment.\nThis meta-analysis suggests that the introduction of moxifloxacin into the recommended regimen for the treatment of non-drug resistant TB improves the clinical outcome by elevating the culture conversion rate and reducing the recurrence rate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c89","authors":["Xu, Ping","Chen, Hui","Xu, Junchi","Wu, Minjuan","Zhu, Xiaoyan","Wang, Fengping","Chen, Sufang","Xu, Junhua","Ping Xu","Hui Chen","Junchi Xu","Minjuan Wu","Xiaoyan Zhu","Fengping Wang","Sufang Chen","Junhua Xu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijid.2017.05.003","first_seen_on":"2017-05-09T08:08:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1201-9712","12019712","1878-3511"],"journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1494536795,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijidonline.com\/article\/S1201-9712(17)30139-X\/fulltext"],"pmid":"28495364","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Moxifloxacin is an effective and safe candidate agent for tuberculosis treatment: a meta-analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/moxifloxacin-effective-safe-candidate-agent-tuberculosis-treatment-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":1.1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187776,"mean":6.9233436649085,"rank":4311988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3847855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187776,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237389,"mean":12.414822518408,"rank":130336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":105507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237389,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1284,"mean":5.1086126266563,"rank":708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1284,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":4.6620317460317,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
