The diagnosis of genetic epilepsies makes the patient assured of the reasons of his\/her seizures and avoids unnecessary, expensive, and invasive investigations. Last decade has shown tremendous growth in gene sequencing technologies, which have made genetic tests available at the bedside. Whole exome sequencing is now being routinely used in the clinical setting for making a genetic diagnosis. Genetic testing not only makes the diagnosis but also has an effect on the management of the patients, for example, the role of sodium channels blockers in SCN1A+ Dravet syndrome patients and usefulness of ketogenic diet therapy in SLC2A1+ generalized epilepsy patients. Many clinicians in our country have no or limited knowledge about the molecular genetics of epilepsies, types of genetic tests available, how to access them and how to interpret the results. The purpose of this review is to give an overview in this direction and encourage the clinicians to start considering genetic testing as an important investigation along with electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging for better understanding and management of epilepsy in their patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51b3cf058f6100038cd","authors":["Dhiman","Vikas Dhiman"],"doi":"10.4103\/aian.aian_447_16","first_seen_on":"2017-05-09T06:51:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0972-2327"],"issue":"2","journal":"Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1502392763,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4103\/aian.aian_447_16","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28615892?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28615892?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.annalsofian.org\/article.asp?issn=0972-2327%3Byear%3D2017%3Bvolume%3D20%3Bissue%3D2%3Bspage%3D96%3Bepage%3D102%3Baulast%3DDhiman#.WYyxq0qfejY.facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.annalsofian.org\/article.asp?issn=0972-2327;year=2017;volume=20;issue=2;spage=96;epage=102;aulast=Dhiman;type=2","pmcid":"PMC5470162","pmid":"28615892","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Molecular genetics of epilepsy: A clinician's perspective","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-genetics-epilepsy-clinicians-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3.25,"6m":3.25,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422150,"mean":7.0862484425213,"rank":2081301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6300617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422150,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248415,"mean":12.576419404703,"rank":80183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":167236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248415,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290,"mean":4.271937716263,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":3,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EpilepticDanio\/statuses\/875655815436263426","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19971065],"posted_on":"2017-06-16T10:06:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Epilepsy & Zebrafish","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/894208500817170437\/b0xsJZl5_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"EpilepticDanio","tweeter_id":"872858535297679360","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":9},"tweet_id":"875655815436263426"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/876148204663848960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19971065],"posted_on":"2017-06-17T18:43:04+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
