This study aimed to establish the reliability of aphasia assessment across the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) using Access2Aphasia, and compare it with face-to-face (FTF) assessment. Consumer perspectives of Access2Aphasia were also examined.\nThirty PWA were randomized into two conditions: online-led and FTF assessment. Participants in the online-led group were assessed remotely using Access2Aphasia\u2122 in their own homes, while an FTF SLP scored silently simultaneously. Participants in the FTF group were assessed FTF using standard administration materials. Assessment included two subtests of the Psycholinguistic Assessment of Language Processing Activities (PALPA) and the Assessment of Living with Aphasia (ALA) to allow for outcomes to be captured across the ICF domains. Consumer perspectives on Access2Aphasia were obtained from both PWA and research SLPs in the online-led group.\nKappa statistics indicated moderate to almost perfect agreement between online and FTF SLPs (k\u2009=\u20090.71-1.00). Intrarater and interrater reliability was excellent (ICC\u2009=\u20090.99-1.00) and equivalent for the online-led and FTF conditions. Both PWA and research SLPs in the online-led group reported being satisfied with the experience overall, with suggestions provided by research SLPs to improve Access2Aphasia.\nThis study supports the provision of iPad-based aphasia assessments across the ICF in the online environment, with comparable reliability to FTF assessments. Future research is warranted to support the development of iPad-based aphasia assessment and treatment as an alternative mode of service delivery to PWA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008aff","authors":["GuoYiting Emily","TogherLeanne","PowerEmma","HutomoEdwin","YangYi-Fei","TayArthur","YenShih-Cheng","KohGerald Choon-Huat"],"doi":"10.1089\/tmj.2016.0072","first_seen_on":"2016-11-03T00:18:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1556-3669","1530-5627"],"journal":"Telemedicine Journal (now called Telemedicine Journal and e-Health)","last_mentioned_on":1494405372,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/tmj.2016.0072?ai=sn&mi=o0fy&af=R","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/tmj.2016.0072"],"pmid":"27802112","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["healthservices","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Assessment of Aphasia Across the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Using an iPad-Based Application","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-aphasia-across-international-classification-functioning-disability-health-using-ipadbased-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":4100863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3873571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240794,"mean":13.043980373183,"rank":123614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":108665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240794,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":846,"mean":4.947973964497,"rank":480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":846,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.28,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CostaisaGroup\/statuses\/793970458156826624","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13290150],"posted_on":"2016-11-03T00:18:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Costaisa","url":"http:\/\/www.costaisa.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000801144129\/39e34d2156e7b8e92ccc75dcc502f9de_normal.png","description":"Partner global en salud: externalizaci\u00f3n de servicios en tecnolog\u00edas de la informaci\u00f3n, consultor\u00eda, y desarrollo e implementaci\u00f3n de soluciones tecnol\u00f3gicas","id_on_source":"CostaisaGroup","tweeter_id":"390677336","geo":{"lt":40,"ln":-4,"country":"ES"},"followers":878},"tweet_id":"793970458156826624"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/wespeechies\/statuses\/862224741825863680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13290150],"posted_on":"2017-05-10T08:36:12+00:00","author":{"name":"WeSpeechies","url":"http:\/\/speech-language-therapy.com\/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=147","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/440957173342818304\/zqDVNTsm_normal.png","description":"Welcome to the speech language professionals' global #RoCur.
