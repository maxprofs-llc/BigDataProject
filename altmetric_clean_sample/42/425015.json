This study characterizes the default-mode network activity in late-life depression and the correlation of the default-mode network activity changes with the white-matter hyperintensities burden. We hypothesized that elderly depressed subjects would have altered default-mode network activity, which would correlate with the increased white-matter hyperintensities burden. Twelve depressed subjects (mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 19.8\u00b14.1, mean age 70.5\u00b14.9) and 12 non-depressed, comparison subjects (mean age 69\u00b16.5) were included. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected while subjects performed a low cognitive load, event-related task. We compared the default-mode network activity in these groups (including depressed subjects pre- and post-antidepressant treatment). We analyzed the resting connectivity patterns of the posterior cingulate cortex. Deconvolution was used to evaluate the correlation of resting-state connectivity scores with the white-matter hyperintensities burden. Compared with non-depressed elderly, depressed subjects pretreatment had decreased connectivity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and increased connectivity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the orbito-frontal cortex. The abnormal connectivity was significantly correlated with the white-matter hyperintensities burden. Remitted elderly depressed subjects had improved functional connectivity compared to pretreatment, although alterations persisted in the anterior cingulate and the prefrontal cortex when remitted elderly depressed subjects were compared with non-depressed elderly. Our study provides evidence for altered default-mode network connectivity in late-life depression. The correlation between white-matter hyperintensities burden and default-mode network connectivity emphasizes the role of vascular changes in late-life depression etiopathogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d3","doi":"10.1016\/j.pscychresns.2011.04.003","first_seen_on":"2011-10-23T14:06:22+00:00","funders":["phs"],"issns":["09254927"],"journal":"Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging Section","last_mentioned_on":1319376657,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0925492711001235"],"pmid":"21824753","pubdate":"2011-08-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ireland Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Default-mode network connectivity and white matter burden in late-life depression ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/defaultmode-network-connectivity-white-matter-burden-latelife-depression-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2671267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1694404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72149,"mean":4.5631212230415,"rank":31724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":26568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72149,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":1.9091575562701,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.29,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
