In the perspective of improving large area graphene quality, we have investigated in real-time the CVD kinetics using CH(4)-H(2) precursors on both polycrystalline copper and nickel. We highlighted the role of hydrogen in differentiating the growth kinetics and thickness of graphene on copper and nickel. Specifically, the growth kinetics and mechanism is framed in the competitive dissociative chemisorption of H(2) and dehydrogenating chemisorption of CH(4), and in the competition of the in-diffusion of carbon and hydrogen, being hydrogen in-diffusion faster in copper than nickel, while carbon diffusion is faster in nickel than copper. It is shown that hydrogen acts as an inhibitor for the CH(4) dehydrogenation on copper, contributing to suppress deposition onto the copper substrate, and degrades quality of graphene. Additionally, the evidence of the role of hydrogen in forming C-H out of plane defects in CVD graphene on Cu is also provided. Conversely, resurfacing recombination of hydrogen aids CH(4) decomposition in the case of Ni. Understanding better and providing other elements to the kinetics of graphene growth is helpful to define the optimal CH(4)\/H(2) ratio, which ultimately can contribute to improve graphene layer thickness uniformity even on polycrystalline substrates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011PCCP...1320836L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","doi":"10.1039\/c1cp22347j","first_seen_on":"2011-10-20T05:15:09+00:00","issns":["1463-9084"],"journal":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP)","last_mentioned_on":1319085772,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22006173?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22006173","pubdate":"2011-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Graphene CVD growth on copper and nickel: role of hydrogen in kinetics and structure.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/graphene-cvd-growth-copper-nickel-role-hydrogen-kinetics-structure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2671794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71476,"mean":4.5707584190276,"rank":31242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":27837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71476,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2304,"mean":2.4060356057317,"rank":811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2304,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":1.6302083333333,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":34,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
