Despite well-established criteria, this diagnosis is often missed or substantially delayed (Table 1). In this case, a precipitous cognitive decline associated with a urinary tract infection initiallysuggested delirium. Although atypical CJD was considered as a cause when symptoms persisted, a definitive diagnosis was established postmortem when the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prion protein 14-3-3 tested positive. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis of rapidly progressive dementia as Connecticut accounts for approximately three of the more than 200 cases diagnosed nationally.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa69f3cf058f610009a00","first_seen_on":"2011-10-24T16:50:44+00:00","issns":["0010-6178"],"issue":"8","journal":"Connecticut Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1319475613,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21980678"],"pmid":"21980678","pubdate":"2011-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Atypical presentation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: a rare but important cause of rapidly progressive dementia.","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atypical-presentation-creutzfeldtjakob-disease-rare-important-cause-rapidly-progressive-dementia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2496116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2389562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72334,"mean":4.5518620823137,"rank":29067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":41078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72334,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":1.9086666666667,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/CJDBlogger\/status\/128513604965244928","citation_ids":[426682],"posted_on":"2011-10-24T16:50:05+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"CJDBlogger","tweeter_id":27526484},"tweet_id":"128513604965244928"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Atypical presentation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease:...
