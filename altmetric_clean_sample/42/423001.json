A dramatic escalation in drug intake with extended access to drug self-administration is characterized by a dysregulation of brain reward pathways. Hormonal studies using an experimenter-administered cocaine binge model and an escalation self-administration model have revealed large increases in ACTH and corticosterone in rats during an acute binge with attenuation during the chronic binge stage and a reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during acute withdrawal. The activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with cocaine appears to depend on feed-forward activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. At the same time, escalation in drug intake with either extended access or dependence-induction produces an activation of the brain stress system's corticotropin-releasing factor outside of the hypothalamus in the extended amygdala, which is particularly evident during acute withdrawal. A model of the role of different levels of hormonal\/brain stress activation in addiction is presented that has heuristic value for understanding individual vulnerability to drug dependence and novel treatments for the disorder.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002216","authors":["George Koob","Mary Jeanne Kreek"],"doi":"10.1176\/appi.ajp.2007.05030503","endpage":"1159","first_seen_on":"2011-10-21T18:22:16+00:00","issns":["0002-953X","1535-7228"],"issue":"8","journal":"American Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1480344674,"links":["http:\/\/ajp.psychiatryonline.org\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/164\/8\/1149","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1176\/appi.ajp.2007.05030503","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17671276","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2837343","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2837343"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajp.psychiatryonline.org\/cgi\/reprint\/164\/8\/1149.pdf","pmid":"17671276","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Am Psychiatric Assoc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1149","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Stress, Dysregulation of Drug Reward Pathways, and the Transition to Drug Dependence","type":"article","volume":"164","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stress-dysregulation-drug-reward-pathways-transition-drug-dependence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.5,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":1182241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6633584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84507,"mean":5.0671656923769,"rank":12312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":72117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84507,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4723,"mean":10.842287590004,"rank":1179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":3538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4723,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.4543636363636,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":6,"Professor > Associate Professor":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Researcher":36,"Student  > Ph.
