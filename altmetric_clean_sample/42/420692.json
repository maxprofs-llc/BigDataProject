Particularly, Illumina\/Solexa sequencing has had an increasing impact on gathering data from model and non-model organisms. However, accurate and easy to use tools for quality filtering have not yet been established. We present ConDeTri, a method for content dependent read trimming for next generation sequencing data using quality scores of each individual base. The main focus of the method is to remove sequencing errors from reads so that sequencing reads can be standardized. Another aspect of the method is to incorporate read trimming in next-generation sequencing data processing and analysis pipelines. It can process single-end and paired-end sequence data of arbitrary length and it is independent from sequencing coverage and user interaction. ConDeTri is able to trim and remove reads with low quality scores to save computational time and memory usage during de novo assemblies. Low coverage or large genome sequencing projects will especially gain from trimming reads. The method can easily be incorporated into preprocessing and analysis pipelines for Illumina data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Linn\u00e9a Smeds","Axel K\u00fcnstner"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0026314","first_seen_on":"2011-10-20T02:03:12+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1440800447,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0026314","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0026314","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0026314"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0026314.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3198461","pmid":"22039460","pubdate":"2011-10-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e26314","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"ConDeTri - A Content Dependent Read Trimmer for Illumina Data","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/condetri-content-dependent-read-trimmer-illumina-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5560775,"mean":6.3848950815131,"rank":936742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":4620887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5560775,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73684,"mean":4.7969721102561,"rank":11127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":62503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73684,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96007,"mean":9.6504688456972,"rank":20534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":75389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96007,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1898,"mean":7.7539356879283,"rank":406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1898,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Ph.
