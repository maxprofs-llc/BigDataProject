The KIT, PDGFR-\u03b1, and VEGFR2 genes are frequently amplified and expressed in HGG and are molecular targets for therapeutic inhibition by the small-molecule kinase inhibitor sunitinib malate. Twenty-one patients with progressive HGG after prior radiotherapy and chemotherapy received a daily dose of 37.5 mg sunitinib until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-enhanced perfusion measurements were performed before and during therapy. Cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) lesion-to-normal-white matter ratios were measured to evaluate the antiangiogenic effects of sunitinib. The most frequent grade \u22653 adverse events were skin toxicity, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia. None of the patients achieved an objective response, whereas a decrease in CBV and CBF within the lesion compared with the normal brain was documented in four out of 14 (29%) patients evaluable for DSC-enhanced perfusion measurements. All patients experienced progression of their disease before or after eight weeks of therapy. Median time-to-progression and overall survival were 1.6 (95%CI 0.8-2.5) and 3.8 (95% CI 2.2-5.3) months, respectively. No correlation could be established between VEGFR2, PDGFR-\u03b1, and KIT gene copy numbers or protein expression and the effects of sunitinib. Single-agent sunitinib at 37.5 mg\/day had insufficient activity to warrant further investigation of this monotherapy regimen in recurrent HGG.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8f","doi":"10.1007\/s11060-010-0402-7","first_seen_on":"2011-10-26T13:43:41+00:00","issns":["1573-7373"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Neuro-Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1319635842,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20872043?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"20872043","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","neurology"],"title":"Phase II study of sunitinib malate in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phase-ii-study-sunitinib-malate-patients-recurrent-highgrade-glioma-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2671715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1696070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72236,"mean":4.5818453935073,"rank":31353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":28463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72236,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":816,"mean":1.9881398773006,"rank":293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":816,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":1.5617073170732,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
