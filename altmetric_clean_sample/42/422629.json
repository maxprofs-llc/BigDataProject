The fabrication process is investigated in detail, considering factors like the fiber-drawing velocity, solution viscosity, and surface tension. These bioinspired fibers are inexpensive and durable, which makes it possible to collect water from fog in a similar manner to a spider's web.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008951","authors":["Bai H","Sun R","Ju J","Yao X","Zheng Y","Jiang L","Bai, Hao","Sun, Ruize","Ju, Jie","Yao, Xi","Zheng, Yongmei","Jiang, Lei"],"doi":"10.1002\/smll.201101408","endpage":"3433","first_seen_on":"2011-10-21T12:43:26+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1613-6829","1613-6810","16136810"],"issue":"24","journal":"Small","last_mentioned_on":1329098400,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/smll.201101408\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/smll.201101408","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/smll.201101408","http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/smll.201101408"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/smll.201101408\/pdf","pmid":"22021053","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"3429","subjects":["biomedicalengineering","nanotechnology"],"title":"Large\u00e2\u0080\u0090Scale Fabrication of Bioinspired Fibers for Directional Water Collection","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/largescale-fabrication-bioinspired-fibers-directional-water-collection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6380092,"mean":5.985707906047,"rank":311846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":6068805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6380092,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74352,"mean":4.8764786485723,"rank":3407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":70929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74352,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1392,"mean":4.8406427030913,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1392,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":1.9925490196078,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
