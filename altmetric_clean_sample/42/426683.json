The N171S PrP polymorphism is found mainly in humans of African descent, but its low incidence has precluded study of its possible influence on prion disease. Similar to previous experiments of others, for laboratory studies we created a transgenic model expressing the mouse PrP homolog, PrP-170S, of human PrP-171S. Since PrP polymorphisms can vary in their effects on different TSE diseases, we tested these mice with four different strains of mouse-adapted scrapie. Whereas 22L and ME7 scrapie strains induced typical clinical disease, neuropathology and accumulation of PrPres in all transgenic mice at 99-128 average days post-inoculation, strains RML and 79A produced clinical disease and PrPres formation in only a small subset of mice at very late times. When mice expressing both PrP-170S and PrP-170N were inoculated with RML scrapie, dominant-negative inhibition of disease did not occur, possibly because interaction of strain RML with PrP-170S was minimal. Surprisingly, in vitro PrP conversion using protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), did not reproduce the in vivo findings, suggesting that the resistance noted in live mice might be due to factors or conditions not present in vitro. These findings suggest that in vivo conversion of PrP-170S by RML and 79A scrapie strains was slow and inefficient. PrP-170S mice may be an example of the conformational selection model where the structure of some prion strains does not favor interactions with PrP molecules expressing certain polymorphisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334c","doi":"10.1371\/journal.ppat.1002275","first_seen_on":"2011-10-24T16:50:48+00:00","issns":["1553-7374"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1319474702,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21980292"],"pmid":"21980292","pubdate":"2011-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Strain specific resistance to murine scrapie associated with a naturally occurring human prion protein polymorphism at residue 171.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strain-specific-resistance-murine-scrapie-associated-naturally-occurring-human-prion-protein-polymor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2496911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2389272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72338,"mean":4.5466935316643,"rank":29064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":41093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72338,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3824,"mean":10.159815328276,"rank":2650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3824,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":4.7397235772358,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
