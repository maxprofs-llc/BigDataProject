We employed high-resolution X-ray reciprocal space mapping, which allows us to resolve the average particle shape from the quantitative analysis of intensity diffraction rods running perpendicular to corresponding facet surfaces. We identified the oxygen induced formation of nanosized (112) facets which is reversible in a CO atmosphere. Our results give direct evidence for the microscopic evolution of the nanoparticle shape under reactant exposure, which is essential for an atomistic understanding of catalytic reactions on nanoparticles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011NanoL..11.4697N","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Philipp Nolte","Andreas Stierle","Nikolai Kasper","N.
