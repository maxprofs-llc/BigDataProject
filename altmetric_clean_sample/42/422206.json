We comprehensively evaluated 23 germline sequence variants (from published literature) in 17 genes from 7 biological pathways associated with the HNC survival. Because cancer prognosis correlates with disease aggressiveness, the factors that determine aggressive disease may influence field cancerization process to favor SPC development. We thus hypothesized that the same sequence variants associated with HNC survival can also be associated with SPC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002494","doi":"10.1002\/cncr.26446","first_seen_on":"2011-10-21T04:24:48+00:00","issns":["1097-0142"],"journal":"Cancer (0008543X)","last_mentioned_on":1319168998,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22009713?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22009713","pubdate":"2011-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Genetic sequence variants and the development of secondary primary cancers in patients with head and neck cancers.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-sequence-variants-development-secondary-primary-cancers-patients-head-neck-cancers-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2671705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1696086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71642,"mean":4.5792158680085,"rank":31298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":27920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71642,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3538,"mean":9.3530359061351,"rank":2526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3538,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":2.896447761194,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
