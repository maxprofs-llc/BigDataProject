The cases of mental disorder were identified by clinically trained interviewers with the aid of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Clinician Version. The lifetime prevalence of the targeted psychiatric disorders was 50.8%, and its point prevalence was 37.3%. The commonest disorders were nicotine dependence, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. Nearly 37% of subjects with a psychiatric disorder had two or more diagnoses. Mental illness was associated with family income, financial independence, type of academic discipline, violence from men, social support, and self-esteem. Psychiatric disorders are common among female university students. Serious attention should be paid to preventive and therapeutic programs in this group.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e6f","doi":"10.1097\/nmd.0b013e31821cd29c","first_seen_on":"2011-10-23T07:56:08+00:00","issns":["1539-736X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease","last_mentioned_on":1354485167,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21629015"],"pmid":"21629015","pubdate":"2011-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Prevalence, comorbidity, and correlates of DSM-IV axis I mental disorders among female university students.","type":"article","volume":"199","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-comorbidity-correlates-dsmiv-axis-i-mental-disorders-among-female-university-students-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":1929043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2537237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70114,"mean":4.1605129719167,"rank":22360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":47003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70114,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1368,"mean":3.1251221653255,"rank":558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1368,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":1.3067307692308,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
