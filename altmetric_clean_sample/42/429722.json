Governments are introducing free health care to improve health outcomes. Free health care affects treatment seeking, and it is therefore assumed to lead to improved health outcomes, but there is no direct trial evidence of the impact of removing out-of-pocket payments on health outcomes in developing countries. This trial was designed to test the impact of free health care on health outcomes directly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334b","authors":["Evelyn Korkor Ansah","Solomon Narh-Bana","Sabina Asiamah","Vivian Dzordzordzi","Kingsley Biantey","Kakra Dickson","John Owusu Gyapong","Kwadwo Ansah Koram","Brian M Greenwood","Anne Mills","Christopher J.
