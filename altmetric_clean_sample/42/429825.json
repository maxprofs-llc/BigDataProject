The extract was separated on an ODS C18 column (2.3 \u03bcm, 100 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm I.D.) by gradient elution with (A) water containing 50mM AcONH(4) and (B) acetonitrile. The wavelength was set at 265 nm and the injection volume was 10 \u03bcL. Under these conditions, the calibration curve was linear over the concentration range 0.2-20 \u03bcg\/mL with a correlation coefficient of r(2)=0.9992. The inter- and intraday precision levels were less than 7% and the accuracies (%) were within the range 92.0-102.5%. The method was sufficiently valid to be applied to a pharmacokinetics study of psilocin in rat plasma. The pharmacokinetic parameters of psilocin in rat plasma after the oral administration of a G. spectabilis extract were as follows: C(max), 0.43 \u00b1 0.12 \u03bcg\/mL; T(max), 90 \u00b1 2.1 min; AUC(0\u2192t), 1238.3 \u00b1 96.4 (\u03bcg\/mL) min; and T(1\/2), 117.3 \u00b1 40.3 min.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf7","doi":"10.1016\/j.jchromb.2011.07.003","first_seen_on":"2011-10-26T14:44:18+00:00","issns":["1873-376X"],"issue":"25","journal":"Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical & Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1319638074,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21820980?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21820980","pubdate":"2011-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Determining the pharmacokinetics of psilocin in rat plasma using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode array detector after orally administering an extract of Gymnopilus spectabilis.","type":"article","volume":"879","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determining-pharmacokinetics-psilocin-rat-plasma-using-ultraperformance-liquid-chromatography-couple"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2671697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1696052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72238,"mean":4.5822895745947,"rank":31357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":28423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72238,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":680,"mean":1.9547216494845,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":680,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":0.609375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
