Based on previous short-term results, we examined the long-term effects of adenovirus vector-mediated overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A(165) (VEGF-A(165)) in the uterine artery (UtA). Transit-time flow probes were implanted around both UtAs of mid-gestation pregnant sheep (n=11) to measure UABF. A carotid artery catheter was inserted to measure maternal or fetal hemodynamics. Baseline UABF was measured over 3 days, before injection of adenovirus vector (5 \u00d7 10(11) particles) encoding the VEGF-A(165) gene (Ad.VEGF-A(165)) into one UtA and a reporter \u03b2-galactosidase gene (Ad.LacZ) contralaterally. UABF was then measured daily until term. At 4 weeks post injection, the increase in UABF was significantly higher in Ad.VEGF-A(165) compared with Ad.LacZ-transduced UtAs (36.53% vs 20.08%, P=0.02). There was no significant effect on maternal and fetal blood pressure. Organ bath studies showed significantly lesser vasoconstriction (E(max) 154.1 vs 184.7, P<0.001), whereas immunohistochemistry demonstrated a significantly increased number of adventitial blood vessels (140 vs 91, n=26, P<0.05) following Ad.VEGF-A(165) transduction. Local overexpression of VEGF-A(165) in the UtAs of pregnant mid-gestation sheep leads to a sustained long-term increase in UABF, which may be explained by neovascularization and altered vascular reactivity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002934","doi":"10.1038\/gt.2011.158","first_seen_on":"2011-10-21T11:40:56+00:00","funders":["mrc","bhf"],"issns":["1476-5462"],"journal":"Gene Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1319195975,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22011641?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22011641","pubdate":"2011-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Long-term increase in uterine blood flow is achieved by local overexpression of VEGF-A(165) in the uterine arteries of pregnant sheep.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-increase-uterine-blood-flow-achieved-local-overexpression-vegfa165-uterine-arteries-pregnan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":2656315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1713128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71681,"mean":4.6254111328124,"rank":31895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":25246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71681,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":539,"mean":4.9200743494424,"rank":333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":539,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.7119285714286,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
