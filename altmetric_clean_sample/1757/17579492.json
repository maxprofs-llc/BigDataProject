But when a thin layer of SnO2 is coated over Cu nanoparticles, the reduction becomes Sn-thickness dependent - the thicker (1.8 nm) shell shows Sn-like activity to generate formate while the thinner (0.8 nm) shell is selective to the formation of CO with the conversion Faradaic efficiency (FE) reaching 93% at -0.7 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). Theoretical calculations suggest that the 0.8 nm SnO2 shell likely alloys with trace of Cu, causing the SnO2 lattice to be uniaxially compressed and favored for the production of CO over formate. The report demonstrates a new strategy to tune NP catalyst selectivity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 via the tunable core\/shell structure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Qing Li","Jiaju Fu","Wenlei Zhu","Zhengzheng Chen","Bo Shen","Liheng Wu","Zheng Xi","Tanyuan Wang","Gang Lu","Jun-jie Zhu","Shouheng Sun"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.7b00261","first_seen_on":"2017-03-17T08:00:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1493061075,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.7b00261","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jacs.7b00261"],"pmid":"28291338","pubdate":"2017-03-17T22:28:41+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Tuning Sn-Catalysis for Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to CO via the Core\/Shell Cu\/SnO2 Structure","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.7b00261","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tuning-sncatalysis-electrochemical-reduction-co2-co-via-coreshell-cusno2-structure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":9.25,"6m":9.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200553,"mean":6.9378243362089,"rank":911448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7277165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200553,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257721,"mean":13.20141359615,"rank":46044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":211055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257721,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19050,"mean":5.2720449367421,"rank":2372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":16610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19050,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256,"mean":10.868345098039,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
