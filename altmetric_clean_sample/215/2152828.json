To address this gap in the literature, the current study drew upon assumptions from social-cognitive and behavioral theories that are implicit in CRE design to assess the influence of short-term changes from pre- to posttreatment in behaviors and commitment on changes in relationship quality among a racially and economically diverse group of 2,824 individuals who participated in a CRE program. Findings from structural equation modeling indicated that the best-fitting model for both men and women was one in which changes in behaviors predicted changes in relationship quality via their influence on changes in commitment. Further, a series of moderational analyses provided some evidence to suggest that the strength of the relationships between these variables may depend to a small extent on the social address of the participants (race, income) and to a greater extent on characteristics of the CRE experience (i.e., beginning the class at lower levels of functioning, attending with a partner). Findings help us begin to understand the influences among domains of change that occur as a result of participating in a CRE program, as well as offering some useful information to practitioners on demographic and contextual moderators of program outcomes. Implications for future research on the mechanisms of change for CRE are presented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002da3","authors":["Rauer AJ","Adler-Baeder F","Lucier-Greer M","Skuban E","Ketring SA","Smith T"],"doi":"10.1037\/a0035502","endpage":"76","first_seen_on":"2014-02-28T15:05:05+00:00","issns":["0893-3200 (Print)","0893-3200","1939-1293"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Family Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1474364374,"links":["http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/fam\/28\/1\/65","http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=2014-04342-001","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037\/a0035502"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/fam\/28\/1\/65.pdf","pmid":"24512285","pubdate":"2014-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Psychological Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"65","title":"Exploring processes of change in couple relationship education: Predictors of change in relationship quality.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-processes-change-couple-relationship-education-predictors-change-relationship-quality"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.664,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.664},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":749747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7659528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177391,"mean":7.946437183607,"rank":19203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":158188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177391,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1320,"mean":4.9546762699014,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1320,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":8.6676470588235,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
