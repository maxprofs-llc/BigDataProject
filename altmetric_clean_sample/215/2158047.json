This, however, is a prerequisite for drawing conclusions on normal cognitive development, and understanding deviant maturation. The aim of this study is to longitudinally investigate 6 subcomponents of EF in early (mean age 11) and late adolescence (mean age 19) and to investigate the influence of sex and socioeconomic status (SES).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67d3cf058f61000983f","authors":["Boelema SR","Harakeh Z","Ormel J","Hartman CA","Vollebergh WA","van Zandvoort MJ","Sarai R.
