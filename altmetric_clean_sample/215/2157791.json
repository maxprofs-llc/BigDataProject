General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in diagnosing and managing dementia; however, there are gaps between recommended and current practice. The aim of this study was to explore GPs' reported practice in diagnosing and managing dementia and to describe, in theoretical terms, the proposed explanations for practice that was and was not consistent with evidence-based guidelines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000834","authors":["Kerry Murphy","Denise A O\u2019Connor","Colette J Browning","Simon D French","Susan Michie","Jill J Francis","Grant M Russell","Barbara Workman","Leon Flicker","Martin P Eccles","Sally E Green","Murphy, K.","Murphy K","O Connor DA","Browning CJ","French SD","Michie S","Francis JJ","Russell GM","Workman B","Flicker L","Eccles MP","Green SE"],"doi":"10.1186\/1748-5908-9-31","first_seen_on":"2014-03-03T16:13:15+00:00","issns":["1748-5908",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Implementation Science","last_mentioned_on":1456832295,"links":["http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/9\/1\/31\/abstract","http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/9\/1\/31","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1748-5908-9-31.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4015883\/","http:\/\/openaccess.city.ac.uk\/4854\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/pdf\/1748-5908-9-31.pdf","pmid":"24581339","pubdate":"2014-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"31","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Understanding diagnosis and management of dementia and guideline implementation in general practice: a qualitative study using the theoretical domains framework","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/implementationscience.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1748-5908-9-31","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/understanding-diagnosis-management-dementia-guideline-implementation-general-practice-qualitative-st-9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7325869,"mean":6.3768565404091,"rank":1616430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5677588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7325869,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171768,"mean":7.5738280461325,"rank":41466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":129507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171768,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":982,"mean":9.4810621814475,"rank":578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":982,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":13.713636363636,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
