Multiple tumors throughout the small intestine were found in 15 patients (58%) and duodenal and colonic mucosal lesions in 8 and 6 cases, respectively. Histologically, intramucosal tumor spread and a zone of neoplastic intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) neighboring the main transmural tumors were detected in 20 (91%) and 17 (77%) of the 22 cases examined, respectively. Inside and outside the IEL zone, some degree of enteropathy with many reactive small IELs and villous atrophy was detected in 11 cases (50%). Immunohistologically, many CD56\/CD8-positive small IELs were found in the enteropathic lesions of 4 (36%) and 7 (64%) of these 11 cases. Lymphoma cells expressed tyrosine kinase receptor c-Met, serial phosphorylated (p)-mitogen-activated protein kinase\/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Myc, and Bcl2 in 18 (78%), 21 (91%), 11 (42%), and 19 (73%) of the total cases, respectively. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromosomal loci 7q31 (c-Met) and 8q24 (c-Myc) were amplified in 11 (65%) and 12 (71%) of the 17 cases analyzed. Gain of 7q31 and c-Met expression were significantly (P < .01) higher than in peripheral CD8-positive T-cell or CD56-positive natural killer-cell lymphomas. Enteropathy was seen near the IEL zone in type II EATL, and activation of the c-Met, mitogen-activated protein kinase\/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and c-Myc-Bcl2-mediated cell survival may play important roles in lymphomagenesis, converting enteropathy to type II EATL. Seven cases in the early clinical stages I and II-1 showed significantly (P < .01) better prognoses than did those in the advanced stages. Early detection of the mucosal lesions and tumors may improve patient prognosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007680","authors":["Kikuma, Kanta","Yamada, Kozue","Nakamura, Shotaro","MT, Akiko Ogami","Nimura, Satoshi","Hirahashi, Minako","Yonemasu, Hirotoshi","Urabe, Shogo","Naito, Shinji","Matsuki, Yasumasa","Sadahira, Yoshito","Takeshita, Morishige"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.humpath.2013.10.038","first_seen_on":"2014-03-03T14:47:31+00:00","issns":["0046-8177","1532-8392"],"journal":"Human Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1398160989,"links":["http:\/\/www.humanpathol.com\/article\/S0046-8177(14)00084-7\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24746558?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.humanpathol.com\/article\/S0046-8177(14)00084-7\/pdf","pmid":"24746558","pubdate":"2014-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Detailed clinicopathological characteristics and possible lymphomagenesis of type II intestinal enteropathy\u2013associated T-cell lymphoma in Japan","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detailed-clinicopathological-characteristics-possible-lymphomagenesis-type-ii-intestinal-enteropathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":3550694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":838503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122700,"mean":8.5759305943818,"rank":82138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122700,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":908,"mean":1.9480771775083,"rank":597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":908,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.2538461538462,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Other":4,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":10,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/status\/458546539259244544","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2157518],"posted_on":"2014-04-22T10:03:09+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":221},"tweet_id":"458546539259244544"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HumanPathology\/status\/440498680722759681","license":"public","citation_ids":[2157518],"posted_on":"2014-03-03T14:47:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Human Pathology","url":"http:\/\/humpath.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566655604366643201\/4V2YSeun_normal.jpeg","description":"This Twitter is dedicated to human pathology and maintained by @jcfournet, surgical and molecular pathologist in Paris, France.","id_on_source":"HumanPathology","tweeter_id":"26601124","geo":{"lt":48.85341,"ln":2.3488,"country":"FR"},"followers":8983},"tweet_id":"440498680722759681"}]}}
