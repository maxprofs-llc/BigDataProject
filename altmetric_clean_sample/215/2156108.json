The concept of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has evolved to emphasize the importance of plastic changes in tissue architecture, and the cross-communication of tumor cells with various cells in the stroma and with specific molecules in the extracellular matrix (ECM).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002391","doi":"10.1016\/j.bbagen.2014.02.004","first_seen_on":"2014-03-02T22:15:45+00:00","issns":["03044165"],"journal":"BBA - General Subjects","last_mentioned_on":1393798536,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0304416514000506"],"pmid":"24561266","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"TGF\u03b2 and matrix-regulated epithelial to mesenchymal transition","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tgf%CE%B2-matrixregulated-epithelial-mesenchymal-transition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3542232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":135975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108798,"mean":8.3326932544098,"rank":85676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108798,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285,"mean":2.3409788732394,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
