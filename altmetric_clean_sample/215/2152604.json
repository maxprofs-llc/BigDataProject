Freshly harvested mouse trachea is cut longitudinally through the trachealis muscle and mounted in a shallow walled chamber on a glass-bottomed dish. The trachea sample is positioned along its long axis to take advantage of the trachealis muscle to curl longitudinally. This allows imaging of ciliary motion in the profile view along the entire tracheal length. Videos at 200 frames\/sec are obtained using differential interference contrast microscopy and a high speed digital camera to allow quantitative analysis of cilia beat frequency and ciliary waveform. With the addition of fluorescent beads during imaging, cilia generated fluid flow also can be determined. The protocol time spans approximately 30 min, with 5 min for chamber preparation, 5-10 min for sample mounting, and 10-15 min for videomicroscopy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Richard Francis","Cecilia Lo"],"doi":"10.3791\/50343","first_seen_on":"2014-02-28T13:30:52+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1940-087X"],"journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1393538970,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/50343?utm_source=youtube"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/50343.pdf","pmid":"23963287","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"Ex vivo Method for High Resolution Imaging of Cilia Motility in Rodent Airway Epithelia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ltemgtex-vivoltemgt-method-high-resolution-imaging-cilia-motility-rodent-airway-epithelia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228985,"mean":5.9651782765876,"rank":5293588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132824,"mean":8.6629426530045,"rank":108844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132824,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3675,"mean":3.0164893848666,"rank":2929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3675,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":5.973962962963,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"video":[{"title":"Ex vivo Method for High Resolution Imaging of Cilia Motility in Rodent Airway Epithelia","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8uJpoeUZn54","image":"https:\/\/i1.ytimg.com\/vi\/8uJpoeUZn54\/hqdefault.jpg","license":"public","citation_ids":[2152604],"posted_on":"2014-02-27T22:09:30+00:00","summary":"To watch this video on jove.com, click here: http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/50343?utm_source=youtube\n\nAn easy and reliable technique for visualizing and quantifying airway cilia motility and cilia generated flow using mouse trachea is described.
