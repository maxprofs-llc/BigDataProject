Twenty-two non-professional adult Latin dancers attended two laboratory-based dance trials each. After familiarization and a standardized warm-up, a multi-stage (3 x 5-minute) incremental (based on song tempo) Afro-Cuban salsa choreography was performed while following a video displayed on a projection screen. Data were collected with a portable indirect calorimeter, a heart rate telemeter, and wrist-, hip-, and ankle-mounted ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers. Prediction equations for energy expenditure and step count were value calibrated using forced entry multiple regression and cross-validated using a delete-one jackknife approach with additional Bland-Altman analysis. The average dance intensity reached 6.09 \u00b1 0.96 kcal\/kg\/h and demanded 45.9 \u00b1 11.3% of the heart rate reserve. Predictive ability of the derived models was satisfactory, where R(2) = 0.80; SEE = 0.44 kcal\/kg\/h and R(2) = 0.74; SEE = 3 step\/min for energy expenditure and step count, respectively. Dependent t-tests indicated no differences between predicted and measured values for both energy expenditure (t65 = -0.25, p = 0.80) and step count (t65 = -0.89, p = 0.38). The 95% limits of agreement for energy expenditure and step count were -0.98 to 0.95 kcal\/kg\/h and -7 to 7 step\/min, respectively. Latin dance to salsa music elicits physiological responses representative of moderate to vigorous physical activity, and a wrist-worn accelerometer with simultaneous heart rate measurement constitutes a valid and reliable technique for the prediction of energy expenditure and step count during Latin dance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a23","authors":["Pablo A Domene","Chris Easton"],"doi":"10.12678\/1089-313x.18.1.29","first_seen_on":"2014-02-27T17:00:07+00:00","issns":["1089-313X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Dance Medicine & Science","last_mentioned_on":1407881759,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24568801","http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/jmrp\/jdms\/2014\/00000018\/00000001\/art00004?token=00511c41a254c3a4c92c7e2a46762c6b795d7a76674470234a4542673f7b2f267738703375686f49a"],"pmid":"24568801","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Performing Arts And Creative Writing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","sportsmedicine"],"title":"Combined triaxial accelerometry and heart rate telemetry for the physiological characterization of latin dance in non-professional adults.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combined-triaxial-accelerometry-heart-rate-telemetry-physiological-characterization-latin-dance-nonp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229690,"mean":5.9663798423984,"rank":939923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5287330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229690,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132024,"mean":8.6695652121223,"rank":26200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":105733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132024,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":1.2379032258065,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.83333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
