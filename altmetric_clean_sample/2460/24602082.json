The objective of the present study, thus, was to assess the safety profile of Reichardia picroide methanolic extract (RPE) and as well as on its antioxidant and antihemolytic actvities.\nThe acute toxicity of RPE was carried out based on OECD guidelines 425. Signs accompanying toxicity and possible death of animals were monitored for two weeks to ascertain the median lethal dose (LD50) of the RPE. In sub-acute toxicity study, the extract was administered by gavage at the doses of 250, 500 and 1000mg\/kg\/day for 21 consecutive days.The antioxidant activity of RPE was investigated through various methods both in vitro and in vivo.\nthe admistrated doses did not produce mortality or changes in general behaviors of the tested males and females mice. The LD50 was found to be superior to 5000mg\/kg DW. Moreover, daily administration of RPE at doses ranged from 500 to 1000mg\/kg could result in alteration of liver and kidney histology. Significant decrease in liver enzymes (ALT and AST), urea and creatinine levels in female plasma was recorded. The RPE was, in vitro, strong in DPPH scavenging and hemolytic inhibition, benificial in lipid peroxidation inhibition and reducing power. In addition, it exhibited, in vivo, a strong effect on GSH leve increasing and lipid peroxidation inhibition in liver and kidney.\nIt can be suggested, based on the results of this study, that the crude extract of Reichardia picroide was non-toxic in acute administration and the use of this extract is safe at doses \u2264 250mg\/kg. This study supports the application of Reichardia picroides in alimentary and traditional medicine purposes. Moreover, antioxidant activity results suggested that Reichardia picroide had potent antioxidant activities and could be utilized as new natural antioxidant in food and therapeutics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f23cf058f610002d8d","authors":["Sana Aouachria","Sabah Boumerfeg","Abderrahim Benslama","Faycel Benbacha","Thoraya Guemmez","Seddik Khennouf","Lekhmici Arrar","Abderrahmane Baghiani"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jep.2017.06.028","first_seen_on":"2017-09-01T08:00:14+00:00","issns":["03788741"],"journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1504252801,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378874117310887"],"pmid":"28663147","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["socialsciences","pharmacology"],"title":"Acute, sub-acute toxicity and antioxidant activities ( in vitro and in vivo ) of Reichardia picroide crude extract","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-subacute-toxicity-antioxidant-activities-vitro-vivo-reichardia-picroide-crude-extract"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":6416998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173726,"mean":12.409383899842,"rank":122937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173726,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2746,"mean":3.9766229508197,"rank":1645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2746,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":0.61388888888889,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PVpapers\/statuses\/903527854583013377","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24602082],"posted_on":"2017-09-01T08:00:01+00:00","author":{"name":"PV Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877169534054039553\/E3fcPByn_normal.jpg","description":"Semi-automated account, tweeting  pharmacovigilance studies, papers and documents.
