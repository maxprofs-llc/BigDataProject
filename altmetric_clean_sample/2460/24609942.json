There is limited data available on the clinical profile and outcome of Influenza A\/H1N1 in this subset of patients.\nA retrospective study was performed of Influenza A\/H1N1 cases diagnosed between January 2015 to December 2015 in the in-patients of Pediatric Oncology unit of a tertiary care hospital from Northern India.\nIn total, 16 children were diagnosed with laboratory confirmed H1N1. Most frequent symptoms were fever and cough. Oseltamivir was administered to all patients. Complications encountered were delay\/interruption of antineoplastic therapy (9), need for respiratory support (5), and air leaks (1). Prolonged viral shedding was encountered in 50% of patients who were retested for H1N1 in their throat swabs. There were 2 deaths, 1 in a child of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia on induction therapy and another in a child with anaplastic Wilms tumor.\nChildhood cancer patients infected with Influenza A\/H1N1 are at risk of serious illness and higher mortality. Delay of anticancer treatment is a concern in these infected children. Prompt initiation of antivirals and an optimum duration of treatment are warranted to reduce the morbidity and mortality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd0","authors":["Nishant Verma","Vishal Pooniya","Archana Kumar"],"doi":"10.1097\/mph.0000000000000962","first_seen_on":"2017-09-01T10:58:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1077-4114","1536-3678"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Hematology \/ Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1504263441,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28859039?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28859039","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology","pediatrics"],"title":"Clinical Profile and Outcome of Influenza A\/H1N1 in Pediatric Oncology Patients During the 2015 Outbreak","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-profile-outcome-influenza-ah1n1-pediatric-oncology-patients-during-2015-outbreak"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":7307414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173734,"mean":12.408822261746,"rank":141929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173734,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":985,"mean":1.1707154471545,"rank":843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.45833333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/903572481549656064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24609942],"posted_on":"2017-09-01T10:57:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"903572481549656064"}]}}
