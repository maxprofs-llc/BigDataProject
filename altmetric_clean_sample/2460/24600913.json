While frustrating for patients, it can also be frustrating for clinicians to treat, as there is no definitive treatment. Dermatologists are very familiar with the use of methotrexate for psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases, and this medication is generally well tolerated in children. This study present a case series reviewing the efficacy of methotrexate in our pediatric patients with alopecia areata, making use of a retrospective chart review design from 2011-2016. In this data set, 8\/14 subjects (57%) experienced good regrowth with methotrexate, while 3\/14 (21%) had a response that could not be assessed due to loss to follow-up or premature discontinuation of the medication. No cases discontinued the medication due to recognized methotrexate side effects. This review suggests methotrexate is a generally safe and often effective medication in pediatric alopecia areata.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fbc","authors":["Erin T. Landis","Rita O.
