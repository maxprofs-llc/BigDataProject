A clear biological framework helps connect and organize animal and human research on stress. In particular, the concepts of \"toxic stress\" and \"allostatic load and overload\" highlight those experiences and situations that, as Kagan says, \"compromise an organism's health and capacity to cope with daily challenges\" (p. 442). A deeper understanding is needed of the epigenetic influences throughout the life course that contribute both to these negative outcomes and to positive ones.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043af","authors":["McEwen, Bruce S","McEwen, Craig A"],"doi":"10.1177\/1745691616646635","endpage":"455","first_seen_on":"2016-07-31T10:01:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1745-6924","1745-6916"],"issue":"4","journal":"Perspectives on Psychological Science (Sage Publications Inc.)","last_mentioned_on":1469965388,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27474133?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27474133?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27474133","pubdate":"2016-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"451","title":"Response to Jerome Kagans Essay on Stress (2016)","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/response-jerome-kagans-essay-stress-2016"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":5914461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1957591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":23},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257480,"mean":11.99155615021,"rank":167420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":74871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257480,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":654,"mean":45.332606431853,"rank":624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":654,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":65.337411764706,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
