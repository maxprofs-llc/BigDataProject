It has been shown that SCA-1(+) progenitor cells are involved in neointimal hyperplasia of vein grafts, but little is known concerning their involvement in hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerosis. We employed single-cell sequencing technology on primary adventitial mouse SCA-1(+) cells from wild-type and atherosclerotic-prone (ApoE-deficient) mice and found that a group of genes controlling cell migration and matrix protein degradation was highly altered. Adventitial progenitors from ApoE-deficient mice displayed an augmented migratory potential both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. This increased migratory ability was mimicked by lipid loading to SCA-1(+) cells. Furthermore, we show that lipid loading increased miRNA-29b expression and induced sirtuin-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels to promote cell migration. These results provide direct evidence that blood cholesterol levels influence vascular progenitor cell function, which could be a potential target cell for treatment of vascular disease.","altmetric_jid":"52d5438d3cf05876028b4567","authors":["Kokkinopoulos, Ioannis","Wong, Mei Mei","Potter, Claire M.F.","Xie, Yao","Yu, Baoqi","Warren, Derek T.","Nowak, Witold N.","Le Bras,
