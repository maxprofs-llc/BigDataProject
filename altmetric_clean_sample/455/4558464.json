Guidelines of when and how to treat are not well-established because CLL is a disease of the elderly and it is important to balance preservation of functional status and control of the disease. Advances in molecular and genetic profiling has led to the ability to identify sub-groups of patients with CLL whose disease may respond to selected therapy. This review discusses current standard therapies in the major sub-groups of CLL based on age and functional status, in both the front-line and relapsed\/refractory settings. It also provides a concise review of novel agents that have shown considerable efficacy in CLL.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["Yu, Eun-Mi","Kittai, Adam","Tabbara, Imad A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-27T10:30:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-7530"],"issue":"10","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1443349834,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26408673?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26408673","pubdate":"2015-09-27T22:00:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: Current Concepts.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-current-concepts-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6409956,"mean":5.8659263866918,"rank":5460617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6409956,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200771,"mean":10.005612402251,"rank":160227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200771,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1572,"mean":2.94888478676,"rank":1051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1572,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":1.2642857142857,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
