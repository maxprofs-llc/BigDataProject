The images of the overlapping Airy discs were analyzed to determine the center of the point spread function after noise reduction using Fourier transformation analysis. The Cartesian coordinates of the centers of the point spread functions were compared in serial images. Histograms constructed from serial images fit well to Gaussian functions for resolving two quantum dots separated by as little as 10nm in the x-y coordinates. Statistical analysis of multiple pairs validated discrimination of inter-fluorophore distances that vary by 10nm. The method is simple and developed for x-y resolution of dilute fluorophores on a flat surface, not serial z sectioning.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5053cf058f6100030d2","authors":["Glasgow, Ben J","Ma, Lie"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.micron.2015.09.007","first_seen_on":"2015-09-27T10:01:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-4291"],"journal":"Micron","last_mentioned_on":1443348099,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26409111?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26409111","pubdate":"2015-09-27T22:00:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Interdisciplinary Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Simultaneous two color image capture for sub-diffraction localization fluorescence microscopy.","type":"article","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simultaneous-two-color-image-capture-subdiffraction-localization-fluorescence-microscopy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6409956,"mean":5.8659263866918,"rank":5460615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6409956,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200771,"mean":10.005622114858,"rank":160227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200771,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157,"mean":1.9938974358974,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.71875,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
