Here, we present a genetic analysis of the chromosomal loci affecting IGC with the data collected from 90 common wheat varieties cultivated in four environments. Statistical analysis showed that IGC was controlled mainly genetically and influenced by the environment. Among the major genetic components known to affect end-use quality, 1BL\/1RS translocation had a significantly negative effect on IGC across all four environments. As to the different alleles of Glu-A1, -B1 and -D1 loci, Glu-A1a, Glu-B1b and Glu-D1d exhibited relatively strong positive effects on IGC in all environments. To identify new loci affecting IGC, association mapping with 1355 DArT markers was conducted. A total of 133 markers were found associated with IGC in two or more environments (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), ten of which consistently affected IGC in all four environments. The phenotypic variance explained by the ten markers varied from 4.66% to 8.03%, and their elite alleles performed significantly better than the inferior counterparts in enhancing IGC. Among the ten markers, wPt-3743 and wPt-733835 reflected the action of Glu-D1, and wPt-664972 probably indicated the effect of Glu-A1. The other seven markers, forming three clusters on 2AL, 3BL or 7BL chromosome arms, represented newly identified genetic determinants of IGC. Our work provided novel insights into the genetic control of IGC, which may facilitate wheat end-use quality improvement through molecular breeding in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c9e","authors":["Jin, Huaibing","Wang, Zhaojun","Li, Da","Wu, Peipei","Dong, Zhengying","Rong, Chaowu","Liu, Xin","Qin, Huanju","Li, Huili","Wang, Daowen","Zhang, Kunpu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jgg.2015.04.010","first_seen_on":"2015-09-27T12:02:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1673-8527"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Genetics and Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1459510989,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26408094?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26408094","pubdate":"2015-09-27T22:00:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Genetic Analysis of Chromosomal Loci Affecting the Content of Insoluble Glutenin in Common Wheat.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-analysis-chromosomal-loci-affecting-content-insoluble-glutenin-common-wheat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":6473611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233762,"mean":9.3560066905942,"rank":194353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233762,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217,"mean":2.1161388888889,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1681818181818,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/wheat_papers\/statuses\/648105337132740608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4558591],"posted_on":"2015-09-27T12:02:08+00:00","author":{"name":"wheatpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570928252454055936\/nyIDp8RF_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"wheat_papers","tweeter_id":"3062846807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":247},"tweet_id":"648105337132740608"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/wheat_papers\/statuses\/715867093103542272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4558591],"posted_on":"2016-04-01T11:43:09+00:00","author":{"name":"wheatpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570928252454055936\/nyIDp8RF_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"wheat_papers","tweeter_id":"3062846807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":247},"tweet_id":"715867093103542272"}]}}
