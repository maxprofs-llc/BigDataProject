Here, chromium-, gold- and nickel-coated mirrors have been adopted in the vacuum ultraviolet and soft X-ray branch beamline BL-13B at the Photon Factory in Tsukuba, Japan. Carbon contamination on the chromium-coated mirror was almost completely removed by exposure to oxygen at a pressure of 8 \u00d7 10(-2)\u2005Pa for 1\u2005h under irradiation of non-monochromated synchrotron radiation. The pressure in the chamber recovered to the order of 10(-7)\u2005Pa within a few hours. The reflectivity of the chromium-coated mirror of the second-order harmonics in the carbon K-edge region (560-660\u2005eV) was found to be a factor of 0.1-0.48 smaller than that of the gold-coated mirror.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f4b","authors":["Toyoshima, A.","Toyoshima, A.","Kikuchi, T.","Tanaka, H.","Mase, K.","Amemiya, K."],"doi":"10.1107\/s1600577515015040","first_seen_on":"2015-09-27T00:02:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-5775"],"issue":"Pt 6","journal":"Journal of Synchrotron Radiation (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1443312003,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S1600577515015040"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/s\/issues\/2015\/06\/00\/mo5125\/mo5125.pdf","pmid":"26524299","pubdate":"2015-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
