Many treatment options are available, and surgery still plays a crucial role. In recent years, many medical societies have provided surgeons and gastroenterologists dealing with CD with authoritative guidelines. However, a certain degree of variation can be observed in these papers, and application of guidelines in clinical practice should be improved. The Italian society of colorectal surgery (SICCR) promoted the project reported here, which consists of a think tank of Italian colorectal surgeons to address the surgical aspects of CD management. Members of the society were invited to express their opinions on several items proposed by the writing committee, based on evidence available in the literature. The results are presented, focusing on relevant points. The present paper is not an alternative to available guidelines; rather, it offers a snapshot of the attitudes of SICCR surgeons about the surgical treatment of CD. The management of CD is, by necessity, patient-tailored, and it is based on clinical data and surgeon's preference, but the committee was able to identify some points of major disagreement and suggested strategies to improve quality of available data and acceptance of guidelines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000361c","authors":["G.
