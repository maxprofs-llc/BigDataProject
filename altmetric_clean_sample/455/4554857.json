However, the roles of other A\u03b2PP cleavage products in disease pathology remain elusive. Here, we measured levels of the major secreted A\u03b2PP processing products sA\u03b2PP\u03b1, sA\u03b2PP\u03b2, and A\u03b2 species in postmortem collected ventricular CSF of 196 AD patients and 74 controls. In AD we identified A\u03b242 to decrease continuously with progressing Braak stages, whereas A\u03b240 was upregulated in early stages of the disease (Braak stage 4) and down-regulated with progressing pathology. Interestingly, both sA\u03b2PP\u03b1 and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 were upregulated in AD as compared to controls (sA\u03b2PP\u03b1, p\u200a=\u200a0.02; sA\u03b2PP\u03b2, p\u200a=\u200a0.01). Moreover, we observed a strong positive correlation of both alternative A\u03b2PP processing products, sA\u03b2PP\u03b1 and sA\u03b2PP\u03b2 (r2=\u200a0.781; p\u200a< \u200a0.0001). Together, our results argue for generally enhanced A\u03b2PP processing in AD patients and emphasize the necessity of analyzing the roles of all A\u03b2PP processing products in AD pathology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Hartl, Daniela","Gu, Wei","Mayhaus, Manuel","Pichler, Sabrina","Sch\u00f6pe, Jakob","Wagenpfeil, Stefan","Riemenschneider, Matthias"],"doi":"10.3233\/jad-150191","first_seen_on":"2015-09-25T22:41:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-8908"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","last_mentioned_on":1468506128,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26401559?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26401559"],"pmid":"26401559","pubdate":"2015-09-26T22:02:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"Amyloid-\u03b2 Protein Precursor Cleavage Products in Postmortem Ventricular Cerebrospinal Fluid of Alzheimer's Disease Patients.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amyloid%CE%B2-protein-precursor-cleavage-products-postmortem-ventricular-cerebrospinal-fluid-alzheimers-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8071125,"mean":6.8533209909723,"rank":804301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7234364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8071125,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237313,"mean":9.4883104857736,"rank":33139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":203392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237313,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2410,"mean":14.905359070154,"rank":594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2410,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":16.129539568345,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Amyloid-\u03b2 Protein Precursor Cleavage Products in Postmortem Ventricular Cerebrospinal Fluid of Alzheimer's Disease Patients.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=22887614528&p=1pl&v=1&x=wyle4EqFO0r0LzIIDrWB3w","license":"public","citation_ids":[4554857],"posted_on":"2015-10-02T23:25:31+00:00","summary":"Hartl D, Gu W, Mayhaus M, Pichler S, Sch\u00f6pe J, Wagenpfeil S, Riemenschneider M.","author":{"name":"Alzforum","url":"http:\/\/www.alzforum.org","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/355\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-04-08_at_12.16.09_1.png?1428491784"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/647541484787396608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4554857],"posted_on":"2015-09-25T22:41:35+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
