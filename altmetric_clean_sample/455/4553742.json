The free text definitions were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis.\nOf the, 200 medical educators invited to participate, 685 (31.1%) provided a definition of a \"medical educator\". The qualitative analysis of the free text definitions revealed that medical educators defined themselves in 13 roles, primarily as \"Professional Expert\", \"Facilitator\", \"Information Provider\", \"Enthusiast\", \"Faculty Developer\", \"Mentor\", \"Undergraduate and Postgraduate Trainer\", \"Curriculum Developer\", \"Assessor and Assessment Creator\", and \"Researcher\".\nOur survey revealed that medical educators predominantly define themselves as \"Professional Experts\" and identified 12 further self-defined roles of a medical educator, several of which not to have been reported previously. The results can be used to further the understanding of our professional identity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041e4","authors":["Nikendei, Christoph","Ben-David, Miriam Friedman","Mennin, Stewart","Huwendiek, S\u00f6ren"],"doi":"10.3109\/0142159x.2015.1073236","first_seen_on":"2015-09-25T15:00:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1466-187X"],"journal":"Medical Teacher","last_mentioned_on":1445926350,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26383184?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/0142159X.2015.1073236"],"pmid":"26383184","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education Systems","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["education"],"title":"Medical educators: How they define themselves - Results of an international web survey.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medical-educators-define-themselves-results-international-web-survey"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6496325,"mean":6.0089414145595,"rank":917096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5576994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6496325,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203052,"mean":10.012363908575,"rank":41148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":161793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203052,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1061,"mean":5.1358075471698,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1061,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":8.2803157894737,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":7,"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
