The important findings in a retrospective review were that laminectomy resulted in a high mortality rate and loss of motor function and that steroids did not improve neural recovery in quadriplegics and their use was associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Closed or open reduction followed by posterior fusion for subluxations or dislocations, and anterior decompression and fusion for vertebral compression fractures, offered the best chance for recovery of neural function and restoration of stability. Massive epidural hemorrhage was found only in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd4","authors":["H H Bohlman","Bohlman, H H"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-25T17:36:43+00:00","issns":["0021-9355","1535-1386"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery, American Volume","last_mentioned_on":1443202585,"links":["http:\/\/jbjs.org\/content\/61\/8\/1119.long","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/511875"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jbjs.org\/content\/jbjsam\/61\/8\/1119.full.pdf","pmid":"511875","pubdate":"1979-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Acute fractures and dislocations of the cervical spine.
