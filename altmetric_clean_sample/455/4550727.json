The clinical characteristics of HLAP and non-HLAP were statistically analyzed.\nThe etiologic ratio of HLAP in acute pancreatitis rose from 13% in 2009 to 25.6% in 2013. Diabetes mellitus, fatty liver, and acute pancreatitis recurrence were positively correlated with HLAP, and female sex, age (>60 years), and alkaline phosphatase level were negatively correlated with HLAP. The diagnostic accuracy of amylase in HLAP was only 40.38%, compared with lipase (91.83%). Different cutoff points of serum triglyceride on day 1 (5.33 mmol\/L), day 2 (2.77 mmol\/L), and day 3 (2.18 mmol\/L) could be used to obtain an accurate diagnosis of HLAP. Higher incidences of acute peripancreatic fluid collection, renal failure, and severe acute pancreatitis were also observed in patients with HLAP.\nDifferent clinical presentations of HLAP should be applied to be distinguished from non-HLAP in the clinic.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008447","authors":["Yin, Guojian","Cang, Xiaofeng","Yu, Ge","Hu, Guoyong","Ni, Jianbo","Xiong, Jie","Hu, Yanling","Xing, Miao","Chen, Congying","Huang, Yinshi","Tang, Maochun","Zhao, Yan","Cheng, Guilian","Wan, Rong","Wang, Shaofeng","Wang, Xingpeng"],"doi":"10.1097\/mpa.0000000000000403","first_seen_on":"2015-09-24T23:55:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-4828","0885-3177"],"issue":"7","journal":"Pancreas","last_mentioned_on":1443138934,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pancreasjournal\/Abstract\/2015\/10000\/Different_Clinical_Presentations_of_Hyperlipidemic.14.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pancreasjournal\/2015\/10000\/Different_Clinical_Presentations_of_Hyperlipidemic.14.pdf","pmid":"26348469","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1105","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Different Clinical Presentations of Hyperlipidemic Acute Pancreatitis: A Retrospective Study","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/different-clinical-presentations-hyperlipidemic-acute-pancreatitis-retrospective-study-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6395994,"mean":5.8563900842303,"rank":5448849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6395994,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200757,"mean":9.8858358205982,"rank":160204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200757,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1586,"mean":1.2659760252366,"rank":1468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1586,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":1.7378640776699,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PANCREASonline\/statuses\/647197714208260096","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4550727],"posted_on":"2015-09-24T23:55:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Pancreas Online","url":"http:\/\/www.pancreasjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1090001998\/pancreascover_normal.jpg","description":"Pancreas is a forum for original works in basic & clinical research on the exocrine & endocrine pancreas, interrelationships & consequences in disease states","id_on_source":"PANCREASonline","tweeter_id":"172035240","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":511},"tweet_id":"647197714208260096"}]}}
