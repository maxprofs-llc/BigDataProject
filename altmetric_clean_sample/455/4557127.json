Design, settings, and main outcome measure: TaqMan Low-Density Arrays were used to profile plasma miRNAs in 6 women with pregestational obesity (PregestOB), 6 with gestational obesity (GestOB) and 6 with normal pregnancies (Control) during the second trimester of gestation. The most relevant miRNAs were validated in 70 pregnant women (20 PregestOB, 25 GestOB and 25 Control). Maternal metabolic parameters including glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, C-peptide and lipids were assessed. Placentas were weighed at delivery and newborns also during 6 months of life.\nWeidentified 13 circulatingmiRNAsdifferentially expressed in maternal obesity, including decreased levels of miR-29c, miR-99b miR-103, miR-221, miR-340, and increased levels of miR-30a- 5p, miR-130a and miR-150 in GestOB; and decreased levels of miR-122, miR-324-3p, miR-375, miR-652 and increased levels of miR-625 in both PregestOB and GestOB (p<0.05 to p<0.0001 vs control). Decreased levels of several of these miRNAs associated with a more adverse maternal metabolic status (more pregnancy weight gain, glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, C-peptide, triacylglycerol and less HDL-cholesterol), with more placental weight, weight at birth and at 6 months of life (all p<0.05 to p<0.001).\nThis study provides the first identification of altered circulating miRNAs in maternal obesity and suggests a possible role of such miRNAS as markers for pre- and post-natal growth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["Carreras-Badosa, Gemma","Bonmat\u00ed, Alexandra","Ortega, Francisco-Jose","Mercader, Josep-Maria","Guindo-Mart\u00ednez, Marta","Torrents, David","Prats-Puig, Anna","Martinez-Calcerrada, Jose-Maria","Platero, Est\u00edbaliz","De Zegher, Francis","Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Lourdes","Fernandez-Real, Jose-Manuel","Lopez-Bermejo, Abel","Bassols, Judit"],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2015-2872","first_seen_on":"2015-09-26T17:40:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-7197"],"journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1455014009,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26406295?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26406295"],"pmid":"26406295","pubdate":"2015-09-26T22:00:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Altered circulating miRNA expression profile in pregestational and gestational obesity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/altered-circulating-mirna-expression-profile-pregestational-gestational-obesity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7156405,"mean":6.3086437613049,"rank":3169164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3826695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7156405,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232624,"mean":9.2828720719791,"rank":98510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":125960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232624,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6174,"mean":7.6355415519197,"rank":3535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6174,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":14.964189189189,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
