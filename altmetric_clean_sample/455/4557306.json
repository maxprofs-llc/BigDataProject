The external stress domains (interpersonal problems, housing, and neighborhood stress) were combined into a Composite Stressor score. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated ex\u00a0vivo and cytokine responses to innate, adaptive, and polyclonal immune stimuli were compared with stress and depression scores for 469 of the 606 study participants.\nThere were no significant positive associations between Composite Stressor scores, perceived stress, or depression scores and proinflammatory or type 2 cytokine responses, and these findings were not modified by allergy or asthma status. There were some modest associations with individual stressors and cytokine responses, but no consistent relations were noted. Depression was associated with decreased responses to some stimuli, particularly dust mite.\nComposite measurements of stressors, perceived stress, or depression were not positively related to proinflammatory or type 2 cytokine responses in these young urban women. These data do not support the hypothesis that these factors promote cytokine responses associated with allergy.\nClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT00114881.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005723","authors":["Gruenberg, David A","Wright, Rosalind J","Visness, Cynthia M","Jaffee, Katy F","Bloomberg, Gordon R","Cruikshank, William W","Kattan, Meyer","Sandel, Megan T","Wood, Robert A","Gern, James E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.anai.2015.07.021","first_seen_on":"2015-09-26T20:25:36+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["10811206","1534-4436","1081-1206"],"journal":"Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1454423729,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1081120615005189&_version=1&md5=6d68c9a714b1ed747509e509f1355ec7","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26409873?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.annallergy.org\/article\/S1081-1206(15)00518-9\/abstract"],"pmid":"26409873","pubdate":"2015-09-28T14:13:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Relation between stress and cytokine responses in inner-city mothers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relation-between-stress-cytokine-responses-innercity-mothers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7292821,"mean":6.3688701243107,"rank":3284922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3844955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7292821,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233009,"mean":9.3123244695461,"rank":99101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":125650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233009,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1559,"mean":8.2035725288832,"rank":1014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1559,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":10.076592592593,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
