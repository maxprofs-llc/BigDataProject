Drawing on sources such as phenomenology, clinical research and experimental psychology, it is proposed that insight is not an 'all-or-none' phenomenon but is composed of three distinct, overlapping dimensions, namely, the recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to relabel unusual mental events (delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. A scheme is proposed to standardise the assessment of insights to assist further research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057a0","authors":["A S David"],"doi":"10.1192\/bjp.156.6.798","first_seen_on":"2015-09-26T09:52:33+00:00","issns":["0007-1250","1472-1465"],"journal":"British Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1443261110,"links":["http:\/\/bjp.rcpsych.org\/content\/156\/6\/798"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjp.rcpsych.org\/content\/bjprcpsych\/156\/6\/798.full.pdf","pmid":"2207510","pubdate":"1990-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal College of Psychiatrists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Insight and psychosis.","type":"article","volume":"156","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insight-psychosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6409956,"mean":5.8659263866918,"rank":4736150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":949400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6409956,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201179,"mean":9.986330851286,"rank":138320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":40628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201179,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3156,"mean":10.22654199683,"rank":2637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3156,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":14.575092592593,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":28,"Student  > Doctoral Student":18,"Student  > Ph.
