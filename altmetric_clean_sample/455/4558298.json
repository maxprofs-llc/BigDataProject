In addition to the heterogeneity of the diseases, the atypical presentation of each disease caused by hypomorphic mutations or somatic mosaicism makes genetic diagnosis challenging. Next-generation sequencing tests all genes simultaneously and has proven its innovative efficacy in genomics. We describe a male PID patient without any family history of immunodeficiency. This patient suffered from recurrent infections from 1\u00a0year of age. Laboratory analysis showed hypogammaglobulinemia. T, B, and NK cells were present, but the T cell proliferative response decreased. Whole-exome sequencing analysis identified an IL2RG p.P58T missense mutation. CD8(+) and CD56(+) cells showed revertant somatic mosaicism to the wild-type allele. A late-onset and atypical presentation of the X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) phenotype might be associated with revertant somatic mosaicism in T and NK cells. This patient is the seventh reported case of X-SCID with revertant somatic mosaicism. His classical clinical management did not result in a molecular diagnosis because of the atypical presentation. The coverage that is provided by whole-exome sequencing of most PID genes effectively excluded differential diagnoses other than X-SCID. As next-generation sequencing becomes available in clinical practice, it will enhance our knowledge of PID and rescue currently undiagnosed patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cfe","authors":["Okuno, Yusuke","Hoshino, Akihiro","Muramatsu, Hideki","Kawashima, Nozomu","Wang, Xinan","Yoshida, Kenichi","Wada, Taizo","Gunji, Masaharu","Toma, Tomoko","Kato, Tamaki","Shiraishi, Yuichi","Iwata, Atsuko","Hori, Toshinori","Kitoh, Toshiyuki","Chiba, Kenichi","Tanaka, Hiroko","Sanada, Masashi","Takahashi, Yoshiyuki","Nonoyama, Shigeaki","Ito, Masafumi","Miyano, Satoru","Ogawa, Seishi","Kojima, Seiji","Kanegane, Hirokazu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10875-015-0202-0","first_seen_on":"2015-09-27T10:10:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-2592"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1471350789,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26407811?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26407811?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26407811","pubdate":"2015-09-27T22:00:38+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Late-Onset Combined Immunodeficiency with a Novel IL2RG Mutation and Probable Revertant Somatic Mosaicism.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lateonset-combined-immunodeficiency-novel-il2rg-mutation-probable-revertant-somatic-mosaicism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":3772719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4368717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238088,"mean":9.5768682120402,"rank":96880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":136885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238088,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":584,"mean":6.0348473413379,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":584,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.2684210526316,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":5,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Immunology and Microbiology":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":6,"Mathematics":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"CA":1,"CZ":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/statuses\/648077238643068928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4558298],"posted_on":"2015-09-27T10:10:29+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":228},"tweet_id":"648077238643068928"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Exome_seq\/statuses\/648079146275332096","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4558298],"posted_on":"2015-09-27T10:18:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Exome-seq","url":"http:\/\/genomics.cruk.cam.ac.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/520305836476755970\/1oHrqeyl_normal.png","description":"A PubMed RSS feed for exome, by dlvr.it, http:\/\/bit.ly\/1qv7gmS, and @CIgenomics","id_on_source":"Exome_seq","tweeter_id":"2820127624","geo":{"lt":52.2,"ln":0.11667,"country":"GB"},"followers":628},"tweet_id":"648079146275332096"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IL7Papers\/statuses\/765526810582880256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4558298],"posted_on":"2016-08-16T12:33:09+00:00","author":{"name":"IL7Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"IL7Papers","tweeter_id":"4010117872","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":8},"tweet_id":"765526810582880256"}]}}
