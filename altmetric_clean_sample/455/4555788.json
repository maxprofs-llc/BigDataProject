Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) and Complex Regional Pain syndrome (CRPS) remain the strongest indications. Funding remains a difficult issue and the use of trial of stimulation is the traditional method of ensuring best outcomes from implantation.\nA retrospective and consecutive review of 80 cases of spinal cord stimulation for patients with a diagnosis of FBSS and CRPS having undergone prior comprehensive medical management and interventional treatment with no sustained benefit. Trial of stimulation was performed on-table and if acceptable coverage was achieved, the case proceeded to full implantation.\nThe mean patient age was 50.08 years (range 28-80 years). At 12 months follow-up, thirty two patients (40%) no longer required analgesic medication. Thirty patients (37.5%) reported their pain was manageable with first line analgesics. Fourteen (17.5%) reported their pain was manageable first line analgesic and occasional tramadol or codeine. Four (5%) reported that their pain was manageable with NSAID's, paracetamol, amitriptyline, and regular codeine or tramadol. Seventeen out of eighty patients (21.25%) were unemployed before SCS implant, and at 12 months follow up eight of these patients (47.05%) had returned to work. There was no infective complications or explants. Two patients (2.53%) required one lead revision, which was successful.\nSCS is the most effective treatment for FBSS and CRPS, which is proven resistant to medical management. On-table trial and implantation is easy to perform with good success rate and low morbidity and if successful will reduce complication rates, especially infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb9","authors":["Gopal, Hari","Fitzgerald, Joseph","McCrory,
