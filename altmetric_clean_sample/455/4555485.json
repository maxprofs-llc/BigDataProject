Cyst aspiration revealed negatively birefringent crystals, which were consistent with gout.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005d2d","authors":["Derry, William","Motamedi, Kambiz","Ben-Artzi, Ami"],"doi":"10.1097\/ruq.0000000000000130","first_seen_on":"2015-09-26T06:32:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-0253","0894-8771"],"issue":"3","journal":"Ultrasound quarterly","last_mentioned_on":1443316466,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ultrasound-quarterly\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/Floating_Tophi_in_a_Baker_Cyst_Secondary_to_Gout_.9.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ultrasound-quarterly\/2015\/09000\/Floating_Tophi_in_a_Baker_Cyst_Secondary_to_Gout_.9.pdf","pmid":"26366691","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"189","subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Floating Tophi in a Baker Cyst Secondary to Gout: Ultrasound Features and Differential Diagnosis","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/floating-tophi-baker-cyst-secondary-gout"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6409956,"mean":5.8659263866918,"rank":4736151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":949401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6409956,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201178,"mean":9.9863839703347,"rank":138320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":40628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201178,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":649,"mean":0.83496913580247,"rank":392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":649,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.88620689655172,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UltrasoundQtrly\/statuses\/647660049351839744","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4555485],"posted_on":"2015-09-26T06:32:43+00:00","author":{"name":"UltrasoundQtrly","url":"http:\/\/www.ultrasound-quarterly.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1588396088\/UQ_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Ultrasound Quarterly covers the newest, most sophisticated ultrasound techniques as well as in-depth analysis of important developments in this dynamic field.","id_on_source":"UltrasoundQtrly","tweeter_id":"390964536","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":600},"tweet_id":"647660049351839744"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UltrasoundQtrly\/statuses\/647942337583144960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4555485],"posted_on":"2015-09-27T01:14:26+00:00","author":{"name":"UltrasoundQtrly","url":"http:\/\/www.ultrasound-quarterly.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1588396088\/UQ_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Ultrasound Quarterly covers the newest, most sophisticated ultrasound techniques as well as in-depth analysis of important developments in this dynamic field.","id_on_source":"UltrasoundQtrly","tweeter_id":"390964536","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":600},"tweet_id":"647942337583144960"}]}}
