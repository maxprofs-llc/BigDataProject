Recent reports suggest these nutriceuticals may delay age-related diseases and the occurrence of cancer, and reduce mortality in apparently healthy ageing men. Food supplementation with a nutriceutical that was formulated particularly for ageing men should result in an increase of at least one quality-adjusted life year and may lower the financial and social burden of disease in elderly people.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b2c","authors":["Comhaire, F.","Mahmoud, A.","Comhaire, F","Mahmoud, A","F.
