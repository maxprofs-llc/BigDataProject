In OM rats consuming a HFD, an increase in HFD intake, body mass, and percent fat mass, and a HFD-induced decrease in metabolic rate and energy expenditure were demonstrated. In S5B rats consuming a HFD, no change in percent body fat or HFD intake was demonstrated and HFD increased metabolic rate and energy expenditure. To assess whether HFD differentially altered skeletal muscle markers of metabolism in OM and S5B rats, the expression of the transporters, CD36 and GLUT4, and the energy sensors, AMPK and PPAR\u03b3, in the gastrocnemius muscle was measured. Oxidation and lipid accumulation in the gastrocnemius muscle was histologically determined. Consumption of a HFD decreased phosphorylated AMPK and PPAR\u03b3 expression in the skeletal muscle of obesity-prone OM rats. Lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle was significantly higher in OM rats fed a HFD. Overall, these data suggest that the differential response to HFD on metabolic rate, energy expenditure, and phosphorylated AMPK and PPAR\u03b3 in OM and S5B rats, may partially account for differences in the susceptibility to develop obesity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000db0","authors":["Mr. Timothy Allerton"],"doi":"10.1139\/cjpp-2015-0141","first_seen_on":"2015-09-26T05:32:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0008-4212","1205-7541"],"journal":"Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1441051356,"links":["http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/10.1139\/cjpp-2015-0141#.VeSyRiVVhBc"],"pmid":"26641537","pubdate":"2015-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"150814143727002","subjects":["physiology","pharmacology"],"title":"High fat diet differentially regulates metabolic parameters in obesity-resistant S5B\/Pl rats and obesity-prone Osborne-Mendel rats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highfat-diet-differentially-regulates-metabolic-parameters-obesityresistant-s5bpl-rats-obesityprone"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4794677,"mean":3.0402378650473e+18,"rank":4794675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4794677,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168925,"mean":3.0037964623073e+18,"rank":168925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168925,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":3.4932443975557e+18,"rank":415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.452196764364e+18,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
