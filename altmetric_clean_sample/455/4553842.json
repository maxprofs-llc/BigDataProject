In this study modified methods of T.\u00a0gondii oocyst recovery and DNA extraction were applied to 1427 samples collected from 147 public water supplies throughout Scotland. T.\u00a0gondii DNA was detected, using real time PCR (qPCR) targeting the 529bp repeat element, in 8.79% of interpretable samples (124 out of 1411 samples). The samples which were positive for T.\u00a0gondii DNA originated from a third of the sampled water sources. The samples which were positive by qPCR and some of the negative samples were reanalysed using ITS1 nested PCR (nPCR) and results compared. The 529bp qPCR was the more sensitive technique and a full analysis of assay performance, by Bayesian analysis using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, was completed which demonstrated the efficacy of this method for the detection of T.\u00a0gondii in water samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003717","authors":["Beth Wells","Hannah Shaw","Giles Innocent","Stefano Guido","Emily Hotchkiss","Maria Parigi","Marieke Opsteegh","James Green","Simon Gillespie","Elisabeth A.
