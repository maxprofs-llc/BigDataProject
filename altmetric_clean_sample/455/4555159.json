Sept JPGN"],"citation":{"abstract":"To assess the safety and efficacy of endoscopic incision (EI) for the treatment of refractory anastomotic esophageal strictures in pediatric patients.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of pediatric patients with refractory anastomotic strictures after surgical repair of esophageal atresia who underwent at least three sessions of endoscopic treatments (dilation and\/or stenting). They were treated with EI alone or together with esophageal stenting. Efficacy and safety were evaluated during periodical follow-up.\nAll the seven children received the procedure successfully with the operation time of 15 - 60 minutes. Four of them received EI alone, while the other three received endoscopic incision with esophageal stenting (EIES). The symptoms remitted in all the cases, and dysphagia score decreased from 3-4 to 0-1 during follow-up from 1 to 21 months. The average diameter of stricture was enlarged from 3\u200amm (range, 2 mm-5\u200amm) to 10.6\u200amm (range, 8 mm-12\u200amm). One patient suffered from chest pain, which resolved within 3 days. Case 1 had recurrence 11 months after EIES and Case 6 had recurrence 3 months after EI. They all underwent an additional EI to maintain patency. No severe complications were observed during operation and periodical follow-up.\nEndoscopic incision is safe and appears effective for refractory esophageal anastomotic strictures in children in the short term. Large comparative studies are warranted to further confirm our findings. The long-term follow-up is necessary for assessing the long-term efficacy of the new technique.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dcf","authors":["Tan, Yuyong","Zhang, Jie","Zhou, Junfeng","Duan,
