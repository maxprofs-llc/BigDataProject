Here, we report that the RIPK3 expression level is negatively regulated by CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein; also known as STUB1) E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitylation. Chip(-\/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts and CHIP-depleted L929 and HT-29 cells exhibited higher levels of RIPK3 expression, resulting in increased sensitivity to necroptosis induced by TNF (also known as TNF\u03b1). These phenomena are due to the CHIP-mediated ubiquitylation of RIPK3, which leads to its lysosomal degradation. Interestingly, RIPK1 expression is also negatively regulated by CHIP-mediated ubiquitylation, validating the major role of CHIP in necrosome formation and sensitivity to TNF-mediated necroptosis. Chip(-\/-) mice (C57BL\/6) exhibit inflammation in the thymus and massive cell death and disintegration in the small intestinal tract, and die within a few weeks after birth. These phenotypes are rescued by crossing with Ripk3(-\/-) mice. These results imply that CHIP is a bona fide negative regulator of the RIPK1-RIPK3 necrosome formation leading to desensitization of TNF-mediated necroptosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","authors":["Jinho Seo","Eun-Woo Lee","Hyerim Sung","Daehyeon Seong","Yves Dondelinger","Jihye Shin","Manhyung Jeong","Hae-Kyung Lee","Jung-Hoon Kim","Su Yeon Han","Cheolju Lee","Je Kyung Seong","Peter Vandenabeele","Jaewhan Song","Seo, Jinho","Lee, Eun-Woo","Sung, Hyerim","Seong, Daehyeon","Dondelinger, Yves","Shin, Jihye","Jeong, Manhyung","Lee, Hae-Kyung","Kim, Jung-Hoon","Han, Su Yeon","Lee, Cheolju","Seong, Je Kyung","Vandenabeele, Peter","Song, Jaewhan"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncb3314","endpage":"302","first_seen_on":"2016-02-22T17:17:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"1854\/LU-7162756","handles":["1854\/LU-7162756"],"issns":["1465-7392","1476-4679"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nature Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1460505600,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncb\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ncb3314.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ncb3314","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/ncb3314"],"pmid":"26900751","pubdate":"2016-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cell death","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Ubiquitylation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Necroptosis","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"291","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"CHIP controls necroptosis through ubiquitylation- and lysosome-dependent degradation of RIPK3","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chip-controls-necroptosis-through-ubiquitylation-lysosomedependent-degradation-ripk3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":2946550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4539626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286170,"mean":10.480484210379,"rank":102058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":181463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286170,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2377,"mean":9.9548215488215,"rank":1375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2377,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":16.234210526316,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
