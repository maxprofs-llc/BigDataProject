Protein cages offer significant potential for templated synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles. In this study, we successfully synthesized ultrasmall copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles inside the cavity of ferritin (Fn) nanocages by a biomimetic synthesis method. The uniform CuS-Fn nanocages (CuS-Fn NCs) showed strong near-infrared absorbance and high photothermal conversion efficiency. In quantitative ratiometric photoacoustic imaging (PAI), the CuS-Fn NCs exhibited superior photoacoustic tomography improvements for real-time in vivo PAI of entire tumors. With the incorporation of radionuclide 64Cu, 64CuS-Fn NCs also served as an excellent PET imaging agent with higher tumor accumulation compared to free copper. Following the guidance of PAI and PET, CuS-Fn NCs were applied in photothermal therapy to achieve superior cancer therapeutic efficiency with good biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrate that the bioinspired multi-functional CuS-Fn NCs have potential as clinically translatable cancer theranostics and could provide a noninvasive, highly sensitive, and quantitative in vivo guiding method for cancer photothermal therapies in experimental and clinical settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Zhantong Wang"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.5b07521","first_seen_on":"2016-02-22T16:59:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-086X"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1456344915,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsnano.5b07521"],"pmid":"26871955","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Biomineralization-Inspired Synthesis of Copper Sulfide\u2013Ferritin Nanocages as Cancer Theranostics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomineralizationinspired-synthesis-copper-sulfideferritin-nanocages-cancer-theranostics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7269211,"mean":6.3660833867746,"rank":1729065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4602057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7269211,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284356,"mean":10.396290460867,"rank":88073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":190690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284356,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4569,"mean":11.09203765324,"rank":2010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4569,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212,"mean":15.492360189573,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
