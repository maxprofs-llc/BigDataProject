Several highly valuable processes have been developed based on this simplest alkyne and the development of acetylene chemistry has had a paramount impact on chemical science over the last few decades. However, in spite of numerous useful possible reactions, the application of gaseous acetylene in everyday research practice is rather limited. Moreover, the practical implementation of high-pressure acetylene chemistry can be very challenging, owing to the risk of explosion and the requirement for complex equipment; special safety precautions need to be taken to store and handle acetylene under high pressure, which limit its routine use in a standard laboratory setup. Amazingly, recent studies have revealed that calcium carbide, CaC2 , can be used as an easy-to-handle and efficient source of acetylene for in situ chemical transformations. Thus, calcium carbide is a stable and inexpensive acetylene precursor that is available on the ton scale and it can be handled with standard laboratory equipment. The application of calcium carbide in organic synthesis will bring a new dimension to the powerful acetylene chemistry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Rodygin, Konstantin S.","Werner, Georg","Kucherov, Fedor A.","Ananikov, Valentine P."],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201501323","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-02-22T14:07:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1861-471X"],"issue":"7","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1456187780,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/asia.201501323","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201501323?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201501323\/pdf","pmid":"26898248","pubdate":"2016-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Calcium Carbide: A Unique Reagent for Organic Synthesis and Nanotechnology","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calcium-carbide-unique-reagent-organic-synthesis-nanotechnology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7252957,"mean":6.3649994636635,"rank":5467770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7252957,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284308,"mean":10.391915028472,"rank":199202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":45401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284308,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2173,"mean":1.3738379373849,"rank":858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2173,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":1.3025641025641,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
