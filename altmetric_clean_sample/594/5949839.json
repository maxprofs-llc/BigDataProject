Factors within the simulation include rate of change of phase within individual speckle transitions, low-pass filtering to match the frequency range of experimental data with which comparison is to be made, a track-and-hold facility for periods of low signal amplitude, and wavefront curvature effects. The simulation data provide real insight into the phase and amplitude modulation of the Doppler signal, and good agreement is found in the final comparison with experimental data from a measurement on a rotating target.","ads_id":"2006ApOpt..45.4523R","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5693cf058f610004b13","authors":["Rothberg, Steve","Steve Rothberg"],"doi":"10.1364\/ao.45.004523","first_seen_on":"2016-02-22T18:38:53+00:00","issns":["0003-6935","1539-4522"],"issue":"19","journal":"Applied Optics","last_mentioned_on":1467207674,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1364\/ao.45.004523"],"pmid":"16799660","pubdate":"2006-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"4523","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Numerical simulation of speckle noise in laser vibrometry.","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.osapublishing.org\/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-45-19-4523","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/numerical-simulation-speckle-noise-laser-vibrometry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":1967920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4905199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288943,"mean":10.58746018232,"rank":90564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":192045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288943,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":875,"mean":5.7505194508009,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":875,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":9.9638888888889,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
