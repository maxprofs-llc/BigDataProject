Ocean warming or circulation alterations induced by climate change has the potential to slowdown the rate of acidification of ocean waters by decreasing the amount of CO2 uptake by the ocean. However, a recent study showed that climate change affected the decrease in pH insignificantly. Here, we examine the sensitivity of future oceanic acidification to climate change feedbacks within a coupled atmosphere-ocean model and find that ocean warming dominates the climate change feedbacks.\nOur results show that the direct decrease in pH due to ocean warming is approximately equal to but opposite in magnitude to the indirect increase in pH associated with ocean warming (ie reduced DIC concentration of the upper ocean caused by lower solubility of CO2).\nAs climate change feedbacks on pH approximately cancel, future oceanic acidification will closely follow future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This suggests the only way to slowdown or mitigate the potential biological consequences of future ocean acidification is to significantly reduce fossil-fuel emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ed","authors":["Ben I McNeil","Richard J Matear"],"doi":"10.1186\/1750-0680-1-2","first_seen_on":"2016-02-22T17:25:05+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["17500680","1750-0680"],"issue":"1","journal":"Carbon Balance and Management","last_mentioned_on":1495824840,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16930458"],"pmcid":"PMC1513135","pmid":"16930458","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecosystems","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Management","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Forestry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Earth and Planetary Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2","title":"Projected climate change impact on oceanic acidification.","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/projected-climate-change-impact-oceanic-acidification-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":5,"6m":5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":1639210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6597091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290476,"mean":10.747076491952,"rank":71469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":218319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290476,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":8.6514700854701,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":5.7666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
