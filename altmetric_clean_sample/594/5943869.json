Typically, these 'cryptic' epitopes are highly conserved, suggesting an important role in the life of the organism. In contrast, immunodominant epitopes are easily recognized and immune pressure can lead to selection of multiple variants, rendering such epitopes of limited use in vaccine design. Here, we describe a number of examples of cryptic epitopes for antibodies and note their progression in vaccine development. We present current strategies to identify these under-utilized but powerful vaccine determinants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073db","authors":["Good, Michael F","Yanow, Stephanie K","Michael F.
