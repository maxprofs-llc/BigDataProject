Proinflammatory (not so sweet though) bacteria abundant"],"citation":{"abstract":"Intestinal dysbiosis and metabolic endotoxemia have been associated with metabolic disorders, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The main goal of the present study was to evaluate the intestinal dysbiosis in Brazilian T2D patients and correlate these data with inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) plasma concentrations. This study was approved by the Ethics Committees from Barretos Cancer Hospital and all individuals signed the informed consent form. Stool samples were required for DNA extraction, and the V3\/V4 regions of bacterial 16S were sequenced using an Illumina platform. Peripheral blood was used to quantify inflammatory cytokines and plasma LPS concentrations, by CBA flex and ELISA, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney and Spearman's tests. Analysis of variance, diversity indexes, and analysis of alpha- and beta-diversity were conducted using an annotated Operational Taxonomic Unit table. This study included 20 patients and 22 controls. We observed significant differences (P\u2009<\u20090.01) in the microbiota composition (beta-diversity) between patients and controls, suggesting intestinal dysbiosis in Brazilian T2D patients. The prevalent species found in patients' feces were the Gram-negatives Prevotella copri, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides rodentium, and Bacteroides xylanisolvens. The proinflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in patients' plasma and LPS levels were decreased. We find correlations between the proinflammatory interferon-gamma with Gram-negatives Bacteroides and Prevotella species, and a positive correlation between the LPS levels and P. copri reads. The P. copri and B. vulgatus species were associated with insulin resistance in previous studies. In this study, we suggested that the prevalence of Gram-negative species in the gut and the increased plasma IL-6 in patients could be linked to low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. In conclusion, the P. copri and B. vulgatus species could represent an intestinal microbiota signature, associated with T2D development. Furthermore, the identification of these Gram-negative bacteria, and the detection of inflammatory markers, such as increased IL-6, could be used as diabetes predictive markers in overweight, obese and in genetically predisposed individuals to develop T2D.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Leite, Aline Zazeri","Rodrigues, Nath\u00e1lia de Campos","Gonzaga, Marina Ign\u00e1cio","Paiolo, Jo\u00e3o Carlos Cicogna","de Souza, Carolina Arantes","Stefanutto, Nadine Aparecida Vicentini","Omori, Wellington Pine","Pinheiro, Daniel Guariz","Brisotti, Jo\u00e3o Luiz","Matheucci Junior, Euclides","Mariano, V\u00e2nia Sammartino","De Oliveira, Gislane Lelis Vilela","de Oliveira, Gislane Lelis Vilela","Aline Zazeri Leite","Nath\u00e1lia de Campos Rodrigues","Marina Ign\u00e1cio Gonzaga","Jo\u00e3o Carlos Cicogna Paiolo","Carolina Arantes de Souza","Nadine Aparecida Vicentini Stefanutto","Wellington Pine Omori","Daniel Guariz Pinheiro","Jo\u00e3o Luiz Brisotti","Euclides Matheucci Junior","V\u00e2nia Sammartino Mariano","Gislane Lelis Vilela de Oliveira"],"doi":"10.3389\/fimmu.2017.01107","first_seen_on":"2017-09-02T19:12:59+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1664-3224"],"journal":"Frontiers in immunology","last_mentioned_on":1507032406,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fimmu.2017.01107\/abstract","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fimmu.2017.01107\/abstract?utm_content=buffer419a6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fimmu.2017.01107\/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Immunology&id=273121","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3389\/fimmu.2017.01107","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28966614?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5605568","pmid":"28966614","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Detection of increased plasma IL-6 levels and prevalence of Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus in the feces of type 2 diabetes patients","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-increased-plasma-il6-levels-prevalence-prevotella-copri-bacteroides-vulgatus-feces-type-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":2.75,"1w":0.75,"6d":0.75,"5d":0.75,"4d":0.75,"3d":0.75,"2d":0.75,"1d":0.75,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8464649,"mean":7.1091103438598,"rank":2178275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5133375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8464649,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175753,"mean":12.315344951978,"rank":55584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":119033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175753,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3773,"mean":3.1122534464475,"rank":891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3773,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":3.1192413793103,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
