Disparities in risk and prevalence of T2DM are evident in Hispanic youth when compared with non-Hispanic whites. Targeted diabetes prevention programs have been recommended to reduce risk prior to adulthood in this population. This systematic review explores the effectiveness of lifestyle-based diabetes prevention interventions for Hispanic youth.\nPubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CENTRAL were searched from database inception to March 1, 2017, for studies that evaluated lifestyle-focused prevention trials targeting U.S. Hispanic youth under age 18 years. Fifteen publications met criteria for inclusion.\nOf the 15 studies, 11 were RCTs; four were uncontrolled. Interventions were heterogeneous in intensity, content, and setting. Duration of most trials was 12-16 weeks. Mean age of participants ranged from 9.8 to 15.8 years, sample sizes were generally small, and the majority of participants were overweight (BMI \u226585th percentile). Three studies reported statistically significant reductions in mean BMI, four in BMI z-score, and six in fasting glucose\/insulin. Study quality was moderate to high. Effect sizes were generally small to medium.\nEvidence for the impact of lifestyle-based diabetes prevention interventions targeting U.S. Hispanic youth remains limited. Few interventions demonstrated success in reducing BMI and glucose regulation and follow-up times were brief. More studies are needed that recruit larger samples sizes, extend follow-up times, explore innovative delivery modalities, and examine effectiveness across sex and age.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002215","authors":["McCurley, Jessica L.","Crawford, Margaret A.","Gallo, Linda C."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amepre.2017.05.020","first_seen_on":"2017-07-10T10:06:49+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"handles":[],"issns":["0749-3797","1873-2607","07493797"],"journal":"American Journal of Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1499719200,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28688727?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ajpmonline.org\/article\/S0749-3797(17)30291-X\/fulltext?rss=yes"],"pmid":"28688727","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in U.S. Hispanic Youth: A Systematic Review of Lifestyle Interventions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevention-type-2-diabetes-hispanic-youth-systematic-review-lifestyle-interventions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.33,"score_history":{"1y":7.33,"6m":7.33,"3m":7.33,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187776,"mean":6.9233436649085,"rank":1146067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":7038833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187776,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177438,"mean":11.326115004199,"rank":33912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":143374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177438,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2671,"mean":22.918791011236,"rank":1014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2671,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":37.905128205128,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ieiDM2\/statuses\/884353143424798722","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21712562],"posted_on":"2017-07-10T10:06:34+00:00","author":{"name":"IeI Diabetes","url":"http:\/\/acmi.org.co","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793691475020308481\/OeUSIgeX_normal.jpg","description":"Investigaci\u00f3n, emprendimiento e innovaci\u00f3n en diabetes mellitus tipo 2","id_on_source":"ieiDM2","tweeter_id":"793687529090347008","geo":{"lt":6.25184,"ln":-75.56359,"country":"CO"},"followers":28},"tweet_id":"884353143424798722"}],"blogs":[{"title":"Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in U.S. Hispanic Youth: A Systematic Review of Lifestyle Interventions","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/2017\/journal-article-abstracts\/prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-in-u-s-hispanic-youth-a-systematic-review-of-lifestyle-interventions\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[21712562],"posted_on":"2017-07-10T20:40:00+00:00","summary":"&hellip;\nFrom&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;\nPrevention of Type 2 Diabetes in U.S. Hispanic Youth: A Systematic Review of Lifestyle Interventions\nThe post Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in U.S. Hispanic Youth: A Systematic Review of Lifestyle Interventions was curated","author":{"name":"information for practice","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/","description":"news, new scholarship &amp; more from around the world"}}]}}
