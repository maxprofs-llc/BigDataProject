We herein report that the diurnal variation of evoked synaptic responses of cortical neurons disappeared in cathepsin S-deficient (CatS(-\/-)) mice. The dendritic spine density of the cortical neurons was significantly reduced by incubation with a recombinant CatS. Furthermore, CatS(-\/-) mice exhibited impaired social interaction and social novelty recognition in the three-chamber test. These findings indicate that the circadian clock-regulated secretion of CatS from microglia is involved in the diurnal variation of synaptic responses and dendritic spine density through the proteolytic modification of perisynaptic ECM molecules. Therefore, a dysfunction of the diurnal synaptic responses due to CatS deficiency may lead to social behavior abnormalities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Takayama, Fumiko","Zhang, Xinwen","Hayashi, Yoshinori","Wu, Zhou","Nakanishi, Hiroshi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2017.06.061","first_seen_on":"2017-06-18T10:34:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0006-291X","1090-2104","0006291X"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1498219817,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28623134?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS0006291X17311932"],"pmid":"28623134","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Dysfunction in diurnal synaptic responses and social behavior abnormalities in cathepsin S-deficient mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dysfunction-diurnal-synaptic-responses-social-behavior-abnormalities-cathepsin-sdeficient-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":4247940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3949482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239329,"mean":12.885896234456,"rank":121597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":107707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239329,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8830,"mean":2.731556008608,"rank":5576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":3059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8830,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":1.0767326732673,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
