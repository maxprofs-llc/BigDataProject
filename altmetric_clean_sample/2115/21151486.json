In this study, we attempted to obtain a colistin-resistant mutant from an arnB-deleted mutant through exposure to colistin.\nWe constructed an arnB deletion mutant (P5\u0394arnB\u200a::\u200anptIII) from a colistin-susceptible strain (P5) by allelic replacement mutagenesis, and colistin-resistant mutants were selected in vitro using P5 and P5\u0394arnB\u200a::\u200anptIII. The growth rate, lipid A structure, biofilm-forming activity and cell viability in diverse stressful conditions (osmotic, oxidative, acidic and heat stress) were investigated. Expression of phoP, pmrA, parR, and cprR was evaluated by qRT-PCR.\nAn arnB deletion mutant was shown to develop colistin resistance through the addition of l-Ara4N to lipid A, despite a low survival rate (over 1000-fold lower than that of the wild-type strain) in the media with colistin. Two colistin-resistant mutants showed higher survival rates than colistin-susceptible strains against 5\u200a% NaCl. In the presence of acidic and heat stress, P5\u0394arnB\u200a::\u200anptIII-CstR exhibited higher survival rates during conditions of 1\u200a% HCl and 42\u2009\u00b0C than the other strains. Both phoP and pmrA genes were overexpressed significantly in both colistin-resistant mutants, but parR and cprR genes were not.\nWe revealed that colistin resistance could be developed despite arnB deletion in P. aeruginosa through the addition of l-Ara4N to lipid A, which was accompanied by diverse physiological changes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d51","authors":["Chung, Eun Seon","Lee, Ji-Young","Rhee, Ji-Young","Ko, Kwan Soo"],"doi":"10.1099\/jmm.0.000456","first_seen_on":"2017-06-18T10:29:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0022-2615","1473-5644"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1497781776,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28621641?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28621641","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Microbiology Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Colistin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that is not linked to arnB","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/colistin-resistance-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-not-linked-arnb"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":7251778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237872,"mean":12.856728958133,"rank":194431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237872,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1054,"mean":2.8084026590693,"rank":856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1054,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.4822222222222,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/biofilmPapers\/statuses\/876386405819142144","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21151486],"posted_on":"2017-06-18T10:29:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Biofilm Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585213267288653824\/evf5BSKg_normal.jpg","description":"Stay on top of all the latest publications on Biofilm research curated from PubMed. #biofilm #microbiology #antibioticresistance.
