Response rate 84.7%).\nApproximately 4.3% of participants had used EC only, 4.5% had used CC only, and around 5.5% were dual users. Non-users had the lowest prevalence of all nine forms of substance use assessed in the study (i.e., chewing tobacco, any alcohol, drunkenness, marijuana, sniffing, prescription drugs, hallucinogens, synthetic marijuana, and bath salts), followed by EC and CC users. Dual users had the highest prevalence of 8 of 9 forms of substance use. Multinomial logistic regression models showed that EC-only users had significantly greater odds over non-users of using eight of nine types of substances included in the study. Conversely, EC-only users had significantly lower odds of using seven of nine types of substances when compared with dual users. However, EC-only users did not differ from CC-only users, in odds of use in any of the nine substances included in this analysis.\nAmong middle school-aged adolescents, EC-only users do not differ from CC-only users in odds for other forms of substance use. Primary prevention programs should consider EC use initiation as a pathway to greater risk of other licit and illicit substances among young adolescents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cb3cf058f6100003a1","authors":["Kristjansson, Alfgeir L.","Mann, Michael J.","Smith, Megan L.","Alfgeir L.
