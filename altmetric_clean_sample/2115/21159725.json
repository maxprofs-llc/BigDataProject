The elevated prevalence of obesity is mostly due to inadequate diet and lifestyle, but it is also influenced by genetic factors.\nTo review recent advances in the field of the genetics of obesity. We summarize the list of genes associated with the rare non-syndromic forms of obesity, and explain their function. Furthermore, we discuss the technologies that are available for the genetic diagnosis of obesity.\nSeveral studies reported that single gene variants cause Mendelian forms of obesity, determined by mutations of major effect in single genes. Rare, non-syndromic forms of obesity are a result of loss-of-function mutations in genes that act on the development and function of the hypothalamus or the leptin-melanocortin pathway. These variants disrupt enzymes and receptors that play a role in energy homeostasis, resulting in severe early-onset obesity and endocrine dysfunctions. Different approaches and technologies have been used to understand the genetic background of obesity. Currently, whole genome and whole exome sequencing are important diagnostic tools to identify new genes and variants associated with severe obesity, but other approaches are also useful at individual or population levels, such as linkage analysis, candidate gene sequencing, chromosomal microarray analysis, and genome-wide association studies.\nThe understanding of the genetic causes of obesity and the usefulness and limitations of the genetic diagnostic approaches can contribute to the development of new personalized therapeutic targets against obesity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d53","authors":["Ana Carolina Proen\u00e7a da Fonseca","Claudio Mastronardi","Angad Johar","Mauricio Arcos-Burgos","Gilberto Paz-Filho","da Fonseca, Ana Carolina Proen\u00e7a","Mastronardi, Claudio","Johar, Angad","Arcos-Burgos, Mauricio","Paz-Filho, Gilberto"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jdiacomp.2017.04.026","first_seen_on":"2017-06-19T02:02:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1056-8727","1873-460X","10568727"],"journal":"Journal of Diabetes & its Complications","last_mentioned_on":1505048746,"links":["http:\/\/www.jdcjournal.com\/article\/S1056-8727%2817%2930122-8\/fulltext?rss=yes#.WUcu9yPJT1A.twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28735903?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1056872717301228?via%3Dihub"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jdcjournal.com\/article\/S1056872717301228\/pdf","pmid":"28735903","pubdate":"2017-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Genetics of non-syndromic childhood obesity and the use of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetics-nonsyndromic-childhood-obesity-highthroughput-dna-sequencing-technologies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":4,"6m":4,"3m":1.5,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392422,"mean":7.0682902969164,"rank":1850929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6480542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392422,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236835,"mean":12.911556271481,"rank":68817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":167508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236835,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":569,"mean":3.5080915492958,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":569,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.34375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":2,"GB":2,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrGPazFilho\/statuses\/876620963835596801","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21159725],"posted_on":"2017-06-19T02:01:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Gilberto Paz-Filho","url":"https:\/\/au.linkedin.com\/in\/pazfilho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1233559064\/mice1_normal.jpg","description":"Endocrinologist interested in obesity, leptin, thyroid disorders and genetics.
