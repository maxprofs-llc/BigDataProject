The present study used item response theory to compare unidimensional, correlated factors, bifactor, and modified bifactor models of ADHD symptoms in a clinical sample of youth ( N = 1,612) and examined differential item functioning (DIF) by age (<11 and \u226511 years) and gender. Results suggested that two restricted bifactor models showed superior fit compared with alternative models, and support strong general and inattention dimensions, with unreliable hyperactivity and impulsivity dimensions. No DIF was found across gender or age. The present study confirms that the general dimension (i.e., inhibition) and one specific dimension (i.e., sustained attention) represent distinct variability in ADHD symptoms that may improve prediction of symptom persistence, treatment response, or functional outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000233a","authors":["Sturm, Alexandra","McCracken, James T.","Cai, Li"],"doi":"10.1177\/1073191117714559","first_seen_on":"2017-06-18T10:28:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1073-1911","1552-3489"],"journal":"Assessment","last_mentioned_on":1497781686,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28621145?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28621145","pubdate":"2017-06-18T22:07:49+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Business And Management","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Evaluating the Hierarchical Structure of ADHD Symptoms and Invariance Across Age and Gender","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluating-hierarchical-structure-adhd-symptoms-invariance-across-age-gender"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":4478183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2335081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237872,"mean":12.856725805163,"rank":132214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237872,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":356,"mean":3.406985915493,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":356,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.97,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PROMresearch\/statuses\/876386027752964096","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21151470],"posted_on":"2017-06-18T10:28:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Chris Gibbons","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"PROMresearch","tweeter_id":"2921529663","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6},"tweet_id":"876386027752964096"}]}}
