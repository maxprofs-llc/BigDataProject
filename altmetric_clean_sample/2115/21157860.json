Midline pearls in the upper jaw were often cylindrical or rugby-ball shaped, whereas all pearls in the lower jaw were small and spherical. Epithelial pearls in the upper jaw started developing along the upper midline until 12 weeks; lateral pearls and additional midline pearls (or strictly, paramedian pearls) developed until 15 weeks. In the lower jaw, however, pearl development started at 18 weeks and was almost always from the dental lamina. Some of the fetuses assessed had an open nasopalatine canal without a duct, but there was no fibrous connection between this canal and pearls. Similarly, the lip frenulum or incisive suture was not connected with these pearls.\nThe timing and sequence of development suggest that postfusion rupture of the palate by midline pearls was unlikely.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000e0f","authors":["\n\t\t\t\t\tJi Hyun Kim","\n\t\t\t\t\tZhe Wu Jin","\n\t\t\t\t\tShunichi Shibata","\n\t\t\t\t\tJae Do Yang","\n\t\t\t\t\tGen Murakami","\n\t\t\t\t\tJos\u00e9 Francisco Rodr\u00edguez-V\u00e1zquez","\n\t\t\t\t\tBaik Hwan Cho"],"doi":"10.1597\/15-291","first_seen_on":"2017-06-18T22:20:28+00:00","issns":["1055-6656","1545-1569"],"journal":"The Cleft Palate - Craniofacial Journal","last_mentioned_on":1499473395,"links":["http:\/\/www.cpcjournal.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1597\/15-291?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"26752252","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" The American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Fetal Development of Human Oral Epithelial Pearls With Special Reference to Their Stage-Dependent Changes in Distribution","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fetal-development-human-oral-epithelial-pearls-special-reference-stagedependent-changes-distribution-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":1.6,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177940,"mean":6.9186814093318,"rank":3820129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4325062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177940,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210505,"mean":11.936131911983,"rank":94338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":114551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210505,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":540,"mean":4.7765640074212,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":540,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AmerCleftPalate\/statuses\/876565240992989184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21157860],"posted_on":"2017-06-18T22:20:13+00:00","author":{"name":"ACPA CLEFT","url":"http:\/\/www.acpa-cpf.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/893086519421935617\/LaWOGj7C_normal.jpg","description":"American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association.
