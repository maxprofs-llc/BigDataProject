By recognizing and cleaving specific DNA sequences, genome editing tools make it possible to generate site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the genome. DSBs will then be repaired by either error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or high-fidelity homologous recombination (HR) mechanisms. Through these two different mechanisms, endogenous genes can be knocked out or precisely repaired\/modified. Rapid developments in genome editing tools, especially CRISPR, have revolutionized human disease models generation; for example, various zebrafish, mouse, rat, pig, monkey and human cell lines have been constructed. Here, we review the developmental history of CRISPR and its application in studies of human diseases. In addition, we also briefly discussed the therapeutic application of CRISPR in the near future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c9a","authors":["Liang, Puping","Zhang, Xiya","Chen, Yuxi","Huang, Junjiu"],"doi":"10.1002\/jgm.2963","first_seen_on":"2017-06-18T10:27:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1099-498X","1521-2254"],"journal":"Journal of Gene Medicine - Gene Therapy Clinical Trial Database","last_mentioned_on":1497848775,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28623876?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28623876","pubdate":"2017-06-18T22:00:08+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Developmental history and application of CRISPR in human disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developmental-history-application-crispr-human-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":1.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":3772106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4527310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238015,"mean":12.860079785223,"rank":101908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":132494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238015,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":7.1012820512821,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.9625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
