Our study aim was to identify risk factors for fracture in children hospitalized in intensive and intermediate care units.\nWe conducted a retrospective, case-control study comparing the clinical characteristics of children with fractures (cases) to children without fractures (controls) matched for age, sex, hospital unit, admission quarter and year, ICU length of stay, severity of illness, and resource utilization. Bivariate comparisons and matched multivariable logistic regression modeling were used to determine associations between potential risk factors and fracture.\nMedian age at fracture for the 35 patients was 5.0 months (interquartile range 2.0 to 10.0 months) and at a comparable interval for the 70 matched controls was 3.5 months (interquartile range 2.0 to 7.0 months). In bivariate analyses, factors associated with fracture included: primary diagnosis of tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia and stenosis; diagnosis of kidney disease; and per 5-day increase in median cumulative ICU days at risk. In the final model, a respiratory disease diagnosis (odds ratio 3.9, 95% confidence interval 1.1-13.7) and per 5-day increase in median cumulative ICU days at risk (odds ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.6) were significant independent risk factors for fracture.\nChildren prone to fracture in the hospital are young, medically complex patients who require extended periods of intensive level medical care and potentially life-sustaining treatment modalities. The children who would benefit most from fracture reduction efforts are those with respiratory disease and prolonged ICU stays.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008dfb","authors":["Ian S.
