Although there is involvement of the distal airways at an early stage in mucus secreting lung diseases, no specific chest physical therapy (CPT) manoeuver has been proposed for small airways clearance. A four-tier classification of CPT has been established with identification of its benefits at each level of a monoalveolar respiratory tract model. The usual expiratory techniques directed towards the upper and middle respiratory tract are not applicable to the small airways and new paradigm is proposed appropriate to their specific mechanical characteristics. This comprises a slow resistive inspiratory manoeuver in the lateral position. Clinical auscultation of the lung is the cornerstone of the validation and follow-up of the technique.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008808","doi":"10.1016\/j.rmr.2013.11.009","first_seen_on":"2015-03-15T12:05:51+00:00","issns":["07618425"],"journal":"Revue des Maladies Respiratoires (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1422548937,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0761842514000357"],"pmid":"25012039","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"La kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapie respiratoire du poumon profond.
