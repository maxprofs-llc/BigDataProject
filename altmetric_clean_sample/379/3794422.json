The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed using cancer incidence rates of Italian Cancer Registries and official national data for overall mortality. The risk factors for death from all causes were assessed using Poisson regression models.\n1,195 cancer cases were diagnosed from 1986 to 2012: 700 AIDS-defining-cancers (ADCs) and 495 non-AIDS-defining-cancers (NADCs). ADC incidence was much higher than the Italian population (SIR\u2009=\u200930.8, 95% confidence interval 27.9-34.0) whereas NADC incidence was similar to the general population (SIR\u2009=\u20090.9, 95% CI 0.8-1.1). The SMR for all causes was 11.6 (11.1-12.0) in the period, and it decreased over time, mainly after 1996, up to 3.53 (2.5-4.8) in 2012. Male gender, year of enrolment before 1993, older age at enrolment, intravenous drug use, low CD4 cell count, AIDS event, cancer occurrence and the absence of antiretroviral therapy were all associated independently with risk of death.\nIn HIV infected patients, ADC but not NADC incidence rates were higher than the general population. Although overall mortality in HIV infected subjects decreased over time, it is about three-fold higher than the general population at present.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Raffetti, Elena","Albini, Laura","Gotti, Daria","Segala, Daniela","Maggiolo, Franco","di Filippo, Elisa","Saracino, Annalisa","Ladisa, Nicoletta","Lapadula, Giuseppe","Fornabaio, Chiara","Castelnuovo, Filippo","Casari, Salvatore","Fabbiani, Massimiliano","Pierotti, Piera","Donato, Francesco","Quiros-Roldan, Eugenia",", "],"doi":"10.1186\/s12889-015-1565-0","first_seen_on":"2015-03-16T14:22:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1426515684,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/15\/235\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12889-015-1565-0.pdf","pmid":"25884678","pubdate":"2015-03-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biostatistics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vaccine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"235","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Cancer incidence and mortality for all causes in HIV-infected patients over a quarter century: a multicentre cohort study","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cancer-incidence-mortality-causes-hivinfected-patients-quarter-century-multicentre-cohort-study-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4873658,"mean":5.8026048177008,"rank":3255091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1424874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4873658,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146677,"mean":10.222387575336,"rank":99771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":40005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146677,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5426,"mean":6.3676593548387,"rank":4408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5426,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":7.2111729957806,"rank":203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
