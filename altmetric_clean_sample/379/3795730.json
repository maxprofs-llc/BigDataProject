We examined the influence of anxiety, depression and SSRI on bruxism in social phobia (SP). Twenty-three drug na\u00efve, 17 SSRI-treated SP patients and 33 healthy controls underwent a psychiatric assessment and completed Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Oral parafunctional activity (PF) was evaluated by TM-dental examination and by a questionnaire. Drug- na\u00efve and SSRI-treated SP patients did not differ on demographic and clinical measures. Awake bruxism, 'JAW PLAY' and at least one PF were more prevalent in SP than in controls. Severity of SP predicted the presence of PF. SP, but not depression, was associated with higher risk of oral PF and awake bruxism. Chronic SSRI treatment of SP did not affect sleep and awake bruxism. Dental and anxiety screening may improve the prognosis psychiatric and dental patients. Effective treatment of SP may mitigate bruxism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9e","authors":["Hermesh H","Schapir L","Marom S","Skopski R","Barnea E","Weizman A","Winocur E","Hermesh, H.","Schapir, L.","Marom, S.","Skopski, R.","Barnea, E.","Weizman, A.","Winocur, E."],"doi":"10.1111\/joor.12235","endpage":"97","first_seen_on":"2015-03-16T23:11:06+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2842","0305-182X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Oral Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1431915692,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25238249","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/joor.12235\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/joor.12235\/pdf","pmid":"25238249","pubdate":"2014-09-23T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"90","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Bruxism and oral parafunctional hyperactivity in social phobia outpatients","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bruxism-oral-parafunctional-hyperactivity-social-phobia-outpatients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6395526,"mean":5.982299586664,"rank":318597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":6077097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6395526,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169304,"mean":9.9574896841758,"rank":15145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":154137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169304,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301,"mean":2.69526,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.0416666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
