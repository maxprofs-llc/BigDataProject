In this study, we investigated the effects of peanut white kernel and peanut skin on 3 strains of Lactobacillus and 3 major foodborne enteric bacterial pathogens. Significant (P < 0.05) growth stimulation of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus was observed in the presence of 0.5% peanut flour (PF) made from peanut white kernel, whereas 0.5% peanut skin extract (PSE) exerted the inhibitory effect on the growth of these beneficial microbes. We also found that within 72 h, PF inhibited growth of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC), while PSE significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited Listeria monocytogenes but promoted the growth of both EHEC and Salmonella Typhimurium. The cell adhesion and invasion abilities of 3 pathogens to the host cells were also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by 0.5% PF and 0.5% PSE. These results suggest that peanut white kernel might assist in improving human gut flora as well as reducing EHEC, whereas the beneficial effects of peanut skins require further research and investigation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fe9","authors":["Peng, Mengfei","Bitsko, Elizabeth","Biswas, Debabrata"],"doi":"10.1111\/1750-3841.12785","endpage":"M641","first_seen_on":"2015-03-16T08:54:55+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1750-3841","0022-1147","00221147"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Food Science","last_mentioned_on":1506302912,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1750-3841.12785\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1750-3841.12785\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1750-3841.12785\/pdf","pmid":"25627431","pubdate":"2015-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"M635","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Functional Properties of Peanut Fractions on the Growth of Probiotics and Foodborne Bacterial Pathogens","type":"article","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functional-properties-peanut-fractions-growth-probiotics-foodborne-bacterial-pathogens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":23,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":23},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":393736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":8066284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204933,"mean":9.5214564538482,"rank":14361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":190530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204933,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1772,"mean":7.0577086391869,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1772,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":5.3221481481481,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
