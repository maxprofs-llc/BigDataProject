Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a pro-fibrotic mediator that directly and indirectly influences the activation of myofibroblasts. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) promotes the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and can be regulated by IL-13. However, IL-13's downstream signaling pathways are not completely understood. We previously reported that the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is upregulated in fibroblasts treated with TGF-\u03b2 and in the lungs of mice and patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, YY1 directly regulates collagen and alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression in fibroblasts. However, it is not known if IL-13 regulates fibroblast activation through YY1 expression. We hypothesize that IL-13 up-regulates YY1 expression through regulation of AKT activation, leading to fibroblast activation. In this study we found that YY1 was upregulated by IL-13 in lung fibroblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner, resulting in increased \u03b1-SMA. Conversely, knockdown of YY1 blocked IL-13-induced \u03b1-SMA expression in fibroblasts. Furthermore, AKT phosphorylation was increased in fibroblasts treated with IL-13, and AKT overexpression upregulated YY1, whereas blockade of AKT phosphorylation suppressed the induction of YY1 by IL-13 in vitro. In vivo YY1 was upregulated in fibrotic lungs from CC10-IL-13 transgenic mice compared to that from wild-type littermates, which was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that IL-13 is a potent stimulator and activator of fibroblasts, at least in part, through AKT-mediated YY1 activation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jia Guo","Hongwei Yao","Xin Lin","Haodong Xu","David Dean","Zhou Zhu","Gang Liu","Patricia Sime"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0119039","first_seen_on":"2015-03-17T10:29:40+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1454670608,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25775215?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25775215?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25775215","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"IL-13 Induces YY1 through the AKT Pathway in Lung Fibroblasts.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/il13-induces-yy1-through-akt-pathway-lung-fibroblasts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7103144,"mean":6.3016585108842,"rank":6111145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7103144,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204458,"mean":9.0639451131535,"rank":169720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204458,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103691,"mean":10.050498698042,"rank":87412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103691,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4370,"mean":10.217136644541,"rank":3711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4370,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
