T-cell immunoglobulin-domain and mucin-domain 4 (TIM-4) is a type I cell-surface glycoprotein which is extensively expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC) like DC and macrophages. TIM-4 has been demonstrated to be implicated in mucosal allergy, skin allograft rejection and tumour-immune tolerance. However, the role of TIM-4 expressed on DC in hepatic IR injury remains largely unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether and how DC expressed TIM-4 was involved in hepatic IR injury. With segmental hepatic warm ischaemia mice models, we demonstrated that promoted DC infiltration and increased TIM-4 expression were induced by hepatic IR. Blockade of TIM-4 by anti-TIM-4 mAb (0.35mg\/mouse) markedly ameliorated hepatic injury and reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion. Furthermore, in a DC:CD4+ T cell co-culture system, blockade of TIM-4 on DC significantly inhibited T helper-2 cell differentiation and facilitated induced CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory cell (iTreg) expansion. Interleukin-4 (IL-4)\/signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat 6) signalling was shown to be impeded by TIM-4 blockade and involved in iTreg generation. Additionally, adoptive transfer of iTreg produced by TIM-4 blockade into hepatic IR mice models remarkably attenuated liver injury. We conclude that TIM-4 on DC play a critical role in hepatic IR injury and may be an efficient target for the prevention of liver or other organ IR injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003116","authors":["Ji Li","Xin Zhao","Xiaoliang Liu","Huanqiu Liu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molimm.2015.02.004","first_seen_on":"2015-03-17T15:46:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-9142"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecular Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1439449174,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25771178?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25771178","pubdate":"2015-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Disruption of TIM-4 in dendritic cell ameliorates hepatic warm IR injury through the induction of regulatory T cells.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disruption-tim4-dendritic-cell-ameliorates-hepatic-warm-ir-injury-through-induction-regulatory-t-cel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5481101,"mean":6.3653379577098,"rank":2722632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2593027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5481101,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166521,"mean":10.079183593562,"rank":86104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":73453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166521,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":848,"mean":1.7744840613932,"rank":363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":848,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":2.0307826086957,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
