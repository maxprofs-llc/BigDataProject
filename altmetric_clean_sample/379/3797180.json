Food intakes, eating patterns, and diet-risk factor interrelationships are described for 185 children (35% black, 65% white) using an improved 24-hr dietary recall method. Protein intakes were high. The polyunsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid ratio averaged 0.4 and a sucrose-to-starch proportion of 1.1 was noted. Eggs were the main food source of cholesterol and milk was the prime source of saturated fatty acids and protein. Black girls had a significantly greater mean sodium intake than the three other sex-race groups. Intermittent snacks provided the most calories; breakfast and dinner contributed most of the day's cholesterol, and lunch was the prime source of lactose and calcium. Longer eating spans reflected significantly greater intakes of calories, protein, fat, carbohydrate, and sodium, and greater levels of total serum cholesterol. A lack of correlations was noted in large matrices of dietary components and risk factor variables, but results of the comparison of mean intakes of dietary components for children grouped according to serum cholesterol showed significant differences in the intakes of various forms of fat and carbohydrate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["G C Frank","G S Berenson","L S Webber"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-17T05:45:42+00:00","issns":["0002-9165"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1422817648,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/623054"],"pmid":"623054","pubdate":"1978-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Dietary studies and the relationship of diet to cardiovascular disease risk factor variables in 10-year-old children--The Bogalusa Heart Study.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dietary-studies-relationship-diet-cardiovascular-disease-risk-factor-variables-10yearold-childrenthe-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8039046,"mean":6.825778771729,"rank":839796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7193174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8039046,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210592,"mean":9.2944867824363,"rank":31401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":178880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210592,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5948,"mean":26.47793643854,"rank":2362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5948,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":75.296688172043,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NL":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"vivereinforma","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=789659241125432&id=758349544256402","license":"public","citation_ids":[1765329,1765323,3797179,3797180,1166508,3797181,1390488,892155,849762,1892690,215006,867150,963892],"posted_on":"2015-02-01T19:07:28+00:00","summary":"Domanda & Risposta\n\nCarne rossa, grassi saturi e colesterolo\nA cura di Vincenzo Tortora\n\nD.\n\n\u00c8 vero che l\u2019assunzione di #carne, ricca di acidi grassi e #colesterolo, fa ammalare di #cuore?\n\nR.\n\nPu\u00f2 fare male al cuore, in senso etico, se ci tieni che gli an","author":{"name":"Best Performances","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/758349544256402","facebook_wall_name":"Best Performances","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/758349544256402\/picture","id_on_source":"758349544256402"}},{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=765760590175846&id=416817661736809","license":"public","citation_ids":[1765329,1765323,3797179,3797180,1166508,3797181,1390488,1390488,892155,849762,1892690,215006,867150,963892,963892],"posted_on":"2015-01-09T15:35:28+00:00","summary":"Domanda & Risposta\n\nCarne rossa, grassi saturi e colesterolo\nA cura di Vincenzo Tortora\n\nD.\n\n\u00c8 vero che l\u2019assunzione di #carne, ricca di acidi grassi e #colesterolo, fa ammalare di #cuore?\n\nR.\n\nPu\u00f2 fare male al cuore, in senso etico, se ci tieni che gli an","author":{"name":"vivereinforma","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/416817661736809","facebook_wall_name":"vivereinforma","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/416817661736809\/picture","id_on_source":"416817661736809"}},{"title":"vivereinforma","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1400279090268327&id=1397642240532012","license":"public","citation_ids":[1765329,1765323,3797179,3797180,1166508,3797181,1390488,1390488,892155,849762,1892690,215006,867150,963892,963892],"posted_on":"2015-01-10T13:14:50+00:00","summary":"Troppi pregiudizi....","author":{"name":"Nutrizionista Valentina Salsi","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1397642240532012","facebook_wall_name":"Nutrizionista Valentina Salsi","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1397642240532012\/picture","id_on_source":"1397642240532012"}}],"blogs":[{"title":"Is Meat Unhealthy?
