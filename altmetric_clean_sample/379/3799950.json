The Ecological Framework of Place (EFP) defines place as a socio-physical milieu involving people, the physical setting, and the program of the place, all catalyzed by situated human activity and fully acknowledging that all four may change over time. The article begins with a concise overview of the EFP before moving on to consider it within three theoretical terrains: place theory, developmental science theory, and environmental gerontology theory. The EFP will be argued to be a place theory which subsumes themes of emergent environmental gerontology theories within a developmental science perspective. Implications for theory, method and practice are discussed. One of the strengths of the model is its ability to serve both research and practice, as is exhibited in its ability to incorporate applied design research and inform architectural decision-making so often lacking in other environmental gerontology models. Place should be viewed as an integrative concept providing opportunities for both environmental gerontology and developmental science to more critically concern the profound role places have in terms of agency, identity and sense of self over the life course.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b16","authors":["Keith Diaz Moore"],"doi":"10.2190\/ag.79.3.a","endpage":"209","first_seen_on":"2015-03-17T18:21:37+00:00","issns":["1541-3535","0091-4150"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Aging & Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1426616464,"links":["http:\/\/ahd.sagepub.com\/content\/79\/3\/183.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ahd.sagepub.com\/content\/79\/3\/183.full.pdf","pmid":"25622472","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"183","title":"An Ecological Framework of Place: Situating Environmental Gerontology within a Life Course Perspective","type":"article","volume":"79","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ecological-framework-place-situating-environmental-gerontology-within-life-course-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4883853,"mean":5.8115531674627,"rank":3456019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":798219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4883853,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152454,"mean":10.024440489856,"rank":110641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152454,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":3.1486315789474,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
