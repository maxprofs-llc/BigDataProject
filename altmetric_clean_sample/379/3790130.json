One reason contributing to the high rates of breastfeeding discontinuation may be that primary care teams may not have sufficient knowledge to help mothers overcome problems experienced in the early days and may also give conflicting advice. Previous studies have shown that general practitioners are happy to participate in practice-based educational sessions and have expressed a need for breastfeeding education. This study was carried out as part of the training to achieve 'UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative in a community health care setting' status. It aimed to improve the breastfeeding expertise and advice about the management of breastfeeding problems within the primary care team using a CD-ROM breastfeeding learning package, and to assess the usefulness and acceptability of this educational intervention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000837","authors":["Jennifer Ingram"],"doi":"10.1186\/1746-4358-1-9","first_seen_on":"2015-03-15T11:43:12+00:00","issns":["1746-4358",""],"issue":"1","journal":"International Breastfeeding Journal","last_mentioned_on":1426419765,"links":["http:\/\/www.internationalbreastfeedingjournal.com\/content\/1\/1\/9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.internationalbreastfeedingjournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1746-4358-1-9.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1475559","pmid":"16722540","pubdate":"2006-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Maternal and Child Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"9","title":"Multiprofessional training for breastfeeding management in primary care in the UK","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiprofessional-training-breastfeeding-management-primary-care-uk-appendix-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7908616,"mean":6.6930297623486,"rank":4147326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2205353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7908616,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201699,"mean":9.2790534065782,"rank":107900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":73299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201699,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":8.2483225806452,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":14.7625,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
