Vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotube (VA-MWNT) electrodes are grown and populated with self-assembling silver nanoparticles via thermal evaporation. Due to the geometric and surface characteristics of VA-MWNTs, evaporated silver atoms form nanoparticles approximately 15-20 nm in diameter. The nanoparticles are well distributed on VA-MWNTs, with a 5-10 nm gap between particles. The size and gap of the self-assembled plasmonic nanoparticles is dependent upon both the length of the MWNT and the thickness of the evaporated silver. The wetting properties of water of the VA-MWNT electrodes change from hydrophilic (\u223c70\u00b0) to hydrophobic (\u223c120\u00b0) as a result of the evaporated silver. This effect is particularly pronounced on the VA-MWNT electrodes with a length of 1 \u03bcm, where the contact angle is altered from an initial 8\u00b0 to 124\u00b0. Based on UV-visible spectroscopic analysis, plasmonic resonance of the PIE systems occurs at a wavelength of approximately 400 nm. The optical behavior was found to vary as a function of MWNT length, with the exception of MWNT with a length of 1 \u03bcm. Using our PIE systems, we were able to obtain clear surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra with a detection limit of \u223c10 nM and an enhancement factor of \u223c10(6). This PIE system shows promise for use as a novel electrode system in next-generation optoelectronics such as photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and solar water splitting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Youngmin Kim"],"doi":"10.1021\/am505999e","first_seen_on":"2015-03-17T05:01:49+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1416381622,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/am505999e"],"pmid":"25384110","pubdate":"2014-11-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
