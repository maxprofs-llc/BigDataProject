Live music entrained to an infant's observed vital signs, provided by a certified music therapist with First Sounds RBL (rhythm, breath, and lullaby) training, enhanced bonding for infant-parent dyads and triads. The author's song of kin intervention, which employs parent-selected songs, is compared to the presentation of a well-known folk theme (\"Twinkle\") in 272 neonates. Culturally based, parent-selected, personalized musical tunes provided in song, as a noninvasive intervention, foster optimal, continuous quality of care. Music psychotherapy sessions for parents before working with their infants can instill a potent means of nonconfrontational support, allowing for expression of fear or anxiety related to the premature birth. Although most attention is typically directed to their infant, using music can support the parents' grief and assist in the expression of hope that can instill a sense of security and containment. From the NICU to home, a familiar thread-line theme can be resourced directly from the family and\/or parent and applied effortlessly throughout the growing baby's transitional moments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51b3cf058f6100038d2","authors":["Loewy J","Loewy, Joanne"],"doi":"10.1111\/nyas.12648","endpage":"185","first_seen_on":"2015-03-15T21:50:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1749-6632","0077-8923"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1449763288,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fnyas.12648#.VQUjpXg_nXw.facebook","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nyas.12648\/abstract;jsessionid=CBD0CD81A8B6C12AA3D12B0C148AE495.f01t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nyas.12648\/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+21st+March+from+10%3A30+GMT+up+to+six+hours+and+from+05%3A30+EDT+up+to+six+hours+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nyas.12648\/abstract;jsessionid=EE182F1E8C8C0740E61BAC898D4D9157.f02t02","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25773633?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nyas.12648\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/nyas.12648","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/nyas.12648#.VQbaOP46ci0.facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25773633\/?utm_content=bufferecfdd&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/nyas.12648\/pdf","pmid":"25773633","pubdate":"2015-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"178","subjects":["science"],"title":"NICU music therapy: song of kin as critical lullaby in research and practice.","type":"article","volume":"1337","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nicu-music-therapy-song-kin-critical-lullaby-research-practice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6737133,"mean":6.1593032756354,"rank":2360180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4326419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6737133,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195337,"mean":9.0993986361963,"rank":66395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":127098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195337,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3607,"mean":5.0573998890738,"rank":2144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3607,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":3.6049803921569,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":5,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
