It is proposed that REM sleep pathways, which can be triggered by acetylcholine accumulation in the pontomedullar reticular field, mediate respiratory failure through the inhibition of respiratory muscles. Cholinergic activation of REM sleep activities may also account for other physiological and behavioural effects that follow exposure to nerve agents. These include forebrain activation, which is associated with EEG desynchronization and seizures, locomotor depression with concomitant loss of righting reflex, and limb jerks and extensions. Pharmacologic evidence for atropine and clonidine protection against soman intoxication effects is entirely consistent with a scenario of cholinergic receptor activation in the pontomedullar reticular field.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008126","authors":["Kok, A"],"first_seen_on":"2016-12-04T08:03:01+00:00","issns":["0306-9877"],"issue":"2","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","last_mentioned_on":1480838568,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/8231994\/"],"pmid":"8231994","pubdate":"1993-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"REM sleep pathways and anticholinesterase intoxication: a mechanism for nerve agent-induced, central respiratory failure.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rem-sleep-pathways-anticholinesterase-intoxication-mechanism-nerve-agentinduced-central-respiratory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":4110412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2186327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251149,"mean":12.269841575485,"rank":138280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251149,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2089,"mean":6.6829099616858,"rank":1248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2089,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":5.1808823529412,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
