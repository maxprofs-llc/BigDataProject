This paper presents findings of a meta-narrative literature review to discuss the potential for IT to improve the quality of clinical research informed consent. The review reveals three main rationales for including IT in research consent. First, in the current context consent documents frequently fail to be effective decision aids for patients, and the lack of patient centricity in the process. Second, social media provides opportunities for patients to consult with a broader community during research consent to seek broader support, and potential to participate in creating a more patient centric process. Third, multimedia tools provide opportunities for improved patient education, engagement and decision making during research consent. IT offers opportunities to achieve more meaningful research consent, but more research is needed to create an evidence base, policies and economic analyses on the return on investment of using IT in the process.","aggregate_citation_ids":[],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67f3cf058f6100098a4","authors":["Taber, Celia","Warren, Jim","Day, Karen"],"doi":"10.3233\/978-1-61499-712-2-135","first_seen_on":"2016-11-14T12:37:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":["9781614997115"],"issns":["0926-9630"],"journal":"Studies in Health Technology & Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1479127186,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27782025","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3233\/978-1-61499-712-2-135"],"pmid":"27782025","pubdate":"2017-01-13T09:11:37+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Improving the Quality of Informed Consent in Clinical Research with Information Technology.","type":"book","volume":"231","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-quality-informed-consent-clinical-research-information-technology-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446939,"mean":7.1011837842224,"rank":4266282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3962360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446939,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238995,"mean":13.125303815158,"rank":122822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":107885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238995,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1168,"mean":1.6726632390746,"rank":360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1168,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/anetto\/statuses\/798142828995981312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13589488],"posted_on":"2016-11-14T12:37:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Annette McKinnon","url":"http:\/\/yourgoldwatch.blogspot.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/745352997685858304\/PZQteVmi_normal.jpg","description":"Health and patient voice blogger.
