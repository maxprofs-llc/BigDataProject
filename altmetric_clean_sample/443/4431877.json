Because of the intricate relationship between cancer cells and immune cells, we aimed to identify both cancer cell and immune cell expressed biomarkers. Using a novel approach, we isolated RNA from flow-sorted viable EpCAM+ tumor epithelial cells and CD45+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells obtained from squamous cell cervical cancer samples (n = 24). Total RNA was sequenced and differential gene expression analysis of the CD45+ immune cell fractions identified TCL1A as a novel marker for predicting improved survival (p = 0.007). This finding was validated using qRT-PCR (p = 0.005) and partially validated using immunohistochemistry (p = 0.083). Importantly, TCL1A was found to be expressed in a subpopulation of B cells (CD3-\/CD19+\/CD10+\/CD34-) using multicolor immunofluorescence. A high TCL1A\/CD20 (B cell) ratio, determined in total tumor samples from a separate patient cohort using qRT-PCR (n = 52), was also correlated with improved survival (p = 0.027). This is the first study demonstrating the prognostic value of separating tumor epithelial cells from tumor-infiltrating immune cells and determining their RNA expression profile for identifying putative cancer biomarkers. Our results suggest that intratumoral TCL1A+ B cells are important for controlling cervical cancer development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Punt, Simone","Corver, Willem E","van der Zeeuw, Sander A J","Kielbasa, Szymon M","Osse, Elisabeth M","Buermans, Henk P J","de Kroon, Cornelis D","Jordanova, Ekaterina S","Gorter, Arko"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.4526","first_seen_on":"2015-08-25T12:01:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"36","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1440504040,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26299617"],"pmcid":"PMC4770729","pmid":"26299617","pubdate":"2015-08-25T22:01:09+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Whole-transcriptome analysis of flow-sorted cervical cancer samples reveals that B cell expressed TCL1A is correlated with improved survival.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.oncotarget.com\/abstract\/4526","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wholetranscriptome-analysis-flowsorted-cervical-cancer-samples-reveals-b-cell-expressed-tcl1a-correl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7419460,"mean":6.4513302703028,"rank":6422693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7419460,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227732,"mean":8.7907001154872,"rank":188969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227732,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6685,"mean":2.8463641532017,"rank":4786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6685,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":698,"mean":2.0061233859397,"rank":484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":698,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
