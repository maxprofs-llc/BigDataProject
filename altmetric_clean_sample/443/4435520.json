The records of 258 patients who received an RC and IC and 121 who received an RC and NB were reviewed for the present study. Using a binary logistic regression model a propensity score was generated for the following factors: sex, age, smoking habit, Charlson score, American Society of Anesthesiology score, preoperative hydronephrosis, and pathologic T stage. Two groups of patients with similar propensity scores were created with a ratio of 1:1, one group who received an IC and another who received an NB. The following features were compared between the 2 groups: blood loss, intraoperative complication rate, time to oral intake resumption, postoperative complication rate (overall, Clavien classification 1-2, Clavien classification 3-5, related to RC, related to urinary reconstruction).\nIn total, 170 patients were selected; 85 with NB, 85 with IC, and the 2 groups were well matched according to the desired features. No differences were noted for all of the compared features.\nThe morbidity of RC does not seem to be affected by the choice of IC versus NB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003a82","authors":["Antonelli, Alessandro","Belotti, Sandra","Cristinelli, Luca","De Luca, Vincenzo","Simeone, Claudio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clgc.2015.07.011","first_seen_on":"2015-08-26T02:41:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1558-7673","1938-0682"],"journal":"Clinical Genitourinary Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1439899219,"links":["http:\/\/www.clinical-genitourinary-cancer.com\/article\/S1558-7673(15)00184-6\/abstract?rss=yes&sf11786953=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.clinical-genitourinary-cancer.com\/article\/S1558767315001846\/pdf","pmid":"26362072","pubdate":"2015-09-13T22:00:38+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Comparison of peri-operative morbidity of radical cystectomy with neobladder versus ileal conduit: a matched pair analysis on 170 patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-perioperative-morbidity-radical-cystectomy-neobladder-versus-ileal-conduit-matched-pair-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5557408,"mean":6.3234363983063,"rank":4633720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5557408,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193536,"mean":9.3704720799855,"rank":154981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193536,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196,"mean":1.9120512820513,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.0722222222222,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
