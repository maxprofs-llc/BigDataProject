The aim of this study is to monitor the healing and activity limitations related to Bohler iron plaster cast (BIPC) when used for offloading diabetic neuropathic plantar foot ulcers. Thirty patients were cast for 1\u00a0month and evaluated for healing using the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH), and for activity limitation using the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS). The change in the scores after intervention was the outcome measure. There was good healing as evidenced by a statistical difference in mean PUSH scores. The baseline PUSH score of 9.76-0.41 (T1-SEM) was greater than follow-up PUSH score of 6.32\u2009+\u20090.41 (T2\u2009+\u2009SEM) and the p value <0.0001. Improvement was seen in ulcer area, exudate, and tissue type. There was no mobility effect as there was no significant difference in LEFS. Significant negative correlation was there between PUSH and LEFS. The r value was less than -0.7 both at baseline and after intervention. The combined benefits of good healing, lack of affect on lower extremity function, the ease of application and dressing, and relative affordability make BIPC a commendable offloading modality for the management of diabetic plantar ulcers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ab2","authors":["Priyanka Saikia","Rajalakshmi Hariharan","Nachiket Shankar","Anil Kumar Gaur","Naveen Matthew Jose"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12262-015-1327-3","first_seen_on":"2015-08-26T00:15:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0973-9793","0972-2068"],"issue":"2","journal":"Indian Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1440548127,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12262-015-1327-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12262-015-1327-3.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4875896","pmid":"27303118","pubdate":"2015-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer India","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiac Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatric Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plastic Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Thoracic Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Effective and Economic Offloading of Diabetic Foot Ulcers in India with the Bohler Iron Plaster Cast","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effective-economic-offloading-diabetic-foot-ulcers-india-bohler-iron-plaster-cast"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5526298,"mean":6.3979855686372,"rank":4598276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5526298,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193872,"mean":9.3753951029292,"rank":155309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193872,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":388,"mean":0.77027906976744,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":388,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.50185185185185,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":3,"Sports and Recreations":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"IN":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SurgeryScience\/statuses\/636331084964233217","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4434696],"posted_on":"2015-08-26T00:15:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Surgical Research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/552556384688939009\/rWmyj-8R_normal.jpeg","description":"Latest surgical research journal papers as they're published | Academic updates and CME | @DrEdFitzgerald","id_on_source":"SurgeryScience","tweeter_id":"2707749445","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2180},"tweet_id":"636331084964233217"}]}}
