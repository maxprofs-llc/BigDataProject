We performed a meta-analysis assessing the impact of antihypertensives on cSBP and AI.\nPubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were searched until September 2014 to identify eligible articles. A DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Fifty-two and 58 studies incorporating 4,381 and 3,716 unique subjects were included for cSBP and AI analysis, respectively.\nOverall, antihypertensives reduced pSBP more than cSBP (WMD 2.52mm Hg, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.69; I (2) = 21.9%). \u03b2-Blockers (BBs) posed a significantly greater reduction in pSBP as compared to cSBP (WMD 5.19mm Hg, 95% CI 3.21 to 7.18). \u03b1-Blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors and nicorandil reduced cSBP and pSBP in a similar manner. The overall reduction in AI from baseline was 3.09% (95% CI 2.28 to 3.90; I (2) = 84.5%). A significant reduction in AI was seen with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors, BBs, \u03b1-blockers (ABs), nicorandil, and moxonidine reduced AI nonsignificantly.\nBBs are not as beneficial as the other antihypertensives in reducing cSBP and AI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697a","authors":["McGaughey, Tracey J","Fletcher, Emily A","Shah, Sachin A"],"doi":"10.1093\/ajh\/hpv134","first_seen_on":"2015-08-25T15:26:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1941-7225","0895-7061"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Journal of Hypertension (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1460662983,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26289583"],"pmid":"26289583","pubdate":"2016-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Impact of Antihypertensive Agents on Central Systolic Blood Pressure and Augmentation Index: A Meta-Analysis.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-antihypertensive-agents-central-systolic-blood-pressure-augmentation-index-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":5715493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1010803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228599,"mean":8.8058948634722,"rank":157737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":38477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228599,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":738,"mean":8.7373731343284,"rank":554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":738,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":4.6805555555556,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
