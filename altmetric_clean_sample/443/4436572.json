Surgery remains is most effective method, able to extend the life of these patients. The results of treatment of 126 patients with sm-CRC were analyzed, whom performed simultaneous (group I) or staged (group II) surgery. Simultaneous resection of 3 segments of liver or less with metastases and primary tumor is a safe surgical strategy (complicatios level was 4.8%); simultaneous resection of 3 segments of liver or more increase the complicatios level to 20.9%. Simultaneous resection ensure reduction of hospital stay terms in 58.1% and duration of surgery in 71.3% (p < 0.001). The average cost of treatment patient treating with staged strategy exceeded in simultaneous surgical treatment in 40.9%.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa91f3cf058f61000d6bb","authors":["Shchepotin, S B","Kolesnik, O O","Burlaka, A A","Lukashenko, A V","Pryimak, V V"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-26T10:04:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0023-2130"],"issue":"4","journal":"Klinicheskaia khirurgiia","last_mentioned_on":1440583476,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26263637?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26263637","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"[RESULTS OF PATIENTS SURGICAL TREATMENT WITH COLDRECTAL CANCER AND SYNCHRONOUS LIVER METASTASIS].","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5552343,"mean":6.3814313062833,"rank":4623295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5552343,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193971,"mean":9.3748734546578,"rank":155384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193971,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":0.41052631578947,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.5625,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/636479346941673472","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4436572],"posted_on":"2015-08-26T10:04:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"636479346941673472"}]}}
