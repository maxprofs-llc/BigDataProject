We aimed to investigate the relationship between multifocal VEP (mfVEP) latency and optic nerve lesion length after acute ON.\nThirty acute ON patients were studied at 1,3,6 and 12 months using mfVEP and at 1 and 12 months with optic nerve MRI. LogMAR and low contrast visual acuity were documented. By one month, the mfVEP amplitude had recovered sufficiently for latency to be measured in 23 (76.7%) patients with seven patients having no recordable mfVEP in more than 66% of segments in at least one test. Only data from these 23 patients was analysed further.\nBoth latency and lesion length showed significant recovery during the follow-up period. Lesion length and mfVEP latency were highly correlated at 1 (r = 0.94, p = <0.0001) and 12 months (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). Both measures demonstrated a similar trend of recovery. Speed of latency recovery was faster in the early follow-up period while lesion length shortening remained relatively constant. At 1 month, latency delay was worse by 1.76ms for additional 1mm of lesion length while at 12 months, 1mm of lesion length accounted for 1.94ms of latency delay.\nA strong association between two putative measures of demyelination in early and chronic ON was found. Parallel recovery of both measures could reflect optic nerve remyelination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Anneke van der Walt","Scott Kolbe","Peter Mitchell","Yejun Wang","Helmut Butzkueven","Gary Egan","Con Yiannikas","Stuart Graham","Trevor Kilpatrick","Alexander Klistorner","van der Walt, Anneke","Kolbe, Scott","Mitchell, Peter","Wang, Yejun","Butzkueven, Helmut","Egan, Gary","Yiannikas, Con","Graham, Stuart","Kilpatrick, Trevor","Klistorner, Alexander","Laura Frishman"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0121084","first_seen_on":"2015-08-26T16:51:46+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1435573840,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0121084","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0121084"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0121084.PDF","pmid":"26020925","pubdate":"2015-05-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0121084","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Parallel Changes in Structural and Functional Measures of Optic Nerve Myelination after Optic Neuritis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0121084","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parallel-changes-structural-functional-measures-optic-nerve-myelination-after-optic-neuritis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5291770,"mean":6.2217234724363,"rank":4406509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5291770,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187554,"mean":9.4377849994402,"rank":150242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187554,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92640,"mean":9.5193062964842,"rank":77466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92640,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6093,"mean":8.0682774130007,"rank":5113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6093,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
