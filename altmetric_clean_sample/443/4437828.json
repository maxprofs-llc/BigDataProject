Combined with cellular processes such as cell type specification, proliferation, differentiation, and migration, all of these developmental processes result in the establishment of an adult mammalian cortex with its typical lamination and regional patterning. By examining in-depth the role of one transcription factor, Pax6, on the regulation of cortical development, its integration in the regulation of chromatin state, and its regulation by cis-regulatory elements, we aim to demonstrate the importance of integrating each level of regulation in our understanding of cortical development.
