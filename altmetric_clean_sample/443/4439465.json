In this study, we aimed to assess whether birth order was associated with height and BMI in a large cohort of Swedish women.\nInformation was obtained from antenatal clinic records from the Swedish National Birth Register over 20\u2005years (1991-2009). Maternal anthropometric data early in pregnancy (at approximately 10-12\u2005weeks of gestation) were analysed on 13\u2005406 pairs of sisters who were either first-born or second-born (n=26\u2005812).\nEarly in pregnancy, first-born women were of BMI that was 0.57\u2005kg\/m(2) (2.4%) greater than their second-born sisters (p<0.0001). In addition, first-borns had greater odds of being overweight (OR 1.29; p<0.0001) or obese (OR 1.40; p<0.0001) than second-borns. First-borns were also negligibly taller (+1.2\u2005mm) than their second-born sisters. Of note, there was a considerable increase in BMI over the 18-year period covered by this study, with an increment of 0.11\u2005kg\/m(2) per year (p<0.0001).\nOur study corroborates other large studies on men, and the steady reduction in family size may contribute to the observed increase in adult BMI worldwide.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8083cf058f61000ba9f","authors":["Jos\u00e9 G B
