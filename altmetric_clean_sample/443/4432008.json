Here we first studied in silico the evolution of protease resistance. Primary active site resistance mutations were found to weaken interactions between protease and both inhibitor and substrate P4-P4' residues. We next studied the effects of secondary resistance mutations, often distant from the active site, on protease binding to inhibitors and substrates. Those secondary mutations contributed to the rise of multi-drug resistance while also enhancing viral replicative capacity. Here many secondary resistance mutations were found in the HIV-1 protease substrate-grooves, one on each face of the symmetrical protease dimer. The protease active site binds substrate P4-P4' residues, while the substrate-groove allows the protease to bind residues P12-P5\/P5'-P12', for a total of twenty-four residues. The substrate-groove secondary resistance mutations were found to compensate for the loss of interactions between the inhibitor resistant protease active site and substrate P4-P4' residues, due to primary resistance mutations, by increasing interactions with substrate P12-P5\/P5'-P12' residues. In vitro experiments demonstrated that a multi-drug resistant protease with substrate-groove resistance mutations was slower than wild-type protease in cleaving a peptide substrate, which did not allow for substrate-groove interactions, while it had similar activity as wild-type protease when using a Gag polyprotein in which cleavage-site P12-P5\/P5'-P12' residues could be bound by the protease substrate-grooves. When the Gag MA\/CA cleavage site P12-P5\/P5'-P12' residues were mutated the multi-drug resistant protease cleaved the mutant Gag significantly slower, indicating the importance of the protease S-grooves in binding to substrate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c8","authors":["Laco, Gary S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biochi.2015.08.009","endpage":"103","first_seen_on":"2015-08-25T12:19:12+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1638-6183","03009084"],"journal":"Biochimie","last_mentioned_on":1472121840,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26300060?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26300060?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26300060?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26300060","pubdate":"2015-08-25T22:00:58+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"90","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"HIV-1 Protease Substrate-groove: Role in Substrate Recognition and Inhibitor Resistance.","type":"article","volume":"118","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hiv1-protease-substrategroove-role-substrate-recognition-inhibitor-resistance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":4162055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3903283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232571,"mean":9.0135119490906,"rank":111269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":111534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232571,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":866,"mean":3.1536369942197,"rank":444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":866,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":3.8054736842105,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
