We have recently identified a novel adipokine Metrnl, also known as Subfatin for its high expression in subcutaneous fat. Here, we demonstrate a pro-differentiation action of Metrnl in white adipocytes. Adipocyte-specific knockout of Metrnl exacerbates insulin resistance induced by high fat diet, while adipocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of Metrnl prevents insulin resistance induced by high fat diet or leptin deletion. Body weight and adipose content are not changed by adipocyte Metrnl. Consistently, no correlation is found between serum Metrnl level and body mass index in humans. Metrnl promotes white adipocyte differentiation, expandability, lipid metabolism and inhibits adipose inflammation to form functional fat, which contributes to its activity against insulin resistance. The insulin sensitization of Metrnl is blocked by PPAR\u03b3 inhibitors or knockdown. However, Metrnl does not drive white adipose browning. Acute intravenous injection of recombinant Metrnl has no hypoglycemic effect, and one-week intravenous administration of Metrnl is unable to rescue insulin resistance exacerbated by adipocyte Metrnl deficiency. Our results suggest adipocyte Metrnl controls insulin sensitivity at least via its local autocrine\/paracrine action through PPAR\u03b3 pathway. Adipocyte Metrnl is an inherent insulin-sensitizer and may become a therapeutic target for insulin resistance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f7","authors":["Zhi-Yong Li","Jie Song","Si-Li Zheng","Mao-Bing Fan","Yun-Feng Guan","Yi Qu","Jian Xu","Pei Wang","Chao-Yu Miao"],"doi":"10.2337\/db15-0274","first_seen_on":"2015-08-26T05:11:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1939-327X"],"journal":"Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1448423573,"links":["http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/24\/db15-0274.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/24\/db15-0274.short?rss=1","http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/24\/db15-0274.abstract","http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/64\/12\/4011.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/24\/db15-0274.full.pdf","pmid":"26307585","pubdate":"2015-08-27T22:00:53+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Adipocyte Metrnl Antagonizes Insulin Resistance Through PPAR\u03b3 Signaling","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adipocyte-metrnl-antagonizes-insulin-resistance-through-pparg-signaling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6606474,"mean":6.1300731649094,"rank":1472211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5107258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6606474,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199667,"mean":9.4857582562882,"rank":59643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":139067,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199667,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3420,"mean":7.038569757239,"rank":1099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3420,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128,"mean":7.0889291338583,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
