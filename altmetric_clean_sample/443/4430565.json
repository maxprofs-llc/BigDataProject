The variables used to describe MSNA, and the criteria by which these variables are quantified from the integrated neurogram, vary among studies and laboratories and, therefore, can become confusing to those starting to learn the technique. Therefore, the purpose of this educational review is to discuss guidelines and standards for the assessment of sympathetic nervous activity through the collection and analysis of MSNA. This review will reiterate common practices in the collection of MSNA, but will also introduce considerations for the evaluation and physiological inference using MSNA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002383","authors":["White, Daniel W","Shoemaker, J Kevin","Raven, Peter B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.autneu.2015.08.004","first_seen_on":"2015-08-25T07:54:32+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1566-0702","1872-7484"],"journal":"Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic & Clinical","last_mentioned_on":1440489250,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1566070215300175"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.autonomicneuroscience.com\/article\/S1566070215300175\/pdf","pmid":"26299824","pubdate":"2015-08-25T22:01:05+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Methods and considerations for the analysis and standardization of assessing muscle sympathetic nerve activity in humans","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methods-considerations-analysis-standardization-assessing-muscle-sympathetic-nerve-activity-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5526446,"mean":6.3981344242107,"rank":4598356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5526446,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194206,"mean":9.3741949383383,"rank":155581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194206,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":376,"mean":1.4733226666667,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":376,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.4,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
