Furthermore, distinctive features of visual perception, such as markedly reduced eye contact and a tendency to focus more on small, visual items than on holistic perception, have long been recognized as typical ASD characteristics. Recent debate in the scientific community discusses whether the physiology of low-level visual perception might explain such higher visual abnormalities. While reports of this enhanced, \"eagle-like\" visual acuity contained methodological errors and could not be substantiated, several authors have reported alterations in even earlier stages of visual processing, such as contrast perception and motion perception at the occipital cortex level. Therefore, in this project, we have investigated the electrophysiology of very early visual processing by analyzing the pattern electroretinogram-based contrast gain, the background noise amplitude, and the psychophysical visual acuities of participants with high-functioning ASD and controls with equal education. Based on earlier findings, we hypothesized that alterations in early vision would be present in ASD participants. This study included 33 individuals with ASD (11 female) and 33 control individuals (12 female). The groups were matched in terms of age, gender, and education level. We found no evidence of altered electrophysiological retinal contrast processing or psychophysical measured visual acuities. There appears to be no evidence for abnormalities in retinal visual processing in ASD patients, at least with respect to contrast detection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc0e","authors":["Tebartz van Elst, Ludger","Bach, Michael","Blessing, Julia","Riedel, Andreas","Bubl, Emanuel"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnhum.2015.00460","first_seen_on":"2015-08-26T08:12:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-5161"],"journal":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1442574696,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnhum.2015.00460\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26379525?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnhum.2015.00460\/pdf","pmid":"26379525","pubdate":"2015-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Normal Visual Acuity and Electrophysiological Contrast Gain in Adults with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/normal-visual-acuity-electrophysiological-contrast-gain-adults-highfunctioning-autism-spectrum-disor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6364199,"mean":5.83819851048,"rank":4702582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":942373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6364199,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195889,"mean":9.3672969656131,"rank":135237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195889,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3336,"mean":10.273056671664,"rank":2828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3336,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":6.0478095238095,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
