Glucose ingestion does not improve maximal isokinetic force. J Strength Cond Res 30(1): 194-199, 2016-The purpose of this study was to assess maximal isokinetic leg extension force in response to glucose ingestion and to determine whether any performance changes occur in a time-dependent manner. Seventeen young (22.1 \u00b1 3.9 years), lean (%body fat [%BF]: 14.3 \u00b1 8.0; %BF males: 9.7 \u00b1 4.2; %BF females: 23.7 \u00b1 4.2), and recreationally active (>150 min\u00b7wk of physical activity) male (n = 11) and female participants completed the trials. Using a double-blinded crossover design, participants performed sets of 3 maximum isokinetic efforts on a dynamometer (HumacNorm) before and after (5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 minutes after) ingesting either a carbohydrate (75 g glucose) or isovolumic placebo (saccharin-flavored) drink. Blood glucose and electromyography (EMG) were recorded concurrent with force output (max peak force; mean peak force). Despite a significant rise in blood glucose (mean glycemic excursion = 4.01 \u00b1 1.18 mmol\u00b7L), there were no significant interactions in any (absolute or percentage) force (mean peak force: p \u2265 0.683; max peak force: p \u2265 0.567) or EMG (mean peak EMG: p \u2265 0.119; max peak EMG: p \u2265 0.247) parameters measured. The ingestion of glucose resulted in a 3.4% reduction in mean force across subsequent time points (highest: +2.1% at 15 minutes; lowest: -8.6% at 90 minutes after ingestion); however, this effect was small (d < 0.1). The ingestion of glucose does not alter performance of maximal isokinetic efforts in recreationally active young individuals. Additionally, there were no differences in force when assessed as a function of time after glucose ingestion. Consequently, in the absence of fatigue, carbohydrate ingestion is unlikely to present any ergogenic benefits to athletes performing resistance-based exercise.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Fairchild, Timothy J","Dillon, Paul","Curtis, Caroline","Dempsey, Alasdair R"],"doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0000000000001057","endpage":"199","first_seen_on":"2015-08-26T07:30:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1064-8011","1533-4287"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1478783203,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/9000\/00000\/Glucose_ingestion_does_not_improve_maximal.96872.pdf","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/_layouts\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=01000&article=00022#ath","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Glucose_ingestion_does_not_improve_maximal.96872.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/2016\/01000\/Glucose_Ingestion_Does_Not_Improve_Maximal.22.aspx","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26691410"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/9000\/00000\/Glucose_ingestion_does_not_improve_maximal.96872.pdf","pmid":"26691410","pubdate":"2015-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"194","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Glucose Ingestion Does Not Improve Maximal Isokinetic Force","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glucose-ingestion-not-improve-maximal-isokinetic-force"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.55,"score_history":{"1y":3.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7672691,"mean":6.5915218985731,"rank":1009972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6660586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7672691,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229044,"mean":8.8252344232306,"rank":39536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":189425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229044,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3657,"mean":16.157440919037,"rank":1649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3657,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":19.729953125,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":8,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1,"SE":1,"US":2,"JP":1},"mendeley":{"NO":1,"BR":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ARDempsey\/statuses\/636440409854513152","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4436053],"posted_on":"2015-08-26T07:29:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Alasdair Dempsey","url":"http:\/\/profiles.murdoch.edu.au\/myprofile\/alasdair-dempsey\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3336831381\/688c0a72a51649a10176ecee37793367_normal.jpeg","description":"Senior Lecturer in Biomechanics @MurdochUni.
