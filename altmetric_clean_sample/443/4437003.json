Therefore, we investigate here the testing behaviors and barriers among a diverse national sample of AGBM.\nA total of 302 AGBM aged 14-18\u00a0years were recruited via Facebook ads to participate in an mHealth (text messaging-based) HIV prevention program. Recruitment was stratified to ensure approximately 50% were sexually inexperienced.\nOnly 30% of sexually active participants had ever been tested for HIV, and nearly half of them did not know where they could go to get tested for HIV (42.9%). Based on exploratory factor analysis, nine questions assessing potential barriers to HIV testing factored into three subscales: external factors, fear, and feelings of invincibility. Among sexually active participants, those who had never tested for HIV had significantly greater scores on the external factors (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.66) and fear (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-3.19) subscale. Older (16-18\u00a0years old) youth were especially likely to be affected by external factor barriers, and fear was associated with never testing among gay-identified individuals.\nHIV testing rates were low among AGBM. Several modifiable barriers emerged, especially a lack of knowledge about the closest testing site. Interventions and programs that target high school-age adolescents could address external barriers by introducing HIV testing services into high schools.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059ec","authors":["Phillips, Gregory","Ybarra, Michele L","Prescott, Tonya L","Parsons, Jeffrey T","Mustanski, Brian","Gregory Phillips","Michele L.
