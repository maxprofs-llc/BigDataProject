Fungi are simple models, where compatibility is based on the recognition of pheromone peptides by corresponding receptor proteins, but clear patterns of diversification have not emerged from the species examined, which are few compared with mate signaling studies in plant and animal systems. In this study, candidate loci from Microbotryum species were used to characterize putative pheromones that were synthesized and found to be functional across multiple species in triggering a mating response in vitro. There is no significant correlation between the strength of a species' response and its genetic distance from the pheromone sequence source genome. Instead, evidence suggests that species may be strong or weak responders, influenced by environmental conditions or developmental differences. Gene sequence comparisons reveals very strong purifying selection on the a1 pheromone peptide and corresponding receptor, but significantly less purifying selection on the a2 pheromone peptide that corresponds with more variation across species in the receptor. This represents an exceptional case of a reciprocally interacting mate-recognition system in which the two mating types are under different levels of purifying selection.Heredity advance online publication, 26 August 2015; doi:10.1038\/hdy.2015.68.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029dd","authors":["L Xu","E Petit","M E Hood"],"doi":"10.1038\/hdy.2015.68","first_seen_on":"2015-08-26T12:55:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0018-067X","1365-2540"],"journal":"Heredity","last_mentioned_on":1449834948,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/hdy\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/hdy201568a.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/hdy\/rss\/aop\/~3\/Gvz-AivFuMY\/hdy.2015.68","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/hdy\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/hdy201568a.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_HDY","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/hdy\/journal\/v116\/n1\/abs\/hdy201568a.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_HDY"],"pmid":"26306729","pubdate":"2015-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Molecular evolution","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Variation in mate-recognition pheromones of the fungal genus Microbotryum","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/variation-materecognition-pheromones-fungal-genus-microbotryum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6738406,"mean":6.1618062182355,"rank":627262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6084853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6738406,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224693,"mean":8.6831697078669,"rank":30291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":193716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224693,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":963,"mean":7.0603866943867,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":963,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":12.746214285714,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
