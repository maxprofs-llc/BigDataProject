We identified 1771 patients who underwent simultaneous (same-day) bilateral TKA and matched them to a control group of 6790 patients who underwent unilateral TKA. The simultaneous bilateral TKA patients had longer surgery, were more commonly performed under general anesthesia, had a higher rate of postoperative transfusion, and a greater proportion of patients discharged to rehabilitation facilities. Simultaneous bilateral TKA has a low incidence of major complications and was not associated with more readmissions as compared to unilateral TKA (3.6% versus 3.5% respectively). Nonetheless, the odds of major complications was slightly higher following simultaneous bilateral TKA (OR=1.58).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Hart, Adam","Antoniou, John","Brin, Yaron S","Huk, Olga L","Zukor, David J","Bergeron, Stephane G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arth.2015.07.031","endpage":"35","first_seen_on":"2015-08-25T10:10:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8406","08835403"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Journal of Arthroplasty","last_mentioned_on":1473761235,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26297691?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26297691?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26297691","pubdate":"2015-08-25T22:01:55+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"31","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Simultaneous Bilateral Versus Unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Comparison of 30-Day Readmission Rates and Major Complications.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simultaneous-bilateral-versus-unilateral-total-knee-arthroplasty-comparison-30day-readmission-rates-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":7237777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233179,"mean":9.0345972261535,"rank":193545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233179,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1453,"mean":5.0006336088154,"rank":1302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1453,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.9868421052632,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":4,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/636118451170312192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4431115],"posted_on":"2015-08-25T10:10:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
