Our previous microRNA array data indicated that the miRNA let-7g level increases significantly during porcine ovary follicular atresia. It is uncertain if GCs apoptosis is mediated by microRNA let-7g. In this study, the expression levels of the apoptosis-associated genes CASP3, BAX and BIM were significantly upregulated when let-7g mimic was transfected into porcine GCs, and the anti-apoptotic genes BCL-2 and MCL-1 were significantly downregulated. The apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometry, and our results indicated that let-7g significantly enhanced GCs apoptosis. In further studies, we found that overexpression of let-7g induced the expression of FoxO1 in GCs and led to nuclear accumulation of dephosphorylated FoxO1. In addition, the effect of let-7g on FoxO1 expression and dephosphorylation resulted from repression of the expression of the MAP3K1 gene in porcine GCs. The site on MAP3K1 mRNA targeted by let-7g was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. The anti-apoptotic effect of MAP3K1 was validated by silencing MAP3K1 using small interfering RNA technology. In conclusion, our data indicate that let-7g induces porcine GCs apoptosis by inhibiting the MAP3K1 gene, which promotes FoxO1 expression and dephosphorylation with nuclear accumulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b26","authors":["Rui, Cao","Wangjun, Wu","Xiaolong, Zhou","Kaiqing, Liu","Bojiang, Li","Xianju, Huang","Zhang, Yu","Honglin, Liu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biocel.2015.08.011","first_seen_on":"2015-08-26T03:13:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-5875"],"journal":"International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1440558817,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26299328?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26299328","pubdate":"2015-08-26T22:02:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Let-7g Induces Granulosa Cell Apoptosis by Targeting MAP3K1 in the Porcine Ovary.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/let7g-induces-granulosa-cell-apoptosis-targeting-map3k1-porcine-ovary"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5552203,"mean":6.3814284159698,"rank":4623210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5552203,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193969,"mean":9.375058793203,"rank":155385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193969,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":992,"mean":3.3703632694248,"rank":798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":992,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.84473684210526,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
