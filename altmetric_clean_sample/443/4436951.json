Open surgical repair is a standard procedure and commonly involves ureteroneocystostomy.\nWe retrospectively reviewed data of 9 patients, who underwent laparoscopic extravesical Lich-Gregoir ureteroneocystostomy using the psoas hitch procedure for ureterovaginal fistulas following hysterectomy during the period December 2012-August 2014. Transperitoneal laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy was performed in all cases.\nThe mean operative time was 212 min (range 170-310) and estimated blood loss was 108 ml (range 70-150). Average hospital stay was 5.7 days. Follow-up time was from 6 to 26 months. Postoperative intravenous urography was done after 3 months, which showed patent anastomosis in 8 patients except for 1 patient who had nonvisualization of the ipsilateral renal moiety. Voiding cystogram done at 3 months showed no leakage in all patients. In the postoperative period, 1 patient had recurrent ipsilateral pyelonephritis 2 weeks after surgery, while another patient had febrile UTI. Apart from these no major complications were observed.\nLaparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy with psoas hitch can be performed safely with a success rate compared to that of open surgery but with less morbidity and quick convalescence. \u00a9 2015 S.
