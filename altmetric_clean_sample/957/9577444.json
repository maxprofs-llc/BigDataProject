In Europe, this species is rare, and there is not much information about its range (Falt\u00fdnkov\u00e1 et al. 2007; Sold\u00e1nov\u00e1 et al. 2012). Australapatemon burti has a complex life cycle with three larval stages, two of which (sporocyst and cercaria) use several species of freshwater snails, and the third stage (metacercaria) use non-specific host hirudineans (Dubois 1968; Davies & Ostrowski de N\u00fa\u00f1ez 2012; Blasco-Costa et al. 2016). Adult flukes are parasitic in the intenstines of various waterfowl species, such as ducks and swans (Drago et al. 2007; Hern\u00e1ndez-Mena et al. 2014). Currently, the molecular data on this parasite species includes only nucleotide sequences of four adult specimens from Mexico (Hern\u00e1ndez-Mena et al. 2014). Their hosts were Mexican duck, Anas diazi Ridgway, American Wigeon, Anas americana Gmelin, Cinnamon Teal, Anas cyanoptera Vieillot, and Ruddy Duck, Oxyura jamaicensis (Gmelin) (Anserformes: Anatidae).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008daf","authors":["Aksenova, Olga V","Bespalaya, Yulia V","Bolotov, Ivan N","Kondakov, Alexander V","Sokolova, Svetlana E"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-11T12:48:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1175-5334"],"issue":"4","journal":"ZOOTAXA","last_mentioned_on":1468241290,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27395696?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27395696","pubdate":"2016-07-11T22:00:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"First molecular identification of Australapatemon burti (Miller, 1923) (Trematoda: Digenea: Strigeidae) from an intermediate host Radix labiata (Rossmaessler) (Gastropoda: Lymnaeidae) in Europe.","type":"article","volume":"4132"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063512,"mean":6.842512696265,"rank":6982208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063512,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258996,"mean":11.661262649858,"rank":217995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258996,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5675,"mean":3.2971991540359,"rank":5256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5675,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":360,"mean":3.3590974930362,"rank":301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":360,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/statuses\/752484627034492929","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9577444],"posted_on":"2016-07-11T12:48:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
