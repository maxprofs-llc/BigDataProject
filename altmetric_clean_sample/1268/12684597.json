Understanding these relationships is essential for addressing residential self-selection bias.\nUsing 25\u2005years (6 examinations) of data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (n=11\u2005013 observations) and linked neighbourhood-level data from the 4 CARDIA baseline cities (Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Oakland, California, USA), we characterised participants' neighbourhoods as having low, average or high road connectivity and amenities using non-hierarchical cluster analysis. We then used repeated measures multinomial logistic regression with random effects to examine the associations between individual-level sociodemographics and neighbourhood-level characteristics with residential neighbourhood types over the 25-year period, and whether these associations differed by individual-level income.\nBeing female was positively associated with living in neighbourhoods with low (vs high) road connectivity and activity-related and diet-related amenities among high-income individuals only. At all income levels, a higher percentage of neighbourhood white population and neighbourhood population <18\u2005years were associated with living in neighbourhoods with low (vs high) connectivity and amenities. Individual-level race; age; and educational attainment, neighbourhood socioeconomic status and housing prices did not influence residential location behaviour related to neighbourhood connectivity and amenities at any income level.\nNeighbourhood-level factors appeared to play a comparatively greater role in shaping residential location behaviour than individual-level sociodemographics. Our study is an important step in understanding how residential locational behaviour relates to amenities and physical activity opportunities, and may help mitigate residential self-selection bias in built environment studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8083cf058f61000ba9f","authors":["Pasquale E Rummo","David K Guilkey","James M Shikany","Jared P Reis","Penny Gordon-Larsen"],"doi":"10.1136\/jech-2016-207249","first_seen_on":"2016-10-17T17:03:44+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1470-2738","0143-005X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (1978)","last_mentioned_on":1487511953,"links":["http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/22\/jech-2016-207249.full","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/22\/jech-2016-207249.short?g=w_jech_ahead_tab","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/71\/3\/261"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/22\/jech-2016-207249.full.pdf","pmid":"27660400","pubdate":"2016-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Geography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"jech-2016-207249","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices","epidemiology"],"title":"How do individual-level sociodemographics and neighbourhood-level characteristics influence residential location behaviour in the context of the food and built environment?
