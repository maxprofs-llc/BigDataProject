Before surgery, most birds were more accurate on tests of memory for location than on tests of memory for color. Damage to the hippocampal complex caused a decline in memory for location, whereas memory for color was not affected in the same birds. This dissociation indicates that the avian hippocampus plays an important role in spatial cognition and suggests that this brain structure may play no role in working memory generally.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023a7","authors":["Hampton, R R","Shettleworth, S J"],"first_seen_on":"2016-10-17T15:34:16+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0735-7044"],"issue":"4","journal":"Behavioral Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1413376800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8864273"],"pmid":"8864273","pubdate":"1996-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","neurology"],"title":"Hippocampal lesions impair memory for location but not color in passerine birds.","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hippocampal-lesions-impair-memory-location-not-color-passerine-birds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":27.192,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":27.192},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8012961,"mean":6.7696029684366,"rank":302291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7710841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8012961,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244010,"mean":12.637175284518,"rank":18199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":225811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244010,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2858,"mean":1.8210087504375,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":2843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2858,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
