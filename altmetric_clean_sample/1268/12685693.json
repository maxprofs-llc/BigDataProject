In Kenya's coastal region, the prevalence among pre-school age children (PSAC) ranges from 27.8 to 66.7\u00a0%. Whereas some pre-schools are as far as 7 km from the nearest primary schools, the National School-Based Deworming Programme (NSBDP) requires the pre-school teachers to walk with the children to primary schools for deworming by trained primary school teachers. The long distances may contribute in making drug delivery ineffective and unsustainable.\nTo assess the pre-school teachers' knowledge, experiences and perceptions of STH and the NSBDP, a cross-sectional study using qualitative methods was conducted in four sub-counties of the Coast Region. Through purposive sampling, 41 pre-schools which are 2 or more kilometers away from a primary school were selected and in-depth interviews administered to the teachers. Separate in-depth interviews were administered to 34 community health extension workers, 40 opinion leaders and 38 primary school teachers all purposively selected to assess their perceptions of the role of pre-school teachers in the NSBDP. Data was audio recorded, transcribed, coded and analyzed manually by study themes.\nA third of the pre-school teachers were aware of signs of STHs and a half indicated that poor hygiene and sanitation practices are major causes. A majority of the pre-school teachers reported that health education and environmental sanitation are key control methods. Majority (39) had received information on NSBDP from various sources and all took part in community sensitization and in treating the pre-school children. A large majority of all study participants indicated that treating the children at pre-schools is ideal for increased coverage. Majority of the pre-school teachers perceived the NSBDP as important in improving the health status of the children. All study participants felt that the parents needed to be given adequate information on STHs and training the pre-school teachers to assist in community sensitization and drug administration would be useful.\nPre-school teachers are a potential resource to the NSBDP that should be utilized to instill proper water and sanitation practices to the young children and assist in community sensitization. They should be empowered and allowed to administer treatment for STH control. County Governments, their current employers should find ways of engaging them in worm control efforts.\nKEMRI SSC 2547, Registered 22 July 2013.","altmetric_jid":"54e7893b2a83ee46118b459a","authors":["D.
