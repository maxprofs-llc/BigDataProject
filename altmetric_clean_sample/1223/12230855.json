Immunofluorescent (IF) IHC staining was performed to demonstrate expression of GFAP, SOX2, PRR, ACE, ATIIR1, and ATIIR2. The protein expression and the transcriptional activities of the genes encoding for ACE, PRR, ATIIR1, and ATIIR2 were studied using Western blotting (WB) and NanoString gene expression analysis, respectively.\nDAB and IF IHC staining demonstrated the expression SOX2 on the GFAP+\u2009GBM CSCs. Cytoplasmic expression of PRR by the GFAP+\u2009CSCs and the endothelium of the microvessels was observed. ACE was expressed on the endothelium of the microvessels only, while nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of ATIIR1 and ATIIR2 was observed on the endothelium of the microvessels and the CSCs. ATIIR1 was expressed on the GFAP+\u2009CSCs cells, and ATIIR2 was expressed by the SOX2+\u2009CSCs. The expression of ACE, PRR, and ATIIR1, but not ATIIR2, was confirmed by WB. NanoString gene analysis demonstrated transcriptional activation of ACE, PRR, and ATIIR1, but not ATIIR2.\nThis study demonstrated the expression of PRR, ATIIR1, and ATIIR2 by the SOX2 CSC population, and ACE on the endothelium of the microvessels, within GBM. ACE, PRR, and ATIIR1 were expressed at the protein and mRNA levels, with ATIIR2 detectable only by IHC staining. This novel finding suggests that the CSCs may be a novel therapeutic target for GBM by modulation of the RAS.","altmetric_jid":"565496cd2a83ee7c2d8b458c","authors":["Bradshaw, Amy Ruth","Wickremesekera, Agadha Crisantha","Brasch, Helen D.","Chibnall, Alice M.","Davis, Paul F.","Tan, Swee T.","Itinteang, Tinte"],"doi":"10.3389\/fsurg.2016.00051","first_seen_on":"2016-09-27T03:26:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2296-875X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1479412323,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fsurg.2016.00051\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fsurg.2016.00051\/full?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fsurg.2016.00051\/pdf","pmid":"27730123","pubdate":"2016-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Glioblastoma Multiforme Cancer Stem Cells Express Components of the Renin\u2013Angiotensin System","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glioblastoma-multiforme-cancer-stem-cells-express-components-reninangiotensin-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7705958,"mean":6.6115526533506,"rank":5827271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1039668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7705958,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244232,"mean":12.456481797969,"rank":171747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244232,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205,"mean":1.3208333333333,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.4954545454545,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontSurgery\/statuses\/780609422762455040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12230855],"posted_on":"2016-09-27T03:26:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers in Surgery","url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533297738960478209\/lMu-V8Yw_normal.jpeg","description":"The official Twitter Feed for all the latest peer-reviewed articles appearing in the upcoming journal Frontiers in Surgery.","id_on_source":"FrontSurgery","tweeter_id":"2373752904","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":134},"tweet_id":"780609422762455040"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontSurgery\/statuses\/799339335078162434","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12230855],"posted_on":"2016-11-17T19:52:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers in Surgery","url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533297738960478209\/lMu-V8Yw_normal.jpeg","description":"The official Twitter Feed for all the latest peer-reviewed articles appearing in the upcoming journal Frontiers in Surgery.","id_on_source":"FrontSurgery","tweeter_id":"2373752904","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":134},"tweet_id":"799339335078162434"}]}}
