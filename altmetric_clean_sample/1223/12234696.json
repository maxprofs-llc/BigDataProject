Complex 1\u00b75MeOH was isolated by the reaction of NiCl2\u00b76H2O, pyaoxH2 and NaOMe in a 1\u2009:\u20091\u2009:\u20092 molar ratio in MeOH in 60% yield. Treatment of NiSO4\u00b76H2O with pyaoxH2 and NEt3 in a 1\u2009:\u20091\u2009:\u20092 molar ratio in MeOH afforded 2\u00b710H2O\u00b726MeOH in good yield (65%). The two compounds display a multi-decker configuration based on stacked Ni4 layers, {Ni4(pyaox)2(pyaoxH)2}(2+)x (x = 3, 1\u00b75MeOH; x = 4, 2\u00b710H2O\u00b726MeOH); each deck consists of two square planar and two octahedral Ni(II) centres. The number of decks observed in 1\u00b75MeOH and 2\u00b710H2O\u00b726MeOH depends on the nature of the inorganic anion that is present in the reaction system, which provides elements of synthetic control towards new high nuclearity Ni(II) species. 2\u00b710H2O\u00b726MeOH is the first structurally characterized complex of any metal displaying a quadruple-decker configuration, being also the highest nuclearity metal cluster bearing pyaoxH2 and the highest nuclearity Ni(II) cluster with any type of 2-pyridyl oxime. Each cluster cation displays ferromagnetic exchange between the octahedral Ni(II) ions resulting in a spin ground state of S = 6 for 1 and S = 8 for 2. Magnetothermal studies have been performed and discussed for both clusters.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Constantinos Efthymiou","Luis Cunha-Silva","Spyros P Perlepes","Euan K Brechin","Ross Inglis","Marco Evangelisti","Constantina Papatriantafyllopoulou","Efthymiou, Constantinos G","Cunha-Silva, Lu\u00eds","Perlepes, Spyros P","Brechin, Euan K","Inglis, Ross","Evangelisti, Marco","Papatriantafyllopoulou, Constantina","Constantinos G.
