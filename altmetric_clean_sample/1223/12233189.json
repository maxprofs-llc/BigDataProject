However, these children face an increased risk of late death and incident cancers after HSCT, which may occur many years after their initial HSCT.\nWe examined cancer occurrence and late mortality in a population-based cohort of 318 Australian children who underwent allogeneic HSCT for non-malignant disease. Standardized incident ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and compared with population controls.\nWe identified six (1.9%) cancers at a median 9.2 years post-HSCT. Cancer occurred 15 times more frequently than in the general population (SIR 15.4, 95% CI = 6.9-34.2). Of the 198 patients who survived for at least 2 years post-HSCT, 11 (5.6%) died at a median 7.5 years post-HSCT. The mortality rate was 17 times higher than in the general population (SMR 17.5, 95% CI = 9.7-31.2).\nChildren transplanted for non-malignant conditions require evidence-based survivorship programs to reduce excess morbidity and mortality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008482","authors":["Nelson, Adam S.","Vajdic, Claire M.","Ashton, Lesley J.","Marsney, Renate E.","Nivison\u2010Smith, Ian","Wilcox, Leonie","Dodds, Anthony J.","O'Brien, Tracey A.","Nelson, Adam S","Vajdic, Claire M","Ashton, Lesley J","Le Marsney, Renate E","Nivison-Smith, Ian","Dodds, Anthony J","O'Brien, Tracey A",", ","Adam S.
