The pAl\/C-graphite DIB demonstrates superior cycling stability and high rate performance, achieving a highly reversible capacity of 93 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 2 C over the voltage range of 3.0-4.95 V. In addition, the DIB could achieve an energy density of \u2248204 Wh kg(-1) at a high power density of 3084 W kg(-1) .","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Tong, Xuefeng","Zhang, Fan","Ji, Bifa","Sheng, Maohua","Tang, Yongbing"],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201603735","endpage":"9985","first_seen_on":"2016-10-09T03:25:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-4095"],"issue":"45","journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1476264614,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201603735\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/adma.201603735"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201603735\/pdf","pmid":"27678136","pubdate":"2016-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"9979","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Carbon-Coated Porous Aluminum Foil Anode for High-Rate, Long-Term Cycling Stability, and High Energy Density Dual-Ion Batteries.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carboncoated-porous-aluminum-foil-anode-highrate-longterm-cycling-stability-high-energy-density-dual"},"altmetric_score":{"score":31,"score_history":{"1y":31,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":31},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7529066,"mean":6.5069445313556,"rank":240647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7287367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7529066,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240658,"mean":12.512973651296,"rank":16008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":224587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240658,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4109,"mean":10.405455209348,"rank":304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":3800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4109,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":22.569045454545,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
