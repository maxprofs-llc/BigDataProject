In this paper, drugs considered are tobacco and alcohol, which are legal, plus those that are illegal. The social cost is the sum of the external cost: value of loss in quality of life, value of years of life lost and value of loss in productivity, plus public expenditure. Public expenditure consists of public spending on medical care, prevention, and law enforcement, minus savings from unpaid pensions and taxes levied on tobacco and alcohol. The parameters for the calculations have used the recommendations of a French governmental working group (2013) Quinet, L'\u00e9valuation socio\u00e9conomique des investissements publics [Internet], Centre d'Analyse Strat\u00e9gique, 2013, http:\/\/www.strategie.gouv.fr\/sites\/strategie.gouv.fr\/files\/archives\/CGSP_Evaluation_socioeconomique_17092013.pdf , and the health data were derived from the scientific literature. The social costs are \u20ac122 billion for tobacco, \u20ac118 billion for alcohol, and \u20ac8.7 billion for illegal drugs. The largest fraction of the costs (53, 56, and 31\u00a0%, respectively) derives from the number of deaths, 79,000 for tobacco, 49,000 for alcohol, and 1600 for illegal drugs, given the high cost of a year of life lost (\u20ac115,000). The external cost corresponds to 86, 97, and 68\u00a0% of the social cost, respectively, for tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs. The annual drug-related net expenditure represents \u20ac13.9, \u20ac3.0, and \u20ac2.3 billion, respectively, for tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs. The tax revenues on tobacco and alcohol, \u20ac10.4 and \u20ac3.2 billion, represent less than half of the corresponding healthcare costs, which are \u20ac25.9 and \u20ac7.7 billion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000734e","authors":["Pierre Kopp","Marysia Ogrodnik"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10198-016-0835-9","first_seen_on":"2016-10-09T08:19:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1618-7601","1618-7598"],"journal":"The European Journal of Health Economics","last_mentioned_on":1504287870,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10198-016-0835-9","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10198-016-0835-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10198-016-0835-9.pdf","pmid":"27722965","pubdate":"2016-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"The social cost of drugs in France in 2010","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/social-cost-drugs-france-2010"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":3898919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4473311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253818,"mean":12.787285839798,"rank":113672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":136149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253818,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":632,"mean":3.6967004754358,"rank":331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":632,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":2.6039259259259,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
