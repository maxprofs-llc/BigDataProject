To achieve this, methods have been developed to determine ABP continuously and noninvasively, including the wrist volume clamp method, which uses reflection-mode photoplethysmography (PPG) to indicate the volume change of the radial artery. However, this kind of indication is reportedly not accurate enough, and an in-vivo test for its accuracy is still lacking. Our aim was to fix this gap.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005780","doi":"10.1097\/mbp.0b013e328338aada","first_seen_on":"2013-03-07T18:43:42+00:00","issns":["1359-5237"],"issue":"4","journal":"Blood pressure monitoring.","last_mentioned_on":1362681795,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/Abstract\/2010\/08000\/Comparison_between_reflection_mode.7.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/2010\/08000\/Comparison_between_reflection_mode.7.pdf","pmid":"20410816","pubdate":"2010-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"213","title":"Comparison between reflection-mode photoplethysmography and arterial diameter change detected by ultrasound at the region of radial artery","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-between-reflectionmode-photoplethysmography-arterial-diameter-change-detected-ultrasound"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":959907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89204,"mean":6.4315447910945,"rank":60143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89204,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":440,"mean":1.5383097949886,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":440,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":3.0448235294118,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
