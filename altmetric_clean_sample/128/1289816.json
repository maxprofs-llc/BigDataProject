Upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties are the main concerns related to the pathology. Mandibular distraction should be considered a treatment option (when other treatments result inadequate). PATIANTS AND METHODS: Ten patients between the ages of 1 month and 2 years with severe micrognathia and airway obstruction were treated with Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis (MDO).All patients underwent fibroscopic examination of the upper airway and a radiographic imaging and\/or computed tomography scans to detect malformations and to confirm that the obstruction was caused by posterior tongue displacement. All patients were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team. Indications for surgery included frequent apneic episodes with severe desaturation (70%). Gavage therapy was employed in all patients since oral feeding was not possible. The two tracheotomy patients were 5 months and 2 years old respectively, and the distraction procedure was performed to remove the tracheotomy tube. All patients were treated with bilateral mandibular distraction: two cases with an external multivector distraction device, six cases with an internal non-resorbable device and two cases with an internal resorbable device. In one case, the patient with Goldenhar's Syndrome, the procedure was repeated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000842","authors":["Enrico Sesenna","Alice S Magri","Cinzia Magnani","Bruno C Brevi","Marilena L Anghinoni"],"doi":"10.1186\/1824-7288-38-7","first_seen_on":"2013-03-08T16:45:48+00:00","issns":["","1824-7288"],"issue":"1","journal":"Italian Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1460219085,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3293018\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22300418"],"pmid":"22300418","pubdate":"2013-03-08T20:12:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Maternal and Child Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"7","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Mandibular distraction in neonates: indications, technique, results","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mandibular-distraction-neonates-indications-technique-results-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7549515,"mean":6.5193893506218,"rank":1803555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":5728463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7549515,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114909,"mean":6.4533411772897,"rank":29122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":85429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114909,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333,"mean":2.8254759036145,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.2055555555556,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
