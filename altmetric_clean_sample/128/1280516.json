The metal moieties in these three compounds are Re(CO)3(tert-Bu2 bpy)(C\u2261C), Au(PPh3)(C\u2261C), and trans-Pt(PPh3)2(C\u2261C)2, respectively, which are connected to the ppy chelate through the alkyne linker. Our investigation has established that the Re(I) unit completely quenches the photoisomerization of the boron unit because of a low-lying intraligand charge transfer\/MLCT triplet state. The Au(I) unit, albeit with a triplet energy that is much higher than that of B(ppy)Mes2 , upon conjugation with the ppy chelate unit, substantially increases the contribution of the \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* transition, localized on the conjugated chelate backbone in the lowest triplet state, thereby leading to a decrease in the photoisomerization quantum efficiency (QE) of the boron chromophore when excited at 365\u2005nm. At higher excitation energies, the photoisomerization QE of Au-B is comparable to that of the silyl-alkyne-functionalized B(ppy)Mes2 (TIPS-B), which was attributable to a triplet-state-sensitization effect by the Au(I) unit. The Pt(II) unit links two B(ppy)Mes2 together in Pt-B, thereby extending the \u03c0-conjugation through both chelate backbones and leading to a very low QE of the photoisomerization. In addition, only one boron unit in Pt-B undergoes photoisomerization. The isomerization of the second boron unit is quenched by an intramolecular energy transfer of the excitation energy to the low-energy absorption band of the isomerized boron unit. TD-DFT computations and spectroscopic studies of the three metal-containing boron compounds confirm that the photoisomerization of the B(ppy)Mes2 chromophore proceeds through a triplet photoactive state and that metal units with suitable triplet energies can be used to tune this system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Wang, Nan","Ko, Soo\u2010Byung","Lu, Jia\u2010Sheng","Chen, Leanne D.","Wang, Suning"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201204048","endpage":"5323","first_seen_on":"2013-03-05T16:32:46+00:00","issns":["1521-3765","0947-6539"],"issue":"17","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1362501152,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201204048\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201204048\/pdf","pmid":"23460416","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"5314","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Tuning the Photoisomerization of a N^C\u00e2\u0080\u0090Chelate Organoboron Compound with a Metal\u00ef\u00a3\u00bfAcetylide Unit","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tuning-photoisomerization-ncchelate-organoboron-compound-metalacetylide-unit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632209,"mean":4.9245852853192,"rank":2015260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":944995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632209,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85509,"mean":6.1485806942042,"rank":43239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":27368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85509,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2132,"mean":2.9398207414359,"rank":985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2132,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":5.9674074074074,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
