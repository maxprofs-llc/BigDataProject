More specifically, in diseases caused by parasites, immunosuppression frequently prevents immunopathology that can injure the host. However, this allows a small number of parasites to evade the immune response and remain in the host after a clinical cure. The consequences can be chronic infections, which establish a zoonotic or anthroponotic reservoir. This review will highlight some of the identified regulatory mechanisms of the immune system that govern immune responses to parasitic diseases, in particular leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis and malaria, and discuss implications for the development of efficient vaccines against these diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b0f","authors":["Jessica C.
