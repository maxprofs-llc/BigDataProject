A case report by Kara Krajewski and Jan Regelsberger.Objective. To demonstrate a case of intradural lumbar disc herniation including imaging studies, intraoperative imaging and an intraoperative video.Summary of Background Data. The first case of lumbar intradural disc herniation was reported as early as 1942; since then over 150 cases have been reported, mostly in the lumbar spine. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is considered the gold standard for diagnosing this entity, though it is rarely peformed routinely in lumbar disc disease and diagnosis is often made intraoperatively.Methods. A 70-year-old man presented to the emergency department as a referral complaining of lower back pain, loss of sensation in the right thigh and difficulty walking. On examination, he showed uneven gait, right-sided foot drop (1\/5), hypesthesias in the right inguinal area and ventral thigh and a positive straight leg raise test on the right. Anal sphincter tone was within normal limits. An MRI of the lumbar spine showed a large mediolateral herniated disc at L3\/4, with caudal displacement and unclear signal changes intradurally.Results. Intraoperatively, the herniated disc was found upon opening the dural sac.Conclusion. Intradural disc herniations are a rare entity. The opening and inspection of the dural sack should be considered when the correct spinal level can be confirmed and insufficient herniated disc material can be visualized extradurally.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","doi":"10.1097\/brs.0b013e31828daa8c","first_seen_on":"2013-03-06T12:42:11+00:00","issns":["0362-2436"],"issue":"","journal":"Spine","last_mentioned_on":1370066492,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Intradural_Lumbar_Disc_Herniation_Associated_With.97844.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/9000\/00000\/Intradural_Lumbar_Disc_Herniation_Associated_With.97844.pdf","pmid":"23462573","pubdate":"2013-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Intradural Lumbar Disc Herniation Associated With Degenerative Spine Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intradural-lumbar-disc-herniation-associated-degenerative-spine-disease-rheumatoid-arthritis-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2932375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1429761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89211,"mean":6.4507560138999,"rank":56206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":29528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89211,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3498,"mean":4.3859473834715,"rank":2094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3498,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":4.4834179104478,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SpineWebJournal\/statuses\/309282687582097408","license":"public","citation_ids":[1283507],"posted_on":"2013-03-06T12:41:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Spine","url":"http:\/\/spinejournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/761237931545677824\/JkWpUkYc_normal.jpg","description":"Spine is an international, peer-reviewed, bi-weekly periodical that considers for publication original articles in the field of spine.","id_on_source":"SpineWebJournal","tweeter_id":"314148293","geo":{"lt":39.95234,"ln":-75.16379,"country":"US"},"followers":2083},"tweet_id":"309282687582097408"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cabinet_de_kine\/statuses\/335437665216389120","license":"public","citation_ids":[1283507],"posted_on":"2013-05-17T16:52:26+00:00","author":{"name":"osteo-du-sport.fr","url":"https:\/\/www.osteo-du-sport.fr","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/770393772756725760\/t7Xqze3a_normal.jpg","description":"https:\/\/goo.gl\/hkyczU Ost\u00e9opathe D.O. - Master en Kin\u00e9sith\u00e9rapie - Ancien cadre Industrie Pharma - Tech Sup d'analyses biom\u00e9dic Serv. de sant\u00e9 des arm\u00e9es, IGR","id_on_source":"cabinet_de_kine","tweeter_id":"813288422","geo":{"lt":48.56903,"ln":2.44384,"country":"FR"},"followers":1096},"tweet_id":"335437665216389120"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SpineWebJournal\/statuses\/340709678260580352","license":"public","citation_ids":[1283507],"posted_on":"2013-06-01T06:01:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Spine","url":"http:\/\/spinejournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/761237931545677824\/JkWpUkYc_normal.jpg","description":"Spine is an international, peer-reviewed, bi-weekly periodical that considers for publication original articles in the field of spine.","id_on_source":"SpineWebJournal","tweeter_id":"314148293","geo":{"lt":39.95234,"ln":-75.16379,"country":"US"},"followers":2083},"tweet_id":"340709678260580352"}]}}
