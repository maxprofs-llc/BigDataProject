Kelly Scanlon of GW EOH on use of WE-DALY in new LCA characterization factor. #remembertheworker #SEEDpubs"],"citation":{"abstract":"Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a systems-based method used to determine potential impacts to the environment associated with a product throughout its life cycle. Conclusions from LCA studies can be applied to support decisions regarding product design or public policy, therefore, all relevant inputs (e.g., raw materials, energy) and outputs (e.g., emissions, waste) to the product system should be evaluated to estimate impacts. Currently, work-related impacts are not routinely considered in LCA. The objectives of this paper are: 1) introduce the work environment disability-adjusted life year (WE-DALY), one portion of a characterization factor used to express the magnitude of impacts to human health attributable to work-related exposures to workplace hazards; 2) outline the methods for calculating the WE-DALY; 3) demonstrate the calculation; and 4) highlight strengths and weaknesses of the methodological approach.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cd3cf058f610000558","doi":"10.1186\/1476-069x-12-21","first_seen_on":"2013-03-07T07:25:37+00:00","issns":["1476-069X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source","last_mentioned_on":1362667763,"links":["http:\/\/www.ehjournal.net\/content\/12\/1\/21\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ehjournal.net\/content\/pdf\/1476-069X-12-21.pdf","pmid":"23497039","pubdate":"2013-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"21","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"The work environment disability-adjusted life year for use with life cycle assessment: a methodological approach","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/work-environment-disabilityadjusted-life-year-life-cycle-assessment-methodological-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":1120218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3905905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93254,"mean":6.6497423782614,"rank":22021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":71010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93254,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":620,"mean":11.17444911147,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":620,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":4.7362962962963,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
