Venous Doppler sonography of the extremities is a commonly performed procedure to evaluate for the presence of deep venous thrombosis. Pulsed-wave Doppler sonography is performed as part of this procedure to evaluate for the presence of cardiac pulsatility or respiratory phasicity. The importance of information provided by the pulsed-wave Doppler waveform must not be undervalued. Thus, the purpose of this article is to discuss the pathology of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis that can be discovered by identifying abnormal waveforms in the veins of the extremities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698d","authors":["James E.
