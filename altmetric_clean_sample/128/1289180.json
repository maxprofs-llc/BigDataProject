Targeted therapy with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may cause significant reduction of tumor volume, thereby enabling radical surgery. This treatment strategy, therefore, offers a chance of cure for selected patients with advanced dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. In addition, preoperative treatment with imatinib may decrease possible disfigurement related to radical surgery for large tumors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b8","doi":"10.1186\/1477-7819-11-59","first_seen_on":"2013-03-08T12:21:38+00:00","issns":["1477-7819"],"issue":"1","journal":"World Journal of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1417151214,"links":["http:\/\/www.wjso.com\/content\/11\/1\/59\/abstract","http:\/\/www.wjso.com\/content\/11\/1\/59"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.wjso.com\/content\/pdf\/1477-7819-11-59.pdf","pmid":"23496933","pubdate":"2013-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"59","subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"Complete resection of recurrent and initially unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans downsized by Imatinib","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-resection-recurrent-initially-unresectable-dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-downsized-imatin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4559875,"mean":5.3532196658184,"rank":2145928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2369565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4559875,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89551,"mean":6.612187627024,"rank":38906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":49445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89551,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1051,"mean":1.22928,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1051,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":1.4198082191781,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
