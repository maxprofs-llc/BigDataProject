The second aim was to investigate whether the intervention led to changes in fruit and vegetable intake that was not targeted in the intervention. Finally, it was tested whether changes in exercise habit strength may explain such a transfer effect.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003383","authors":["Fleig L","Lippke S","Pomp S","Schwarzer R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ypmed.2011.06.019","first_seen_on":"2013-03-07T22:59:34+00:00","issns":["0091-7435","00917435"],"issue":"3","journal":"Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1362697151,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0091743511002453"],"pmid":"21784096","pubdate":"2011-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Intervention effects of exercise self-regulation on physical exercise and eating fruits and vegetables: a longitudinal study in orthopedic and cardiac rehabilitation.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intervention-effects-exercise-selfregulation-physical-exercise-eating-fruits-vegetables-longitudinal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628302,"mean":4.942517914036,"rank":2017441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628302,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85537,"mean":6.1790980639732,"rank":43399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":27179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85537,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":965,"mean":7.3318651452282,"rank":640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":965,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":7.2010666666667,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
