Both reduced and oxidized forms of cytochromes b and c (cyt b and cyt c) have been observed in situ without any pretreatment. The redox states of cyts b and c have been assessed quantitatively with a spectral analysis. It has been found that reduced cyt c is more abundant than oxidized cyt c, while oxidized cyt b is slightly more abundant than reduced cyt b in a living cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007ba3","authors":["Kakita, Minoru","Okuno, Masanari","Hamaguchi, Hiro\u2010o"],"doi":"10.1002\/jbio.201200042","endpage":"259","first_seen_on":"2013-03-06T10:48:37+00:00","issns":["1864-0648","1864-063X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Biophotonics","last_mentioned_on":1362542290,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/jbio.201200042&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbio.201200042\/pdf","pmid":"22573518","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"256","subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Quantitative analysis of the redox states of cytochromes in a living L929 (NCTC) cell by resonance Raman microspectroscopy","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-analysis-redox-states-cytochromes-living-l929-nctc-cell-resonance-raman-microspectrosco"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6710513,"mean":6.1614211824654,"rank":5732016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6710513,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111582,"mean":6.2936877783853,"rank":88513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111582,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":702,"mean":2.9945335235378,"rank":551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":702,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.8145,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
