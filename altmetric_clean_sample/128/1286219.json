We have fabricated superlattices of the paramagnetic metal lanthanum nickelate (LaNiO(3)) and the wide-gap insulator lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO(3)) with atomically precise layer sequences. We used optical ellipsometry and low-energy muon spin rotation to show that superlattices with LaNiO(3) as thin as two unit cells undergo a sequence of collective metal-insulator and antiferromagnetic transitions as a function of decreasing temperature, whereas samples with thicker LaNiO(3) layers remain metallic and paramagnetic at all temperatures. Metal-oxide superlattices thus allow control of the dimensionality and collective phase behavior of correlated-electron systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011Sci...332..937B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","arxiv_id":"1111.3819","authors":["A.
