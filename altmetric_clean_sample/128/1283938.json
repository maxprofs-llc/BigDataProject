The increase of distracted driving behavior (DDB) has resulted in an increase in injury and death. The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency and perception of DDB in adults. A 7-question SurveyMonkey questionnaire was distributed to a convenience sample of adults. Standard demographics included age, gender, and highest levels of education. Primary outcome questions were related to frequency of DDB, and overall perceptions specific to distracted driving. Results were compared on the basis of demographics. Chi-square testing and the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance were applied, with statistical significance defined as P \u2264 .05. There were 1857 respondents to the survey: 1721 were aged 23-64 years (93%); 1511 were women (81%); 1461 had high school education or greater (79%). A total of 168 respondents (9%) reported being involved in a car accident while distracted. The highest reported frequency of DDB included cell phone use (69%), eating\/drinking (67%), and reaching for an object in the care (49%). Younger age (18-34 years) and higher level of education (bachelor's degree or greater) were statistically associated with these DDB; gender demonstrated no statistical significance. Text messaging was reported by 538 respondents (29%), with a statistically significant association with age (18-34 years), higher education (bachelor's degree or greater), and gender (males). A total of 1143 respondents (63%) believed that they could drive safely while distracted. This study demonstrates that DDB in adults is not restricted to reading and sending text messages. Moreover, these results indicated that people fail to perceive the dangers inherent in distracted driving. Prevention and outreach education should not be limited to texting and cell phone use but should target all forms of DDB. The age group 18-34 years should be the primary target in the adult population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ad2","doi":"10.1097\/jtn.0b013e318286616c","first_seen_on":"2013-03-06T15:34:34+00:00","issns":["1078-7496"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Trauma Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1387417221,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23459429?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23459429","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Distracted driving and implications for injury prevention in adults.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distracted-driving-implications-injury-prevention-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":1929321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2536819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89212,"mean":6.440430103911,"rank":34112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":54025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89212,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321,"mean":1.08026875,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
