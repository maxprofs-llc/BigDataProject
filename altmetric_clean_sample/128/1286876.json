The family Chlamydiaceae is gaining attention as a common cause of disease in amphibians and may harbour new and emerging amphibian pathogens. We identified a novel species of Chlamydiales (Candidatus Amphibiichlamydia ranarum) with a prevalence of 71% in exotic invasive bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) from an introduced population in the Netherlands. The sequence of a 1474\u2003bp 16S rRNA gene fragment showed that the novel taxon forms a well-defined clade with 'Candidatus Amphibiichlamydia salamandrae' within the Chlamydiaceae family. Although none of the tadpoles examined showed signs of clinical disease, urgent evaluation of its pathogenic potential for native amphibian species is required.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c1d","authors":["Martel A","Adriaensen C","Sharifian-Fard M","Vandewoestyne M","Deforce D","Favoreel H","Bergen K","Spitzen-van der Sluijs A","Devisscher S","Adriaens T","Louette G","Baert K","Hyatt A","Crameri S","Haesebrouck F","Pasmans F","Martel, An","Adriaensen, Connie","Sharifian\u2010Fard, Mojdeh","Vandewoestyne, Mado","Deforce, Dieter","Favoreel, Herman","Bergen, Karolien","Spitzen\u2010van der Sluijs, Annemarieke","Devisscher, Sander","Adriaens, Tim","Louette, Gerald","Baert, Kristof","Hyatt, Alex","Crameri, Sandra","Haesebrouck, Freddy","Pasmans, Frank"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1758-2229.2012.00359.x","endpage":"108","first_seen_on":"2013-03-07T17:16:09+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-3198402","handles":["1854\/LU-3198402"],"issns":["1758-2229","","17582229"],"issue":"1","journal":"Environmental Microbiology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1362676547,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1758-2229.2012.00359.x\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1758-2229.2012.00359.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1758-2229.2012.00359.x\/pdf","pmid":"23757138","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"105","title":"The novel \u00e2\u0080\u0098Candidatus Amphibiichlamydia ranarum\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is highly prevalent in invasive exotic bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus)","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-candidatus-amphibiichlamydia-ranarum-highly-prevalent-invasive-exotic-bullfrogs-lithobates-cat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3077393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":956161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89204,"mean":6.4454768785804,"rank":59686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89204,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304,"mean":2.4737887788779,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
