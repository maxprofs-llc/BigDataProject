To evaluate the role of p11 in peripheral pain pathways, we generated a loxP-flanked (floxed) p11 mouse and used the Cre-loxP recombinase system to delete p11 exclusively from nociceptive primary sensory neurons in mice. p11-null neurons showed deficits in the expression of Na(V)1.8, but not of annexin 2. Damage-sensing primary neurons from these animals show a reduced tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium current density, consistent with a loss of membrane-associated Na(V)1.8. Noxious coding in wide-dynamic-range neurons in the dorsal horn was markedly compromised. Acute pain behavior was attenuated in certain models, but no deficits in inflammatory pain were observed. A significant deficit in neuropathic pain behavior was also apparent in the conditional-null mice. These results confirm an important role for p11 in nociceptor function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Thomas Foulkes","Mohammed A.
