Stimulation of cells by agonists leads to the rapid phosphorylation of IkappaBs leading to their degradation that results in NF-kappaB activation. IKK-1 and IKK-2 are two direct IkappaB kinases. Two recently identified novel IKKs are IKK-i and TBK-1. We have cloned, expressed, and purified to homogeneity recombinant human (rh)IKK-i and rhTBK-1 and compared their enzymatic properties with those of rhIKK-2. We show that rhIKK-i and rhTBK-1 are enzymatically similar to each other. We demonstrate by phosphopeptide mapping and site-specific mutagenesis that rhIKK-i and rhTBK-1 are phosphorylated on serine 172 in the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase activation loop and that this phosphorylation is necessary for kinase activity. Also, rhIKK-i and rhTBK-1 have differential peptide substrate specificities compared with rhIKK-2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase activation loop of IKK-2 being a more favorable substrate than the IkappaBalpha peptide. Finally, using analogs of ATP, we demonstrate unique differences in the ATP-binding sites of rhIKK-i, rhTBK-1, and rhIKK-2. Thus, although these IKKs are structurally similar, their enzymatic properties may provide insights into their unique functions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Nandini Kishore","Q.
