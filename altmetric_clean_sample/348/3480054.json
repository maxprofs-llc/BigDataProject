In a yeast two-hybrid screen, two cellular proteins, cyclophilin A (CyPA) and FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12), interacted with YY1. These interactions are specific and also occur in mammalian cells. Cyclosporin A and FK506 efficiently disrupt the YY1-CyPA and YY1-FKBP12 interactions. Overexpression of human CyPA and FKBP12 have different effects on YY1-regulated transcription with these effects being promoter-dependent. These results suggest that immunophilins may be mediators in the functional role of YY1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Wen-Ming Yang","Carla J.
