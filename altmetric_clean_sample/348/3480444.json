It binds insulin-like growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II with high affinity, and is proposed to act as a paracrine regulator of cell growth. In situ hybridization studies with a cDNA encompassing the entire protein coding region of IGF-BP25 localized the gene to bands p12-p13 on chromosome 7. Southern blot analysis with the enzyme BglII revealed a common restriction fragment length polymorphism: the presence of the polymorphic BglII site results in the formation of two fragments 4.6 kb and 1.6 kb in size whereas its absence produces a single 6.2 kb fragment. The frequencies of the two alleles were 0.73 and 0.27, respectively. IGF-BP25 constitutes a useful genetic marker for the proximal short arm of chromosome 7.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a0d","authors":["T Alitalo","K Kontula","R Koistinen","K Aalto-Set\u00e4l\u00e4","M Julkunen","O A J\u00e4nne","M Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4","A de la Chapelle"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T23:37:04+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0340-6717"],"issue":"4","journal":"Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1197757086,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2478445"],"pmid":"2478445","pubdate":"1989-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"The gene encoding human low-molecular weight insulin-like growth-factor binding protein (IGF-BP25): regional localization to 7p12-p13 and description of a DNA polymorphism.","type":"article","volume":"83","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-encoding-human-lowmolecular-weight-insulinlike-growthfactor-binding-protein-igfbp25-regional-lo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627916,"mean":4.9454584244709,"rank":817435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627916,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95066,"mean":8.1267009940568,"rank":24652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95066,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1753,"mean":3.3512363013699,"rank":169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1753,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.075,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"IGFBP1","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=178171660#altmetric_citation_15","license":"public","citation_ids":[3480442,3480444],"posted_on":"2007-12-15T22:18:06+00:00","summary":"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IBP-1) also known as placental protein 12 (PP12) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IGFBP1 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14722711","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
