We here show that CR\/periphilin is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein with speckled distribution. Overexpression of CR\/periphilin induces S-phase arrest. Analysis of expression of regulators involved in DNA replication has revealed that both mRNA and protein expression of Cdc7, a regulator of the initiation and continuation of DNA replication, are markedly downregulated by overexpression of CR\/periphilin. However, co-expression of Cdc7 only marginally rescues S-phase arrest induced by CR, indicating that CR retards S-phase progression by modifying expression of some genes including Cdc7, which are involved in progression of DNA replication or coordination of DNA replication and S-phase progression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2004.09.083","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T03:06:25+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1199560895,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbrc.2004.09.083","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15474462"],"pmid":"15474462","pubdate":"2004-10-12T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Overexpression of CR\/periphilin downregulates Cdc7 expression and induces S-phase arrest.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overexpression-crperiphilin-downregulates-cdc7-expression-induces-sphase-arrest"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4868747,"mean":5.7971828146335,"rank":1188546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3088076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4868747,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176351,"mean":8.7001609413102,"rank":52077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":121947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176351,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6804,"mean":2.4986062031457,"rank":344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":2460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6804,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":2.10648,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
