The assay is based on the O-demethylation of 3-nitro-4-methoxybenzoate to the yellow-coloured product 3-nitro-4-hydroxybenzoate. Using this assay and by monitoring the oxidation rate of reduced pyridine nucleotides, the kinetic properties of a purified, reconstituted enzyme system composed of 4-methoxybenzoate monooxygenase (O-demethylating) and a reductase from Pseudomonas putida have been investigated. It has been found that the KM value of the monoxygenase of this enzyme system towards different substrates (i.e. tight couplers, uncouplers and partial uncouplers) rises from the extremely low value of 0.07 muM for the tight couplers to about 55 muM for the uncouplers. The effect of possible inhibitors and metal ions on the reconstituted enzyme system was investigated. The inhibition pattern was almost identical to that found for the purified reductase, only batho-phenanthrolinedisulfonate showing a greater inhibition of the reconstituted enzyme system. The affinity of the reductase towards NADH was found to be approximately 200-fold greater than that towards NADPH. Futhermore, the affinity of this reductase to NADH depended on the nature of the electron acceptor. The affinity to NADH was more than 10 times higher when the monooxygenase-substrate complex was used as the electron acceptor, than when cytochrome c or 2,6-dichloroindophenol was used. These differences are discussed on the basis of enzyme-enzyme interactions between the reductase and the monooxygenase.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002820","authors":["F H Bernhardt","W Nastainczyk","V Seydewitz"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T00:33:44+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0014-2956"],"issue":"1","journal":"European Journal of Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1194050929,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/188654"],"pmid":"188654","pubdate":"1977-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Kinetic studies on a 4-methoxybenzoate O-demethylase from Pseudomonas putida.","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kinetic-studies-4methoxybenzoate-odemethylase-pseudomonas-putida"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636226,"mean":4.9206251576887,"rank":816739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636226,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96455,"mean":8.2524369129327,"rank":25266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96455,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2662,"mean":2.8335888763623,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2662,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student (Postgraduate)":1},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"4-methoxybenzoate monooxygenase (O-demethylating)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=168850642#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3482502,3482504],"posted_on":"2007-11-03T00:48:49+00:00","summary":"The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-methoxybenzoate, an electron acceptor AH2, and O2, whereas its 4 products are 4-hydroxybenzoate, formaldehyde, the reduction product A, and H2O.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14044663","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"WillowW","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:WillowW"}}]}}
