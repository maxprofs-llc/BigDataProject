These studies indicate that the expressed p58 chromosomal gene maps to 1p36, while a highly related p58 sequence of unknown nature maps to chromosome 15. Assignment of a p34cdc2-related gene to 1p36 may have implications for numerous tumors that involve deletion of this region, including neuroblastoma, ductal carcinoma of the breast, malignant melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and endocrine neoplasia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002945","authors":["P G Eipers","B L Barnoski","J Han","A J Carroll","V J Kidd"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T01:55:38+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0888-7543"],"issue":"3","journal":"Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1197967273,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1774066"],"pmid":"1774066","pubdate":"1991-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Localization of the expressed human p58 protein kinase chromosomal gene to chromosome 1p36 and a highly related sequence to chromosome 15.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/localization-expressed-human-p58-protein-kinase-chromosomal-gene-chromosome-1p36-highly-related-sequ"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":817069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95230,"mean":8.1664971384769,"rank":24731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95230,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3834,"mean":2.710697104096,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3834,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.8321176470588,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
