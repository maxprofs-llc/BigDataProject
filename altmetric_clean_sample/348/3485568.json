The structure calculation is based on a total of 1808 intramolecular NOEs and 49 intermolecular NOEs between the peptide C20W and calmodulin from heteronuclear-filtered NOESY spectra and a half-filtered experiment, respectively. Chemical shift differences between free Ca(2+)-saturated CaM and its complex with C20W as well as the structure calculation reveal that C20W binds solely to the C-terminal half of CaM. In addition, comparison of the methyl resonances of the nine assigned methionine residues of free Ca(2+)-saturated CaM with those of the CaM\/C20W complex revealed a significant difference between the N-terminal and the C-terminal domain; i.e., resonances in the N-terminal domain of the complex were much more similar to those reported for free CaM in contrast to those in the C-terminal half which were significantly different not only from the resonances of free CaM but also from those reported for the CaM\/M13 complex. As a consequence, the global structure of the CaM\/C20W complex is unusual, i.e., different from other peptide calmodulin complexes, since we find no indication for a collapsed structure. The fine modulation in the peptide protein interface shows a number of differences to the CaM\/M13 complex studied by Ikura et al. [Ikura, M., Clore, G. M., Gronenborn, A. M., Zhu, G., Klee, C. B., and Bax, A. (1992) Science 256, 632-638]. The unusual binding mode to only the C-terminal half of CaM is in agreement with the biochemical observation that the calcium pump can be activated by the C-terminal half of CaM alone [Guerini, D., Krebs, J., and Carafoli, E. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15172-15177].","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["B Elshorst","M Hennig","H F\u00f6rsterling","A Diener","M Maurer","P Schulte","H Schwalbe","C Griesinger","J Krebs","H Schmid","T Vorherr","E Carafoli"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T01:53:34+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0006-2960"],"issue":"38","journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1197949673,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10493800"],"pmid":"10493800","pubdate":"1999-09-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"NMR solution structure of a complex of calmodulin with a binding peptide of the Ca2+ pump.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nmr-solution-structure-complex-calmodulin-binding-peptide-ca2-pump-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":816117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95769,"mean":8.2101932587088,"rank":24963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95769,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5464,"mean":2.463050704741,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5464,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.3329896907216,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
