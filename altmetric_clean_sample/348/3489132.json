To identify the protein(s) encoded in two novel mRNAs of 3.5 and 1.2 kb expressed in NIH 3T3 transformants, we constructed a cDNA library. One of the cDNA clones isolated (KS3) corresponded to the 1.2 kb mRNA and transformed NIH 3T3 cell when inserted into a mammalian expression vector. The 1152 nucleotide KS3 cDNA encodes a protein of 206 amino acids with significant homology to the growth factors basic FGF and acidic FGF. Expression of the KS3 product as a bacterial fusion protein or in COS cells allowed us to determine that both proteins had significant growth-promoting activity and that the COS cell protein was glycosylated. Thus one of the mRNAs transcribed from the KS oncogene encodes a growth factor that could transform cells by an autocrine mechanism and appears to represent a new member of the FGF family.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","authors":["P Delli Bovi","A M Curatola","F G Kern","A Greco","M Ittmann","C Basilico"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T03:45:25+00:00","issns":["0092-8674"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1198029742,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2957062"],"pmid":"2957062","pubdate":"1987-08-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"An oncogene isolated by transfection of Kaposi's sarcoma DNA encodes a growth factor that is a member of the FGF family.","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oncogene-isolated-transfection-kaposis-sarcoma-dna-encodes-growth-factor-member-fgf-family"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627775,"mean":4.946368885166,"rank":817497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627775,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95047,"mean":8.1280753529871,"rank":24657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95047,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7728,"mean":10.636217419438,"rank":2701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":2520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7728,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":79.256888888889,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
