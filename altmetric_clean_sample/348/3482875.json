Acupuncture was given on a predetermined schedule to both treatment and control groups, with status assessed regularly by independent, blinded raters. The study failed to show a significant difference between treatment and control groups. However, the study patients, as a whole, did remain in treatment longer than a retrospectively analyzed group who received no acupuncture.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002222","authors":["K C Otto","C Quinn","Y F Sung"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T00:43:13+00:00","issns":["1055-0496"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal on Addictions","last_mentioned_on":1391415854,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9598220"],"pmid":"9598220","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Auricular acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for cocaine addiction.
