It is unclear how immune activation is involved in the psychopathology. We investigated if elevated inflammation was associated with disease severity (trait) or current symptom level (state), comparing psychotic with general characteristics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034cc","doi":"10.1016\/j.schres.2012.12.023","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T00:32:00+00:00","issns":["0920-9964"],"journal":"Schizophrenia Research","last_mentioned_on":1432612281,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.schres.2012.12.023","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23403415"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.schres-journal.com\/article\/S0920996413000108\/pdf","pmid":"23403415","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 are associated with general severity and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interleukin-1-receptor-antagonist-soluble-tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1-associated-general-severi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5148574,"mean":6.0866090235122,"rank":1278859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3273238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5148574,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185176,"mean":8.762888251654,"rank":55155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":127545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185176,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2012,"mean":4.2583739433118,"rank":518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2012,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":5.6710526315789,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
