We have used in vitro binding studies employing bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase-p56lck fusion proteins and cell extracts to map regions on p56lck that are involved in binding to phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K). Deletions within the SH3 domain of p56lck abolished binding of PI3K activity from T-cell lysates, whereas deletion of the SH2 domain caused only a slight reduction in the level of PI3K activity bound to p56lck sequences. The binding of PI3K from T-cell extracts to p56lck was not blocked by antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, but p56lck-bound PI3K activity was sensitive to phosphatase treatment. The SH3 domain of p56lck also bound the majority of PI3K activity from uninfected chicken embryo fibroblasts. However, a drastically different binding specificity was observed with use of extracts of Rous sarcoma virus v-src-transformed cells, in which the majority of PI3K activity bound to the SH2 domain of p56lck in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. These results suggest that are two modes of PI3K binding to p56lck, and presumably to other Src-like tyrosine kinases. In one mode, PI3K from T cells or uninfected chicken embryo fibroblasts binds predominantly to the SH3 domain of p56lck. In the other mode, involving PI3K from Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells, binding is largely phosphotyrosine dependent and requires the SH2 domain of p56lck.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["L B Vogel","D J Fujita"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T02:52:28+00:00","issns":["0270-7306"],"issue":"12","journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1197989518,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7504174","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC364812"],"pmcid":"PMC364812","pmid":"7504174","pubdate":"1993-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"The SH3 domain of p56lck is involved in binding to phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase from T lymphocytes.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sh3-domain-p56lck-involved-binding-phosphatidylinositol-3kinase-t-lymphocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622323,"mean":4.9312868762118,"rank":816079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2282653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622323,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94123,"mean":7.3919969826076,"rank":23945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":69090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94123,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3660,"mean":2.473968297349,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3660,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.0077777777778,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"PIK3C3","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=178726136#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3487541],"posted_on":"2007-12-18T14:51:58+00:00","summary":"Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PIK3C3 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14764867","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
