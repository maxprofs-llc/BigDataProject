The characterization of the potent biological activities associated with several of the cytochrome P450-derived eicosanoids suggested new and important functional roles for these enzymes in cellular, organ, and body physiology, including the control of vascular reactivity and systemic blood pressures. Past and current advances in cytochrome P450 biochemistry and molecular biology facilitate the characterization of cytochrome P450 isoforms responsible for tissue\/organ specific arachidonic acid epoxidation and omega\/omega-1 hydroxylation, and thus, the analysis of cDNA and\/or gene specific functional phenotypes. The combined application of physiological, biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches is beginning to provide new insights into the physiological and\/or pathophysiological significance of these enzymes, their endogenous substrates, and products.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d1d","authors":["J H Capdevila","J R Falck","R C Harris"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T02:18:50+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-2275"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Lipid Research","last_mentioned_on":1197974124,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10681399"],"pmid":"10681399","pubdate":"2000-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Cytochrome P450 and arachidonic acid bioactivation.
