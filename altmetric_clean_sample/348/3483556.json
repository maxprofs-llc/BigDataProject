There are very few papers on an alternative rehabilitation approach; since many years we propose specific SEAS exercises and the aim of this study is to present one case report on this approach.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000897","authors":["Alessandra Negrini","Silvana Parzini","Maria Gabriella Negrini","Michele Romano","Salvatore Atanasio","Fabio Zaina","Stefano Negrini"],"doi":"10.1186\/1748-7161-3-20","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T00:55:36+00:00","issns":["1748-7161"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scoliosis","last_mentioned_on":1485975824,"links":["http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/3\/1\/20","http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/3\/1\/20#B19","https:\/\/scoliosisjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1748-7161-3-20"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scoliosisjournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1748-7161-3-20.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2639536","pmid":"19087344","pubdate":"2008-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"20","title":"Adult scoliosis can be reduced through specific SEAS exercises: a case report","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/scoliosisjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1748-7161-3-20","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adult-scoliosis-reduced-through-specific-seas-exercises-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":4333342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2259094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243148,"mean":8.3541906336496,"rank":124210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":92272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243148,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":3.7656684491979,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":15.656923076923,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
