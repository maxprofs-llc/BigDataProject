Here, we investigated whether ClC-2 is the apical Cl- channel associated with gastric acid secretion. Two anti-ClC-2 antibodies used in this study reacted with cloned ClC-2 protein expressed in HEK293 cells. In isolated rabbit gastric glands, significant expression of ClC-2 mRNA was observed, but the presence of ClC-2 protein was not clear. Furthermore, no expression of ClC-2 protein was observed in isolated rat and human gastric mucosa. Immunohistochemistry on the rat gastric mucosa showed no significant expression of ClC-2 protein in the parietal cells which showed abundant expression of H+,K+-ATPase. These results indicate that ClC-2 may not be a Cl- -transporting protein for gastric acid secretion in parietal cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","doi":"10.1016\/j.febslet.2004.08.044","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T03:39:11+00:00","issns":["0014-5793"],"journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1198028311,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.febslet.2004.08.044","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15388342"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.febsletters.org\/article\/S0014579304010622\/pdf","pmid":"15388342","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Is the ClC-2 chloride channel involved in the Cl- secretory mechanism of gastric parietal cells?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clc2-chloride-channel-involved-cl-secretory-mechanism-gastric-parietal-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635501,"mean":4.9219382456039,"rank":816760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635501,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96449,"mean":8.2526765096219,"rank":25262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96449,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3393,"mean":2.6228655660377,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3393,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.3653846153846,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
