An X-linked recessive transmission is suggested by the inheritance from the mothers in two generations of a moderate to severe form of mental retardation in six males, without any specific clinical findings. Two point linkage analysis demonstrated significant linkage between the disorder and two markers in Xq23 (Zmax = 3.75, theta = 0). Multipoint linkage analyses confirmed the significant linkage with a maximum lod score (Z = 3.96, theta = 0) at DXS1059. Recombination events observed with the flanking markers DXS1105 and DXS8067 delineate a 17 cM interval. This interval overlaps with several loci of XLMR disorders previously localized in Xq23-q24, which are reviewed herein.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9023cf058f61000ca38","authors":["V des Portes","N Soufir","A Carri\u00e9","P Billuart","T Bienvenu","M C Vinet","C Beldjord","G Ponsot","A Kahn","J Bou\u00e9","J Chelly","des Portes, V","Soufir, N","Carri\u00e9, A","Billuart, P","Bienvenu, T","Vinet, M C","Beldjord, C","Ponsot, G","Kahn, A","Bou\u00e9, J","Chelly, J"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T01:53:37+00:00","issns":["0148-7299"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1197949908,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9332663","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9332663"],"pmid":"9332663","pubdate":"1997-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Gene for nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX 47) is located in Xq22.3-q24.","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-nonspecific-xlinked-mental-retardation-mrx-47-located-xq223q24"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631090,"mean":4.9276517821564,"rank":816141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631090,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95747,"mean":8.2105512084058,"rank":24960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95747,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":696,"mean":2.6455194244604,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":696,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"PAK3","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=178650198#altmetric_citation_6","license":"public","citation_ids":[3485569],"posted_on":"2007-12-18T03:51:48+00:00","summary":"Serine\/threonine-protein kinase PAK 3 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PAK3 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14758041","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
