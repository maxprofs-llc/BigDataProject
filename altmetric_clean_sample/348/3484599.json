We recently localised the gene responsible for this disease (cyld1) to chromosome 16q12-q13 and provided evidence that it is a tumour suppressor gene (Biggs et al., 1995). We have now examined polymorphic markers on every chromosome, some of which are close to known tumour suppressor genes, in 25 tumours from 4 individuals with familial cylindromatosis. No loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected other than at loci on chromosome 16q. This observation suggests that the cyld1 gene may be the only tumour suppressor gene implicated in the development of cylindromas. We have also demonstrated LOH using markers on chromosome 16q in 8\/14 (57%) sporadic cylindromas, indicating that the cyld1 gene is likely to be involved in the genesis of both familial and sporadic cylindromas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","authors":["P J Biggs","P Chapman","S R Lakhani","J Burn","M R Stratton","Biggs, P J","Chapman, P","Lakhani, S R","Burn, J","Stratton, M R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T01:28:09+00:00","issns":["0950-9232"],"issue":"6","journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1197939240,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8649842"],"pmid":"8649842","pubdate":"1996-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"The cylindromatosis gene (cyld1) on chromosome 16q may be the only tumour suppressor gene involved in the development of cylindromas.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cylindromatosis-gene-cyld1-chromosome-16q-only-tumour-suppressor-gene-involved-development-cylindrom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991404,"mean":5.0365276857663,"rank":917058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991404,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126976,"mean":9.1313721135371,"rank":38635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126976,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3458,"mean":2.5991267361111,"rank":326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3458,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":2.610447761194,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"CYLD (gene)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=178618863#altmetric_citation_5","license":"public","citation_ids":[3484599],"posted_on":"2007-12-18T00:54:00+00:00","summary":"Cylindromatosis (turban tumor syndrome), also known as CYLD, is a human gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14755285","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
