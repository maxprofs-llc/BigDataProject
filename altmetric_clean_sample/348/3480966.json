This protein has also been shown to be associated with band 3 (ref. 4), the major transmembrane protein which links a cytoplasmic structural protein to an integral membrane protein. A water-soluble, 72,000-MW, proteolytic fragment of ankyrin has been purified which retains the ability to bind to spectrin, and competitively inhibits reassociation of spectrin with membranes. Monospecific antibodies directed against this fragment have been prepared and demonstrated to cross-react only with ankyrin among the erythrocyte membrane proteins. The present study reports the use of these antibodies to develop a radioimmunoassay capable of detecting femtomolar quantities of ankyrin, and demonstrates the presence of small but significant amounts of immunoreactivity in a variety of types of cells and tissues.","ads_id":"1979Natur.281..597B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Vann Bennett","Bennett, V"],"doi":"10.1038\/281597a0","endpage":"599","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T23:51:34+00:00","issns":["${footerJournalISSN}","${footerJournalEISSN}","0028-0836"],"issue":"5732","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1203235917,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/281597a0","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/492324"],"pmid":"492324","pubdate":"1979-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"597","title":"Immunoreactive forms of human erythrocyte ankyrin are present in diverse cells and tissues.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/281597a0","volume":"281","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunoreactive-forms-human-erythrocyte-ankyrin-present-diverse-cells-tissues"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4575816,"mean":5.3764004311399,"rank":1059797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2946972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4575816,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155255,"mean":8.9697297589757,"rank":45616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":107681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155255,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10520,"mean":3.807143454701,"rank":2038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":4338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10520,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":2.1889032258065,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
