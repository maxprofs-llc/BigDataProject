The domains of the S1S2 ligand binding core are expanded in the apo state and contract upon ligand binding with the extent of domain separation decreasing in the order of apo > DNQX > kainate > glutamate approximately equal to AMPA. These results suggest that agonist-induced domain closure gates the transmembrane channel and the extent of receptor activation depends upon the degree of domain closure. AMPA and glutamate also promote a 180 degrees flip of a trans peptide bond in the ligand binding site. The crystal packing of the ligand binding cores suggests modes for subunit-subunit contact in the intact receptor and mechanisms by which allosteric effectors modulate receptor activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Armstrong, N","Gouaux, E"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0896-6273(00)00094-5","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T01:03:48+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0896-6273"],"issue":"1","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1197936894,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0896-6273(00)00094-5","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11086992"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0896627300000945\/pdf","pmid":"11086992","pubdate":"2000-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Mechanisms for activation and antagonism of an AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptor: crystal structures of the GluR2 ligand binding core.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanisms-activation-antagonism-ampasensitive-glutamate-receptor-crystal-structures-glur2-ligand-bi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630009,"mean":4.9312762825916,"rank":816227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630009,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95539,"mean":8.1950058615422,"rank":24856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95539,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3775,"mean":10.07339427663,"rank":1397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3775,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":15.285454545455,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":15,"Researcher":40,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
