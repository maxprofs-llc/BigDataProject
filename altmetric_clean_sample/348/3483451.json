Its formation is catalyzed by an oxidoreductase, which is NADH or NADPH dependent and has an apparent Km value of 66.66 microM for santonin and 44.33 microM for NADH. The enzyme activity is stable at pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, and is not affected by EDTA and divalent metal ions. It is postulated that the enzymic reduction of santonin occurs via formation of a transient zwitterionic intermediate, which undergoes nonenzymatic 1,4-sigmatropic rearrangement to yield lumisantonin during the solvent extraction process. Lumisantonin is, thus, not a true metabolic intermediate but an artifact.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000da6","authors":["U Naik","S Mavuinkurve"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T00:53:31+00:00","issns":["0008-4166"],"issue":"8","journal":"Canadian Journal of Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1194038305,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3690421"],"pmid":"3690421","pubdate":"1987-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"alpha-Santonin 1,2-reductase and its role in the formation of dihydrosantonin and lumisantonin by Pseudomonas cichorii S.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alphasantonin-12reductase-role-formation-dihydrosantonin-lumisantonin-pseudomonas-cichorii-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95594,"mean":8.1953117696905,"rank":24883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95594,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":420,"mean":1.971522673031,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":420,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.3045454545455,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Alpha-santonin 1,2-reductase","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=168810859#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3483449,3483451],"posted_on":"2007-11-02T21:18:25+00:00","summary":"The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 1,2-dihydrosantonin, NAD+, and NADP+, whereas its 4 products are alpha-santonin, NADH, NADPH, and H+.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14040976","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"WillowW","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:WillowW"}}]}}
