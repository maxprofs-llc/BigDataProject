Hypoxia causes the stabilization of the HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1) transcription factor and the induction of many genes that promote angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. We performed representational difference analysis (RDA) using mRNA extracted from hypoxic and normoxic Capan-2, a human pancreatic cancer cell line. cDNAs corresponding to hypoxia-inducible genes were cloned and sequenced. We identified GPI\/NLK\/AMF (glucose phosphate isomerase\/neuroleukin\/autocrine motility factor) as a hypoxic inducible gene. In addition, hexokinase II and DEC1\/Stra13, genes known to be hypoxia inducible in other systems, were found to be hypoxia inducible in our pancreatic cancer system. We thus identified three genes that are induced by hypoxia in a human pancreatic cancer, including GPI\/NLK\/AMF, which was not previously known to be hypoxia inducible in any other system. These genes may provide new targets for diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Diana Y. Yoon","Peter Buchler","Sirkku T.
