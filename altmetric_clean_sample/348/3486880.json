Here we show that two distinct protein-DNA complexes (A and B), which exhibit similar binding characteristics and identical contact points on the X box, can be formed. This suggests the existence of a family of related X box-binding factors. Complex B (and not complex A) is specifically affected in primary combined immunodeficiency, a congenital defect in class II gene regulation. RFX1, the first X box-binding protein cloned, encodes a functionally relevant factor present in complex A and not in complex B as originally suspected. This report also illustrates the need for caution in correlating specific cloned proteins with nuclear factors identified by DNA-binding assays, particularly when dealing with families of related proteins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["C Herrero Sanchez","W Reith","P Silacci","B Mach"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T02:30:33+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0270-7306"],"issue":"9","journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1197982611,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1508204","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC360302"],"pmcid":"PMC360302","pmid":"1508204","pubdate":"1992-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"The DNA-binding defect observed in major histocompatibility complex class II regulatory mutants concerns only one member of a family of complexes binding to the X boxes of class II promoters.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dnabinding-defect-observed-major-histocompatibility-complex-class-ii-regulatory-mutants-concerns-onl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627218,"mean":4.9497513377373,"rank":817745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627218,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94892,"mean":8.111411725032,"rank":24594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94892,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3660,"mean":2.4726482645532,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3660,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.0077777777778,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
