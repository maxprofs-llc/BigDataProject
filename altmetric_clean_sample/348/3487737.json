Here we assess the effect that viral cyclin has on the intracellular location of human Orc1, which is present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic pools. Overexpression of K cyclin or cyclin A results in Crm1-dependent export of Orc1 to the cytoplasm, and this process is dependent on the phosphorylation status of several cdk target sites in Orc1. These findings support a model where S phase promoting cyclin activity drives the export of a component of replication complexes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002890","authors":["H Laman","Laman, H","Peters, G","Jones, N","Heike Laman","Gordon Peters","Nic Jones"],"doi":"10.1006\/excr.2001.5360","endpage":"237","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T02:58:53+00:00","issns":["00144827","0014-4827"],"issue":"2","journal":"Experimental Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1292828230,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1006\/excr.2001.5360","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11716535"],"pmid":"11716535","pubdate":"2001-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"230","title":"Cyclin-mediated export of human Orc1.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0014482701953601","volume":"271","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cyclinmediated-export-human-orc1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681522,"mean":5.6990934027662,"rank":1130572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2962291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681522,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164696,"mean":9.0188389325725,"rank":49180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":113315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164696,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1094,"mean":2.3362433668801,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1094,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.99814814814815,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
