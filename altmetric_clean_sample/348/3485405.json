Binding studies showed that beta 2-syntrophin and MAST205\/SAST associated via a PDZ-PDZ domain interaction. MAST205 colocalized with beta 2-syntrophin and utrophin at neuromuscular junctions. SAST colocalized with syntrophin in cerebral vasculature, spermatic acrosomes and neuronal processes. SAST and syntrophin were highly associated with purified microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins, whereas utrophin and dystrophin were only partially associated with microtubules. Our data suggest that MAST205 and SAST link the dystrophin\/utrophin network with microtubule filaments via the syntrophins.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","authors":["Jeffrey S.
