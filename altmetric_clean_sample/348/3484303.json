The process of diapedesis, in which the leukocyte crawls between tightly apposed endothelial cells, is a unique and complex process. Several molecules concentrated at the junctions of endothelial cells, originally described as having a role in holding the endothelial monolayer together, have also been shown to have a role in the emigration of leukocytes. Several mechanisms have been proposed for 'loosening' the junctions between endothelial cells to enable leukocyte passage. These leukocyte-endothelial-cell adhesion molecules are probably involved in regulating the signaling as well as the adhesion events of diapedesis. In addition, this Review introduces a new and unified nomenclature for the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ae","authors":["William A Muller"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T01:18:26+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-4906"],"issue":"6","journal":"Trends in Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1198136019,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12810109"],"pmid":"12810109","pubdate":"2003-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Leukocyte-endothelial-cell interactions in leukocyte transmigration and the inflammatory response.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/leukocyteendothelialcell-interactions-leukocyte-transmigration-inflammatory-response"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636263,"mean":4.9213309833055,"rank":816843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636263,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96465,"mean":8.2651396583183,"rank":25286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96465,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":431,"mean":2.4694790697674,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":431,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":6.9,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":47,"Student  > Doctoral Student":13,"Student  > Ph.
