We report here that MAP kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) gene disruption does not affect either MAP kinase activation or cytokine gene expression in response to cross-linking of FcepsilonRI in embryonic stem cell-derived mast cells. MKK7 is activated in response to cross-linking of FcepsilonRI, and this activation is inhibited by MAP\/ERK kinase (MEK) kinase 2 (MEKK2) gene disruption. In addition, expression of kinase-inactive MKK7 in the murine mast cell line MC\/9 inhibits c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in response to cross-linking of FcepsilonRI, whereas expression of kinase-inactive MKK4 does not affect JNK activation by this stimulus. However, FcepsilonRI-induced activation of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene promoter is not affected by expression of kinase-inactive MKK7. We describe an alternative pathway by which MEKK2 activates MEK5 and big MAP kinase1\/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 in addition to MKK7 and JNK, and interruption of this pathway inhibits TNF-alpha promoter activation. These findings suggest that JNK activation by antigen cross-linking is dependent on the MEKK2-MKK7 pathway, and cytokine production in mast cells is regulated in part by the signaling complex MEKK2-MEK5-ERK5.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2001PNAS...98.4599C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Kosuke Chayama","Philip J.
