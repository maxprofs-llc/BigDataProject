A cDNA clone was identified and sequenced, encoding a protein designated as osteoblast specific factor 3 (OSF-3) comprising 199 amino acids. RNA dot blot analysis indicated weak OSF-3 expression in thymus, spleen, brain, lung, testis, and heart, and high expression in kidney and liver. A homology search of an amino acid sequence database revealed a strong relationship of OSF-3 to the MER5 (gene preferentially expression in murine erythroleukemia cells) protein and human pag (proliferation associated gene) product. This indicates that OSF-3 plays an intrinsic role in the proliferation and\/or differentiation of bone cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f81","authors":["S Kawai","S Takeshita","M Okazaki","R Kikuno","A Kudo","E Amann"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T01:09:46+00:00","issns":["0021-924X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1197935923,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8089076"],"pmid":"8089076","pubdate":"1994-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Cloning and characterization of OSF-3, a new member of the MER5 family, expressed in mouse osteoblastic cells.","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-characterization-osf3-new-member-mer5-family-expressed-mouse-osteoblastic-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":817222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95166,"mean":8.1656567015185,"rank":24710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95166,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":649,"mean":2.4375154320988,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":649,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.88636363636364,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
