No effective treatment is available, resulting in an ominous clinical course, with overall survival averaging less than four months. We report rearrangement of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase in a pediatric case of RMC harboring a t(2;10)(p23;q22) translocation. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic evaluation identified a novel ALK oncoprotein in which the cytoskeletal protein vinculin (VCL) was fused to the ALK kinase domain. The resulting VCL-ALK fusion does not contain known self-association domains, but includes the talin binding domains of vinculin. We demonstrate coprecipitation of strongly tyrosine phosphorylated talins with the VCL-ALK oncoprotein, suggesting that ALK oncogenic crossphosphorylation is mediated by interactions between neighboring VCL-ALK proteins on a talin scaffold. This report widens the spectrum of ALK-related tumors and ALK fusion partners, and provides a rationale for treating RMC with targeted ALK inhibitors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007519","doi":"10.1002\/gcc.20839","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T00:17:29+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Genes, Chromosomes, and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1357473202,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/gcc.20839","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21213368"],"pmid":"21213368","pubdate":"2011-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"ALK rearrangement in sickle cell trait-associated renal medullary carcinoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alk-rearrangement-sickle-cell-traitassociated-renal-medullary-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":816195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95725,"mean":8.2094850194311,"rank":24950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95725,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":2.0924532577904,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.45,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
