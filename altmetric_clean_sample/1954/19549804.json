We hypothesised that gastric juice and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding devices might yield MABSC isolates. Gastric juice and sputa from sixteen adult PEG fed CF patients and five replaced PEG tubes were studied. Bacterial and fungal isolates were cultured. Mycobacterium were identified by rpoB, sodA and hsp65 gene sequencing and strain typed using variable number tandem repeat. Bacteria and\/or fungi grew from all gastric juice, sputa and PEG samples. MABSC were detected in 7 patients. Five had MABSC in their sputum. Two had an identical MABSC strain in their sputum and gastric juice and one had the same strain isolated from their PEG tube and sputum. Two patients who were sputum sample negative had MABSC isolated in their gastric juice or PEG tube. MABSC were therefore identified for the first time from a gastric sample in a minority of patients. We conclude that gastric juice and PEG-tubes may be a potential source of MABSC isolates in CF patients, and these findings warrant further study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Al-momani, H.","Perry, A.","Jones, R.","Bourke, S.","Doe, S.","Perry, J.","Anderson, A.","Forrest, T.","Forrest, I.","Griffin, M.","Brodlie, M.","Pearson, J.","Ward, C.","H.
