Different from the other methods used elevated temperatures for nanoparticles synthesis, the novelty of our method lies in its energy saving process and fast synthesis rates (~5min for AuNPs), and its potential to tune the nanoparticles size and afterward their catalytic activity. The starch, fatty acid and reducing sugars present in the extract are mostly responsible for repaid reduction rate Au(+3) ions to AuNPs. Strong Plasmon resonance (SPR) of AuNPs was observed at 560nm, which indicates the formation of gold nanoparticles. Uv-visible spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and energy dispersion X-ray diffraction (XRD) were preformed to find out the formation of AuNPs. Proficient reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) into 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in the presence of AuNPs and NaBH4 was observed and was found to depend upon the nanoparticle size or the extract concentration. The AuNPs was also evaluated for antibacterial against P. aeruginosa. Before transferred it into antibacterial activity, it placed under visible light for 120min. The same experiment was performed in dark as control medium. The photo irradiated AuNPs was observed to be more effective against P. aeruginosa. The result showed that diameter of zone of inhibition of visible light irradiated AuNPs against P. aeruginosa was 17 (\u00b10.5) and in dark was 8 (\u00b10.4) mm.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec1","authors":["Shafiullah Khan","Wang Runguo","Kamran Tahir","Zhang Jichuan","Liqun Zhang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jphotobiol.2017.04.006","first_seen_on":"2017-04-25T10:28:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10111344","1873-2682"],"journal":"Journal of Photochemistry & Photobiology B: Biology","last_mentioned_on":1493116085,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28437746?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28437746","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Health Professions","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol and photo inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using gold nanoparticles as photocatalyst","type":"article","volume":"170","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/catalytic-reduction-4nitrophenol-photo-inhibition-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-using-gold-nanoparticles-ph"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8099079,"mean":6.8881653514065,"rank":4283831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2248480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8099079,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233505,"mean":12.659785716733,"rank":129930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":82195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233505,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":460,"mean":2.2049455337691,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":460,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.25,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
