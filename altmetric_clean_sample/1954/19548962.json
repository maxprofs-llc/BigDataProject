Their structure characterization was unequivocally carried out using one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, as well as high-resolution mass spectrometry. The cytotoxic activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated toward MCF7, A549, HCT116, PC12, and Hela cancer cell lines. Ingenine E (4) exhibited cytotoxic activity against MCF7, HCT116, and A549 cell lines with IC50 values of 3.5, 0.67, and 2.15\u00a0\u03bcg\/ml.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f61000119d","authors":["Sabrin R.
