Participants completed six over-ground walking trials at the preferred speed and at 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5ms(-1), each lasting 6min. The steps taken were measured with hand-tally and with the Walk4Life MVPa piezoelectric pedometer. Pedometer accuracy was assessed with absolute percent error and Bland-Altman plots.\nAbsolute percent error did not differ between persons with and without DS across speeds. Error decreased with increased speed (p<0.001), but leveled off at \u22651.0ms(-1). Pedometers underestimated steps at 0.5 and 0.75ms(-1), but were highly accurate at the preferred walking speed and at speeds \u22651.0ms(-1).\nA piezoelectric pedometer with a tri-axial accelerometer mechanism measures steps with high accuracy at the preferred walking speed and at speeds \u22651.0ms(-1) in persons with and without DS. Accuracy, however, is compromised at slower speeds. Across speeds, pedometer error is similar between persons with and without DS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003464","authors":["Agiovlasitis, Stamatis","Beets, Michael W","Lamberth, John","Pitetti, Kenneth H","Fernhall, Bo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ridd.2016.08.003","endpage":"79","first_seen_on":"2016-11-20T11:46:58+00:00","issns":["1873-3379","08914222"],"journal":"Research in Developmental Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1479642396,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0891422216301718"],"pmid":"27518921","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"73","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Accuracy of a piezoelectric pedometer in persons with and without Down syndrome","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/accuracy-piezoelectric-pedometer-persons-without-down-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7719347,"mean":6.622418915792,"rank":4001368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2170169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7719347,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247536,"mean":12.172995568303,"rank":135383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247536,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1369,"mean":3.0718611111111,"rank":711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1369,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":4.5741666666667,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
