In C. elegans, PUF proteins FBF-1 and FBF-2 support germline progenitor maintenance by repressing production of meiotic proteins and use distinct mechanisms to repress their target mRNAs. We identify dynein light chain DLC-1 as an important new regulator of FBF-2 function. DLC-1 directly binds to FBF-2 outside of the RNA-binding domain and promotes FBF-2 localization and function. By contrast, DLC-1 does not interact with FBF-1 and does not contribute to FBF-1 activity. Surprisingly, we find that DLC-1 contribution to FBF-2 activity is independent of the dynein motor. Our findings suggest that PUF protein localization and activity is mediated by sequences flanking the RNA-binding domain that bind specific molecular partners. Furthermore, these results identify a new role for DLC-1 in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","authors":["Wang, Xiaobo","Olson, Jenessa R","Rasoloson, Dominique","Ellenbecker, Mary","Bailey, Jessica","Voronina, Ekaterina","Xiaobo Wang","Jenessa R.
