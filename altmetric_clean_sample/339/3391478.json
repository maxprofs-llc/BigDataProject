A limited number of OR-like sequences have been found in invertebrate chordate genomes. Whether these gene families arose in basal or advanced vertebrates has not been resolved because these families have not been examined systematically in agnathan genomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b5","authors":["Scot Libants","Kevin Carr","Hong Wu","John H Teeter","Yu-Wen Chung-Davidson","Ziping Zhang","Curt Wilkerson","Weiming Li"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2148-9-180","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T11:34:44+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1337813415,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2148-9-180"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2148-9-180.pdf","pmid":"19646260","pubdate":"2009-07-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Systematics\/Taxonomy\/Biogeography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics and Population Dynamics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"180","subjects":["biology"],"title":"The sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus genome reveals the early origin of several chemosensory receptor families in the vertebrate lineage","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sea-lamprey-petromyzon-marinus-genome-reveals-early-origin-several-chemosensory-receptor-families-ve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4164421,"mean":5.1201220943759,"rank":972080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2629139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4164421,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132899,"mean":9.0344487200712,"rank":40897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":90115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132899,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1307,"mean":7.1183108728943,"rank":536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1307,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":11.456093023256,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
