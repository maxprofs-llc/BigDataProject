The use of this screening technique by clinical microbiology laboratories could tackle the spread of high-risk clones by the quick implementation of hygiene control procedures for concerned patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Nad\u00e8ge Cabrolier","Marl\u00e8ne Sauget","Xavier Bertrand","Didier Hocquet"],"doi":"10.1128\/jcm.00210-15","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T16:03:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-660X"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1457436394,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25653397?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25653397","pubdate":"2015-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry identifies Pseudomonas aeruginosa high-risk clones.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/matrixassisted-laser-desorption-ionizationtime-flight-mass-spectrometry-identifies-pseudomonas-aerug"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7367623,"mean":6.4006371575483,"rank":3343842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3859478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7367623,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233076,"mean":8.0449861546713,"rank":96441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":129014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233076,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3944,"mean":4.1508485924423,"rank":2136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3944,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":3.0449494949495,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
