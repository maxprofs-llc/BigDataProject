A family based association test was utilized to test for association of these SNPs to the phenotypes of psychosis and schizophrenia. Haplotypes defined by these three SNPs showed significant association to the phenotype of psychosis in this sample (global p value=0.014, bi-allelic p value=0.047). Variation in the Epsin 4 gene is significantly associated with psychotic disorder in this Latino population. This provides additional support for the involvement of enthoprotin in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034cc","authors":["Escamilla, Michael","Lee, Byung Dae","Ontiveros, Alfonso","Raventos, Henriette","Nicolini, Humberto","Mendoza, Ricardo","Jerez, Alvaro","Munoz, Rodrigo","Medina, Rolando","Figueroa, Andres","Walss-Bass, Consuelo","Armas, Regina","Contreras, Salvador","Ramirez, Mercedes E","Dassori, Albana"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.schres.2008.09.005","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T11:33:38+00:00","issns":["0920-9964"],"issue":"2-3","journal":"Schizophrenia Research","last_mentioned_on":1236108532,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0920-9964(08)00412-X","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.schres.2008.09.005","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18929466"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.schres-journal.com\/article\/S092099640800412X\/pdf","pmid":"18929466","pubdate":"2015-06-08T22:48:43+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"The epsin 4 gene is associated with psychotic disorders in families of Latin American origin","type":"article","volume":"106","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epsin-4-gene-associated-psychotic-disorders-families-latin-american-origin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4417810,"mean":4.8211342378733,"rank":981743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2864998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4417810,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145472,"mean":7.6792539956418,"rank":39461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":104203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145472,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1754,"mean":3.5757626925271,"rank":483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1754,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":5.5255102040816,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"CLINT1","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=274746171#altmetric_citation_22","license":"public","citation_ids":[3391436],"posted_on":"2009-03-03T19:28:52+00:00","summary":"Clathrin interactor 1 (CLINT1), also known as EPSIN4, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the CLINT1 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14816550","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
