However, the activity of the expressed channel is reduced by PKA inhibitors. Using this paradigm as an assay to search for PKA sites relevant to channel modulation, we have found that mutation of serine 1928 of the alpha 1C subunit to alanine abolishes the modulation of the expressed channel by PKA inhibitors. This effect was independent of the presence of the beta subunit. Phosphorylation of serine 1928 of alpha 1C may mediate the modulatory effect of PKA on the cardiac voltage-dependent ca2+ channel.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","doi":"10.1016\/0014-5793(96)00303-1","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T12:53:39+00:00","issns":["0014-5793"],"journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1197918713,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/0014-5793(96)00303-1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8612821"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.febsletters.org\/article\/0014579396003031\/pdf","pmid":"8612821","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"A potential site of functional modulation by protein kinase A in the cardiac Ca2+ channel alpha 1C subunit.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-site-functional-modulation-protein-kinase-cardiac-ca2-channel-%CE%B11c-subunit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":817854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93446,"mean":8.00772296003,"rank":24124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93446,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3393,"mean":2.6245742924528,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3393,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.4086206896552,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Cav1.2","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=178554397#altmetric_citation_11","license":"public","citation_ids":[3394123],"posted_on":"2007-12-17T19:11:53+00:00","summary":"Calcium channel, voltage-dependent, L type, alpha 1C subunit (also known as Cav1.2) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CACNA1C gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=7012714","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Hodja Nasreddin","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Hodja Nasreddin"}}]}}
