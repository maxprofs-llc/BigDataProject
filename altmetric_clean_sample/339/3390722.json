Such terminals are thought to arise exclusively from layer 5 in the cat and primate (Lund et al. [1975] J. Comp. Neurol. 164:287-304; Abramson and Chalupa [1985] Neuroscience 15:81-95). All labeled terminals in both nuclei exhibited the morphology of ascending \"lemniscal\" afferents. That is, they contained round vesicles, were large, made asymmetrical synaptic and filamentous nonsynaptic contacts, and were classified as RLs. These cortical RLs also exhibited the postsynaptic relationships of lemniscal afferents. Thus, they were presynaptic to large dendrites within glial encapsulated glomeruli, where a majority was involved in complex synaptic arrangements called triads. They also were found adjacent to terminal profiles with pleomorphic vesicles but never adjacent to small terminals containing round vesicles. Our results suggest that the layer 5 projection from area 17 provides a functional \"drive\" for some LPl and IPm neurons. Information carried over this \"re-entrant\" pathway (Guillery [1995] J. Anat. 187:583-592) could be modified within the LPl and IPm by both cortical and subcortical pathways and subsequently conveyed to higher visual cortical areas, where it could be integrated with messages carried through the well-documented corticocortical pathways (Casagrande and Kaas [1994] Cerebral cortex New York: Plenum Press).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9043cf058f61000ca56","authors":["S Feig","J K Harting"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T11:16:46+00:00","issns":["0021-9967"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Comparative Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1325820312,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9596524"],"pmid":"9596524","pubdate":"1998-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Corticocortical communication via the thalamus: ultrastructural studies of corticothalamic projections from area 17 to the lateral posterior nucleus of the cat and inferior pulvinar nucleus of the owl monkey.","type":"article","volume":"395","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/corticocortical-communication-via-thalamus-ultrastructural-studies-corticothalamic-projections-area"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635048,"mean":4.9225817734301,"rank":816707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635048,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94832,"mean":8.1540579557319,"rank":24760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94832,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":702,"mean":2.9112011412268,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":702,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.93947368421053,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
