Nanospatial factors often hold the key to a deeper understanding of the properties of matter at the nanoscale level. With recent advances in tomography, it is possible to achieve experimental resolution in the nanometre range, and to determine with elemental specificity the three-dimensional distribution of materials. This critical review deals principally with electron tomography, but it also outlines the power and future potential of transmission X-ray tomography, and alludes to other related techniques.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ee","authors":["Paul A.
