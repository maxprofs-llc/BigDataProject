Nuclear import is opposed by kinases such as GSK3, thereby rendering transcription continuously responsive to receptor occupancy. Disruptions of the genes involved in NFAT signaling are implicating this pathway as a regulator of developmental cell-cell interactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","authors":["Crabtree, Gerald R","Olson, Eric N"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0092-8674(02)00699-2","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T15:01:32+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0092-8674"],"journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1199026365,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0092-8674(02)00699-2","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11983154"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0092867402006992\/pdf","pmid":"11983154","pubdate":"2002-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"NFAT signaling: choreographing the social lives of cells.","type":"article","volume":"109 Suppl","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nfat-signaling-choreographing-social-lives-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":816601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93953,"mean":8.0733445376364,"rank":24328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93953,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7728,"mean":10.633458522065,"rank":2695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":2527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7728,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":120.06472727273,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":21,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":74,"Student  > Doctoral Student":16,"Student  > Ph.
