Keratinocytes have been shown to produce IL-7. which in turn can elicit a variety of biological responses on several cell types residing in the skin. IL-7 has been demonstrated to augment the cytolytic activity of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells against various neoplastic targets including melanoma cells. Proliferation and long-term survival of murine dendritic epidermal T lymphocytes (DETC) in vitro is supported by IL-7. IL-7 also induces secretion of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes\/macrophages and renders these cells to become tumoricidal against melanoma cells. Normal and malignant melanocytes respond to IL-7 with increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1). In addition, IL-7 has been shown to act as growth factor for Sezary cells, suggesting a role of keratinocyte-derived IL-7 in the pathogenesis of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Because of the potent in vitro immunomodulatory effects of IL-7 which have been confirmed in mouse tumor models, IL-7 may become a valuable additional agent to immunotherapeutical regimens currently studied in patients with advanced melanoma. This review summarizes our present knowledge about the molecular and immunological properties of IL7 with emphasis on the effects of that cytokine within the cutaneous compartment and the potential clinical utility in dermatology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002891","authors":["P M\u00f6ller","M B\u00f6hm","B M Czarnetszki","D Schadendorf"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T11:07:59+00:00","issns":["0906-6705"],"issue":"3","journal":"Experimental Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1197228297,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8840152"],"pmid":"8840152","pubdate":"1996-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Interleukin-7.
