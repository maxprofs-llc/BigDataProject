The test includes control and test cupules for fluorogenic detection of coagulase and chromogenic substrates for alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase. These tests identify S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus, respectively. Positive results with both chromogenic substrates provide a presumptive identification of S. xylosus or S. intermedius (S. xylosus-S. intermedius). Test cupules are inoculated with an organism suspension, and reactions are read after a 2-h incubation. RapiDEC-Staph was evaluated with 303 clinical and stock staphylococcal strains. Identifications were compared with those obtained by the tube coagulase test, a latex slide coagulase test (StaphAUREX), another commercial identification system (Staph-TRAC), and additional conventional tests. RapiDEC-Staph correctly identified 100% of 130 S. aureus strains, 70.3% of 74 S. epidermidis strains, and 81.3% of 32 S. saprophyticus strains. Four of five S. xylosus isolates were called S. xylosus-S. intermedius. Unidentified S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains were called \"Staphylococcus spp.\" Among the 62 other coagulase-negative staphylococci, 4 were misidentified as S. epidermidis and 7 were misidentified as S. saprophyticus. While the sensitivity and specificity of the fluorogenic coagulase test for S. aureus were 100%, failure to detect alkaline phosphatase activity in several S. epidermidis isolates resulted in fewer correct identifications by the RapiDEC-Staph test for this species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["W M Janda","K Ristow","D Novak"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T11:14:23+00:00","issns":["0095-1137"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1220542502,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7814525","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC263941"],"pmcid":"PMC263941","pmid":"7814525","pubdate":"1994-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Evaluation of RapiDEC Staph for identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-rapidec-staph-identification-staphylococcus-aureus-staphylococcus-epidermidis-staphylococ"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622323,"mean":4.9314823624217,"rank":816132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2282585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622323,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92790,"mean":7.2888909461251,"rank":23563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92790,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2430,"mean":2.5985969534788,"rank":297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2430,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.7990740740741,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
