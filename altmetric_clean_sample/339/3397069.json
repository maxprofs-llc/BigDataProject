The prevalence of ICP was significantly higher in twin than in single pregnancies (20.9% versus 4.7%, respectively; P less than 0.001). Urinary estriol excretion was also significantly higher in twin compared to single pregnancies, although no quantitative differences were detected in TP with or without ICP. In multiparous patients with a proband TP affected by ICP, the disease recurred only in further TP, emphasizing the important role that estrogens seem to play in the pathogenesis of ICP. In contrast, in multiparous patients with a proband single pregnancy affected by ICP, the disease occurred in 70.5% of their other single pregnancies, suggesting the presence of a metabolic predisposition in these cases. However, in both groups of multiparous women a notable number of single pregnancies were not affected by the disease, supporting the postulate that the pathogenesis of ICP is multifactorial and that some as yet unidentified environmental factor needs to be present in order to develop the disease and also to modulate its expressivity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ddb","authors":["M C Gonzalez","H Reyes","M Arrese","D Figueroa","B Lorca","M Andresen","N Segovia","C Molina","S Arce"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T14:46:22+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0168-8278"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1256354750,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2768798"],"pmid":"2768798","pubdate":"1989-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in twin pregnancies.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intrahepatic-cholestasis-pregnancy-twin-pregnancies-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627694,"mean":4.9472740289804,"rank":817543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627694,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93674,"mean":8.0305423761384,"rank":24222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93674,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":962,"mean":3.1551404786681,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":962,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":2.3205882352941,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
