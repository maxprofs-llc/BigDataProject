Four sex and age matched groups of veterinary students and medical personnel received the vaccine. The vaccine was given according to WHO recommendations for pre- and postexposure regimens. The 82 volunteers were divided into four groups and vaccinated as follows. Group IA consisted of 27 individuals, receiving injections on days 0, 7 and 21. Group IB consisted of 29 individuals, injected on days 0, 28 and 56. Group II consisted of 16 individuals, receiving a postexposure schedule of vaccinations on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 90. Group III consisted of 10 subjects, all of whom had been previously immunized with various antirabies vaccines and received one single booster inoculation of this vaccine. Serum samples were taken on the days of vaccination and 14 days later in all groups and in addition on day 70 in group IA. Neutralizing antibodies against the rabies virus were determined in the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). In conclusion it can be stated that, regardless of the schedule of prophylactic immunization, three 0.5 ml inoculations of PVRV result in very high titres of virus neutralizing antibodies and a single vaccination in previously immunized individuals is sufficient to raise the amount of antibodies to a high level. Due to the high purity of the product the vaccine is very well tolerated by the vaccinees.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["W Klietmann","B Klietmann","J Cox","C Charbonnier"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T11:02:26+00:00","issns":["0264-410X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1365767632,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3354256"],"pmid":"3354256","pubdate":"1988-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Effectiveness and tolerance of pre- and postexposure treatment with purified inactivated rabies vaccine prepared on Vero cell line.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-tolerance-preand-postexposure-treatment-purified-inactivated-rabies-vaccine-prepared-v"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991275,"mean":5.0366419655303,"rank":917010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991275,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124392,"mean":9.0196468951991,"rank":37581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124392,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2717,"mean":4.9016354933726,"rank":641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2717,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":6.9617402597403,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
