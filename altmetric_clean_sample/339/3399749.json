By single-stranded conformational polymorphism typing, verified by sequencing, 19 HLA-DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 haplotypes and 15 HLA-DRB1, seven DQA1 and 11 DQB1 alleles were found. The most frequent alleles were DRB1*1301 (23.5%), DQA1*0103 (29.4%), *0501\/03\/05 (29.4%), and DQB1*0301\/09 (32.4%) in the Ket, and DRB1*0901 (25%), DQA1*0301 (39.6%), and DQB1*0301\/09 (37.5%) in the Nganasan. The distribution patterns and comprehensive phylogenic analysis based on the haplotype frequencies of 17 Siberian populations suggest that the founders of both the Ket and the Nganasan came from Palaeolithic populations in the Altai-Sayan Upland.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002837","authors":["Uinuk-Ool TS","Takezaki N","Derbeneva OA","Volodko NV","Sukernik RI"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T15:58:06+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"European Journal of Immunogenetics","last_mentioned_on":1212771326,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15009181"],"pmid":"15009181","pubdate":"2004-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["genetics","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Variation of HLA class II genes in the Nganasan and Ket, two aboriginal Siberian populations.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/variation-hla-class-ii-genes-nganasan-ket-two-aboriginal-siberian-populations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94160,"mean":8.0973804097327,"rank":24424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94160,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.8255813953488,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
