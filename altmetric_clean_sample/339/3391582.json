To date, three cases of pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery with hemosuccus pancreaticus have been reported in the literature. We describe a case of a pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery proper, which ruptured into a pancreatic pseudocyst communicating with the pancreatic duct, and which was the cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This case was successfully managed by resection of both the pseudoaneurysm and the pancreatic pseudocyst.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9373cf058f61000deca","authors":["L Fernandez-Cruz","M Pera","A Vilella","J M Llovera","M Navasa","J Teres"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T11:37:48+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0172-6390"],"issue":"2","journal":"Hepato gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1212266915,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1634182"],"pmid":"1634182","pubdate":"1992-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Hemosuccus pancreaticus from a pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery proper in a patient with a pancreatic pseudocyst.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hemosuccus-pancreaticus-pseudoaneurysm-hepatic-artery-proper-patient-pancreatic-pseudocyst"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626012,"mean":4.9497445252532,"rank":817633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2284784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626012,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93331,"mean":7.9016811100397,"rank":24028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93331,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303,"mean":0.96145033112583,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
