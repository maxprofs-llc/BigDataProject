We assessed the predictors of hyperkalemia risk following hypertension control using aldosterone blockade in the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: A total of 6,575 patients with hypertension treated between January 1, 2000, and November 30, 2012, were evaluated for the safety of an aldosterone-blocking agent (spironolactone) added to preexisting blood pressure-lowering regimens. Hyperkalemia was defined as a serum potassium level \u22655.0 mEq\/l. All patients used 3 mechanistically complementary antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic and a RAAS blocker. Patients were evaluated after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The incidence of hyperkalemia, significant renal dysfunction [a reduction of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \u226530%], and adverse effects was assessed. Results: The incidence of hyperkalemia in the presence or absence of CKD was 50.4 and 42.6% after 4 weeks (p = 0.001) and 3.8 and 3.0% after 8 weeks, respectively (p = 0.371). A logistic regression analysis revealed that medication, CKD, basal hyperkalemia, reduction in eGFR, and diabetes were all predictive of a hyperkalemia risk following spironolactone use. Conclusion: Spironolactone was well tolerated by selected CKD patients. The risk of serious hyperkalemia or a significant reduction of eGFR appears to be low. Strict monitoring over the first month of treatment followed by standard surveillance for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers is suggested. \u00a9 2015 S.
