They play a pathologic role in inflammatory and fibrosing diseases such as nephrosclerosis. TGF-beta s are secreted in a latent form due to noncovalent association with latency associated peptide (LAP), which is a homodimer formed from the propeptide region of TGF-beta. LAP is disulfide linked to another protein, latent TGF-beta binding protein (LTBP). LTBP has features in common with extracellular matrix proteins, and targets latent TGF-beta to the matrix. Activation of latent TGF-beta can be accomplished in vitro by denaturing treatments, plasmin digestion, ionizing radiation and interaction with thrombospondin. The mechanisms by which latent TGF-beta is activated physiologically are not well understood. Results to date suggest an important role for proteases, particularly plasmin, although other mechanisms probably exist. A general model of activation is proposed in which latent TGF-beta is released from the extracellular matrix by proteases, localized to cell surfaces, and activated by cell-associated plasmin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fb9","authors":["J S Munger","J G Harpel","P E Gleizes","R Mazzieri","I Nunes","D B Rifkin"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T12:25:23+00:00","issns":["0085-2538"],"issue":"5","journal":"Kidney International","last_mentioned_on":1198548578,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9150447"],"pmid":"9150447","pubdate":"1997-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Latent transforming growth factor-beta: structural features and mechanisms of activation.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/latent-transforming-growth-factor%CE%B2-structural-features-mechanisms-activation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4683775,"mean":5.7027612822493,"rank":1131542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2963723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4683775,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162326,"mean":8.8996536947484,"rank":48077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":112080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162326,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1878,"mean":3.7944219499201,"rank":523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":1083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1878,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":10.856861111111,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
