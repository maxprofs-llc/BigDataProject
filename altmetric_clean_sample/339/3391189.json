Ten patients (group M) were administered milrinone (50 microg\/kg) after aortic declamping during CPB, 10 patients were administered amrinone (1 mg\/kg) at the same time during their surgery (group A), and 10 patients served as controls with no drug administered (group C). Soon after bolus infusion of the PDE III inhibitor, perfusion pressure dropped significantly in groups M and A. However, after release of CPB and at the end of surgery, there was no difference in aortic pressure between the 3 groups. There were also no differences between the groups in heart rate, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. After weaning from CPB, the cardiac index was high and systemic vascular resistance index was low in groups M and A. There were no significant differences in the need for additional catecholamines and time for rewarming between groups. No adverse reactions were observed. A single administration of a PDE III inhibitor during CPB was useful for post-CPB management of patients undergoing open heart surgery. Amrinone reduced perfusion pressures more than milrinone, but cardiac indices and aortic pressures after weaning from CPB showed no differences between group M and group A patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000cdb0","authors":["Y Hamada","K Kawachi","T Yamamoto","T Nakata","Y Kashu","M Sato","Y Watanabe"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T11:28:03+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0047-1828"],"issue":"8","journal":"Japanese circulation journal","last_mentioned_on":1223426344,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10478810"],"pmid":"10478810","pubdate":"1999-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Effects of single administration of a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor during cardiopulmonary bypass: comparison of milrinone and amrinone.","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-single-administration-phosphodiesterase-iii-inhibitor-during-cardiopulmonary-bypass-comparis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":816262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94050,"mean":8.0916511605655,"rank":24374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94050,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.1428571428571,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
