Cloning of full-length cDNAs revealed that EHSH1 is composed of an N-terminal region with two EH domains, a central region that is enriched in lysine, leucine, glutamate, arginine, and glutamine (KLERQ domain), and a C-terminal region comprised of five SH3 domains. The third SH3 domain is alternatively spliced. Data bank searches demonstrated that EHSH1 is very similar to Xenopus and human intersectins and to human SH3P17. In addition, we identified expressed sequence tags that encode a second isoform of EHSH1, called EHSH2. EHSH1 is abundantly expressed in brain and at lower levels in all other tissues tested. In binding studies, we found that the central KLERQ domain of EHSH1 binds to recombinant or native brain SNAP-25 and SNAP-23. The C-terminal SH3 domains, by contrast, quantitatively interact with dynamin, a protein involved in endocytosis. Dynamin strongly binds to the alternatively spliced central SH3 domain (SH3C) and the two C-terminal SH3 domains (SH3D and SH3E) but not to the N-terminal SH3 domains (SH3A and SH3B). Immunoprecipitations confirmed that both dynamin and SNAP-25 are complexed to EHSH1 in brain. Our data suggest that EHSH1\/intersectin may be a novel adaptor protein that couples endocytic membrane traffic to exocytosis. The ability of multiple SH3 domains in EHSH1 to bind to dynamin suggests that EHSH1 can cluster several dynamin molecules in a manner that is regulated by alternative splicing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Masaya Okamoto","Susanne Schoch","Thomas C.
