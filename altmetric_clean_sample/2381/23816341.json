The samples were analysed fresh and after 4-years of storage (at 25 \u00b0C and protected from light). The hydroxymethylfurfural content and diastase activity of the fresh samples were in accordance with the recommended values described in the legislation. In general, the antioxidant activity of the samples correlated more with the bioactive compounds content than with colour. The storage affected differently each individual sample, especially regarding the antioxidant profile. Nevertheless, although in general the lightness of the samples decreased (and the redness increased), after 4 years, 11 samples still presented acceptable diastase activity and hydroxymethylfurfural values.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Sonia Soares","Diana Pinto","Francisca Rodrigues","Rita C.
