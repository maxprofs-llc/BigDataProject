The live birth rate (LBR) was 78.9%. Preterm birth (<37 weeks) occurred in 56.5%. Hypertensive disorders affected 76% of women (pre-eclampsia in 30%). Median pre-pregnancy serum creatinine (SCr) was 100 umol\/L (interquartile range IQR 80,114 umol\/L). One third had deterioration in graft dysfunction during pregnancy; of these 63.2% did not return to baseline. At 2 years post-partum mean serum creatinine was 145\u00b124umol\/L. Women with pre-pregnancy SCr >110umol\/L had increased risk of pre-eclampsia (OR 4.4; 95% CI 1.2-16.8; p=0.03), preterm birth (OR 5.4; 95% CI 0.5-53; p = 0.04) and low birth-weight babies (OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.5-2.9; p = 0.04). Women with SCr >140mol\/L preconception had worst SCr trajectory, including higher rates of graft loss.\nKT pregnancies remain at high risk of obstetric complications, particularly pre-eclampsia. Pre-pregnancy graft function can be used to predict risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and deterioration in graft function during and after delivery. This article is protected by copyright.
