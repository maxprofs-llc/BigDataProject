Preoperative and postoperative morbidity and functional outcomes were analyzed. Actuarial recurrence rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nA total of 108 VRs were performed during the study period. Seventy-two were primary and 36 repeat repairs. Seven cases were\u00a0open, 23 laparoscopic, and 78 robotic. Six cases were converted from laparoscopic\/robotic to open. In 63 patients, VR was combined with gynecological procedures. There were no statistical differences between primary or recurrent prolapse for the following: demographics, operative time, concomitant gynecologic procedures, complications, blood loss, and graft material type. Length of stay was longer in patients with a history of prior prolapse surgery (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Prolapse recurrence rates for primary repairs were reported at 1.4, 6.9, and 9.7% and for recurrent prolapse procedures 13.9, 25, and 25% at 1, 3, and 5\u00a0years (p\u00a0=\u00a00.13). Mean length of follow-up was similar between groups. Time to recurrence was significantly shorter in patients undergoing repeat prolapse surgery 8.8 vs 30.7\u00a0months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).\nVR is a better option for patients undergoing primary rectal prolapse repair.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b2e","authors":["Brooke Gurland","Maria Emilia Carvalho e Carvalho","Beri Ridgeway","Marie Fidela R.
