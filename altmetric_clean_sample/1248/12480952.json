The phaco tip is the only surgical instrument required for this technique. Its advantages include maintaining a stable intraocular pressure during cortical cleaving hydrodissection and lens removal, which includes the cortex.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f15","authors":["Yoichiro Masuda","Kotaro Oki","Hisaharu Iwaki","Toshinori Okamoto","Hiroshi Tsuneoka"],"doi":"10.2147\/opth.s117588","first_seen_on":"2016-10-07T03:53:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-5467"],"journal":"Clinical Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1475812373,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/use-of-the-phaco-tip-technique-for-lens-cleavage-and-removal-during-ca-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=32823","pmid":"27784980","pubdate":"2016-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","title":"Use of the phaco tip technique for lens cleavage and removal during cataract surgery","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phaco-tip-technique-lens-cleavage-removal-during-cataract-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7499955,"mean":6.4950193838481,"rank":5676249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1003711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7499955,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240289,"mean":12.551738255759,"rank":168098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":41809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240289,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1216,"mean":2.1574617283951,"rank":678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1216,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":5.2739130434783,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
