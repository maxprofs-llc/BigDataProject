In 1819, he was a co-founder, and for 20 years secretary, of the Hunterian Society which continues to provide education to its members. He was the author of several books where his views on the importance of post-mortem examinations and the interrelationships of body and mind in disease were discussed. He was a prominent non-conformist and became a deacon in the Congregational Church. He died in 1873, aged 87.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001cf7","authors":["Peter Selley"],"doi":"10.1177\/0967772015622630","first_seen_on":"2016-10-07T09:12:29+00:00","issns":["1758-1087"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Biography","last_mentioned_on":1475831534,"links":["http:\/\/jmb.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/10\/0967772015622630.full.pdf?ijkey=HXpxvE5rlUwQjaG&keytype=finite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jmb.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/10\/0967772015622630.full.pdf","pmid":"26691432","pubdate":"2015-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Historical Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","historyofmedicine"],"title":"William Cooke MD MRCS (1785-1873) - General Practitioner, Founder of the Hunterian Society and Deacon of the Congregational Church","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7499955,"mean":6.4950193838481,"rank":3866337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2099225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7499955,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240290,"mean":12.551585723857,"rank":131797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":84329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240290,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220,"mean":3.5325570776256,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.1753333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HunterianSoc\/statuses\/784320417783656448","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12484467],"posted_on":"2016-10-07T09:12:14+00:00","author":{"name":"John Hunter","url":"http:\/\/www.hunteriansociety.org.uk\/index.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/689236447279341568\/TMCdZFCA_normal.jpg","description":"The Hunterian Society, one of the oldest in England, was founded in 1819 by William Cooke, GP and Mr. Thomas Armiger, surgeon, in the City and east  of London.","id_on_source":"HunterianSoc","tweeter_id":"4824996113","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":31},"tweet_id":"784320417783656448"}]}}
