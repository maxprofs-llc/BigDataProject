The BDHS 2011 data sets were analysed to identify the determinants of health facility-based deliveries and caesarean sections. A total of 2813 adolescent girls (aged 10-19\u2005years) were included for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed.\nHealth facility-based deliveries have continuously increased among adolescents in Bangladesh over the past two decades from 3% in 1993-1994 to 24.5% in 2011. Rates of population-based and facility-based caesarean sections have increased linearly among all age groups of women including adolescents. Although the country's overall (population-based) caesarean section rate among adolescents was within acceptable range (11.6%), a rate of nearly 50% health facility level caesarean sections among adolescent girls is alarming. Among adolescent girls, use of antenatal care (ANC) appeared to be the most important predictor of health facility-based delivery (OR: 4.04; 95% CI 2.73 to 5.99), whereas the wealth index appeared as the most important predictor of caesarean sections (OR: 5.7; 95% CI 2.74 to 12.1).\nMaternal health-related interventions should be more targeted towards adolescent girls in order to encourage them to access ANC and promote health facility-based delivery. Rising trends of caesarean sections require further investigation on indication and provider-client-related determinants of these interventions among adolescent girls in Bangladesh.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["A S M Shahabuddin","Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Delvaux","Bettina Utz","Azucena Bardaj\u00ed","Vincent De Brouwere"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-012424","first_seen_on":"2016-10-07T04:55:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"9","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1476187891,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/9\/e012424?utm_content=bufferbc978&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/9\/e012424.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/9\/e012424.full.pdf","pmid":"27633641","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e012424","title":"Determinants and trends in health facility-based deliveries and caesarean sections among married adolescent girls in Bangladesh","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determinants-trends-health-facilitybased-deliveries-caesarean-sections-among-married-adolescent-girl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":3407869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4085832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240717,"mean":12.551595830771,"rank":110929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":128319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240717,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5255,"mean":16.821542443852,"rank":3437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5255,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":28.55868115942,"rank":275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
