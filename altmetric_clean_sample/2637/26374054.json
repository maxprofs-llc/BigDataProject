Here the extended chemical shift anisotropy amplification (xCSA) method is applied for amide proton CSA measurement in uniformly (2)H enriched proteins under fast magic angle spinning. The xCSA method is capable of distinguishing the sign of the CSA asymmetry parameter, complimenting other multiple-pulse recoupling methods. A three-dimensional xCSA experiment is demonstrated for measuring the proton CSA of amide sites in aGB1 protein sample and the possible correlation of amide proton CSA with protein secondary structure is discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e26","authors":["Ge, Yuwei","Hung, Ivan","Liu, Xiaoli","Liu, Maili","Gan, Zhehong","Li, Conggang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmr.2017.09.009","first_seen_on":"2017-09-20T22:31:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1090-7807","10907807","1096-0856"],"journal":"Journal of Magnetic Resonance","last_mentioned_on":1505946649,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1090780717302331"],"pmid":"28957683","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Measurement of amide proton chemical shift anisotropy in perdeuterated proteins using CSA amplification","type":"article","volume":"284","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measurement-amide-proton-chemical-shift-anisotropy-perdeuterated-proteins-using-csa-amplification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440508,"mean":7.0976499018281,"rank":6404352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1147333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440508,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113959,"mean":11.843706628758,"rank":80405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":20815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113959,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":580,"mean":1.6037098445596,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":580,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.12,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
