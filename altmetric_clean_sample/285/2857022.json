The results showed that the most abundant Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) congener from three sites was deca-BDE, and it was penta-BDE for the other site. A significant and positive association was found between BDE-209 and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE). The high percentage of nona-BDE indicated the debromination of deca-BDE during e-waste recycling. The ratio comparison of BDE-47 to (BDE-100\u2009+\u2009BDE-99) indicated that the outdoor dust went through more physiochemical processes. The enrichment factors for Cu and Pb were high in both the indoor and outdoor samples. Cd significantly exceeded the Chinese soil guideline grade III. The PCA results combined with the enrichment factor (EF) values suggested common sources and behaviours of Cu, Pb and Sb in the indoor dust. Co, Cr, Ni, Zn and Mn in the outdoor samples were more likely affected by crust. Strong correlations were found only for Pb and Sb with polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The hazard index for on-site human exposure to Pb was at a chronic risk. Despite the low deleterious risk of BFRs, concern should be given to DBDPE; the chronic toxicity of which is not known.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Feng Xu","Yangcheng Liu","Junxia Wang","Gang Zhang","Wei Zhang","Lili Liu","Jinfu Wang","Bishu Pan","Kuangfei Lin"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11356-014-3773-z","first_seen_on":"2014-11-06T16:03:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1614-7499"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Pollution Research","last_mentioned_on":1415289728,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25369920"],"pmid":"25369920","pubdate":"2014-11-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Characterization of heavy metals and brominated flame retardants in the indoor and outdoor dust of e-waste workshops: implication for on-site human exposure.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-heavy-metals-brominated-flame-retardants-indoor-outdoor-dust-ewaste-workshops-impli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4475808,"mean":4.7807918521955,"rank":3446744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":132553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4475808,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125759,"mean":7.5669105583741,"rank":93252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125759,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":949,"mean":1.9128670886076,"rank":556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":949,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":1.4761123595506,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
