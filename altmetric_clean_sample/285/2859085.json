Pregnancy physiology may predispose to sleep disruption but may also result in worsening of some underlying sleep disorders, and the de novo development of others. Apart from sleep disordered breathing, the impact of sleep disorders on pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes is poorly understood. In this article, we review the literature and discuss available data pertaining to the most common sleep disorders in perinatal women. These include restless legs syndrome, insomnia, circadian pattern disturbances, narcolepsy, and sleep-disordered breathing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005814","doi":"10.1016\/j.ccm.2014.06.012","first_seen_on":"2014-11-06T22:13:29+00:00","issns":["02725231"],"journal":"Clinics in chest medicine","last_mentioned_on":1423694900,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0272523114000501"],"pmid":"25156772","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Sleep Disorders in Pregnancy ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sleep-disorders-pregnancy-19"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4747790,"mean":5.7056333468087,"rank":2522299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1578847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4747790,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133579,"mean":8.8853713186305,"rank":69498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":48482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133579,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":2.0599770114943,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.675,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
