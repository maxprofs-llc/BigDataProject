Though recent research in the area has provided many mechanistic revelations, a basic-level understanding of kinetic and substrate tolerability is still needed before the full potential of combinatorial biosynthesis can be realized. We have developed a novel set of chemical probes for the study of ketoreductase domains of polyketide synthases. This chemical tool-based approach was validated using the ketoreductase of pikromycin module 2 (PikKR2) as a model system. Triketide substrate mimics 12 and 13 were designed to increase stability (incorporating a nonhydrolyzable thioether linkage) and minimize nonessential functionality (truncating the phosphopantetheinyl arm). PikKR2 reduction product identities as well as steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by a combination of LC-MS\/MS analysis of synthetic standards and a NADPH consumption assay. The d-hydroxyl product is consistent with bioinformatic analysis and results from a complementary biochemical and molecular biological approach. When compared to widely employed substrates in previous studies, diketide 63 and trans-decalone 64, substrates 12 and 13 showed 2-10 fold lower KM values (2.4 \u00b1 0.8 and 7.8 \u00b1 2.7 mM, respectively), indicating molecular recognition of intermediate-like substrates. Due to an abundance of the nonreducable enol-tautomer, the kcat values were attenuated by as much as 15-336 fold relative to known substrates. This study reveals the high stereoselectivity of PikKR2 in the face of gross substrate permutation, highlighting the utility of a chemical probe-based approach in the study of polyketide ketoreductases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006811","authors":["Yang Li","Li Y","Fiers WD","Bernard SM","Smith JL","Aldrich CC","Fecik RA"],"doi":"10.1021\/cb5006883","first_seen_on":"2014-11-06T16:50:39+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1554-8929"],"journal":"ACS Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1440576543,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/cb5006883","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25299319?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25299319","pubdate":"2014-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","biochemistry"],"title":"Polyketide Intermediate Mimics as Probes for Revealing Cryptic Stereochemistry of Ketoreductase Domains.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polyketide-intermediate-mimics-probes-revealing-cryptic-stereochemistry-ketoreductase-domains"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5552412,"mean":6.3816992845073,"rank":3683604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1637868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5552412,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157683,"mean":8.6561730952171,"rank":98814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":51587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157683,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1294,"mean":4.0255112142305,"rank":835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1294,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":3.4658913043478,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
