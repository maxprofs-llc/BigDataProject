In this study, we observed that an overexpression of microspherule protein 1 (MCRS1) promotes the invasion and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Furthermore, we sought to systematically investigate the pathophysiological functions and related mechanisms of MCRS1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000873","doi":"10.1186\/1476-4598-13-245","first_seen_on":"2014-11-06T18:19:58+00:00","issns":["1476-4598"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1417688118,"links":["http:\/\/www.molecular-cancer.com\/content\/13\/1\/245\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25373388?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.molecular-cancer.com\/content\/13\/1\/245"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molecular-cancer.com\/content\/pdf\/1476-4598-13-245.pdf","pmid":"25373388","pubdate":"2014-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"245","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MCRS1 overexpression, which is specifically inhibited by miR-129*, promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mcrs1-overexpression-specifically-inhibited-mir129-promotes-epithelialmesenchymal-transition-metasta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2006383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2992959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145402,"mean":8.7412837050642,"rank":50581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":93159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145402,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":605,"mean":3.0755132450331,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":605,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.7337837837838,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
