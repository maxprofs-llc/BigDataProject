Between January 2005 and July 2012, 21 patients underwent treatment of proximal hypospadias using a modified hypospadias repair. The procedure involved making a U-incision similar to that in a Thiersch-Duplay repair to preserve the blood supply to the tubular neourethra. The neourethra was reconstructed by island penile skin. An M-incision was made in the glans, and the meatus was attached to tip of glans. Flaps were harvested from both sides of the penis preventing postoperative penile turn. Cosmetic and functional, long-term (mean, 12 months) recovery was excellent. Complications consisted of 3 cases of urethrocutaneous fistula (14.2%), which were corrected surgically, and 2 cases of penile skin necrosis. There were no instances of meatal stenosis, diverticulum, or urethral stricture. Bifid scrotum was present in 6 patients, and associated penoscrotal transposition was present in 15 patients. Both of these associated defects were corrected at the time of surgery. The modified technique permits 1-stage repair of proximal hypospadias with a low complication rate, the satisfactory recovery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a2c","authors":["Chen, Yuhong","Zhang, Jinming","Ji, Chenyang","Liang, Weiqiang","Pan, Shujuan","Wu, Biying"],"doi":"10.1097\/sap.0000000000000345","first_seen_on":"2014-11-06T23:15:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0148-7043","1536-3708"],"issue":"6","journal":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1465032126,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Modification_of_the_Koyanagi_Technique_for_the.98346.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Abstract\/2016\/06000\/Modification_of_the_Koyanagi_Technique_for_the.17.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Modification_of_the_Koyanagi_Technique_for_the.98346.pdf","pmid":"27176562","pubdate":"2014-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Modification of the Koyanagi Technique for the Single-Stage Repair of Proximal Hypospadias.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Fulltext\/2016\/06000\/Modification_of_the_Koyanagi_Technique_for_the.17.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modification-koyanagi-technique-single-stage-repair-proximal-hypospadias"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7851688,"mean":6.6523167403332,"rank":6800624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7851688,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203114,"mean":7.8275198928677,"rank":163341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203114,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2381,"mean":1.3863722689076,"rank":956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2381,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":0.91549367088608,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
