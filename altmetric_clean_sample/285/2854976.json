Here we report a Shh-induced epigenetic switch that cooperates with Gli to control transcription outcomes. Before induction, poised Shh target genes are marked by a bivalent chromatin domain containing a repressive histone H3K27me3 mark and an active H3K4me3 mark. Shh activation induces a local switch of epigenetic cofactors from the H3K27 methyltransferase polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to an H3K27me3 demethylase Jmjd3\/Kdm6b-centred coactivator complex. We also find that non-enzymatic activities of Jmjd3 are important and that Jmjd3 recruits the Set1\/MLL H3K4 methyltransferase complexes in a Shh-dependent manner to resolve the bivalent domain. In vivo, changes of the bivalent domain accompanied Shh-activated cerebellar progenitor proliferation. Overall, our results reveal a regulatory mechanism that underlies the activation of Shh target genes and provides insight into the causes of various diseases and cancers exhibiting altered Shh signalling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Xuanming Shi","Zilai Zhang","Xiaoming Zhan","Mou Cao","Takashi Satoh","Shizuo Akira","Karl Shpargel","Terry Magnuson","Qingtian Li","Rongfu Wang","Chaochen Wang","Kai Ge","Jiang Wu","Shi X","Zhang Z","Zhan X","Cao M","Satoh T","Akira S","Shpargel K","Magnuson T","Li Q","Wang R","Wang C","Ge K","Wu J"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms6425","first_seen_on":"2014-11-06T11:30:33+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["2041-1733","2041-1723",""],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1489695808,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ncomms6425","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25370275?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25370275?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ncomms6425"],"pmid":"25370275","pubdate":"2014-11-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"5425","title":"An epigenetic switch induced by Shh signalling regulates gene activation during development and medulloblastoma growth.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ncomms6425","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-switch-induced-shh-signalling-regulates-gene-activation-during-development-medulloblastom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":3968612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4211811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205776,"mean":8.0335570210183,"rank":84199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":115013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205776,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13064,"mean":44.671580953839,"rank":10212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":2539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13064,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":610,"mean":36.477238095238,"rank":495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":610,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
