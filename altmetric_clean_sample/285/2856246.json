Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) found within the HCT graft are believed to be partially responsible for this amelioration, in part due to their intrinsic immunomodulatory and trophic properties and also because they have been shown to restore C7 protein following intradermal injections in models of RDEB. However, MSCs have not yet been demonstrated to improve disease severity as a stand-alone systemic infusion therapy. Improving the efficacy and functional utility of MSCs via a pre-transplant conditioning regimen may bring systemic MSC infusions closer to clinical practice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b6","authors":["Perdoni C","McGrath JA","Tolar J"],"doi":"10.1186\/scrt511","first_seen_on":"2014-11-06T14:02:41+00:00","funders":["niams"],"issns":["1757-6512"],"issue":"6","journal":"Stem Cell Research & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1447178174,"links":["http:\/\/stemcellres.com\/content\/5\/6\/121\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25376815?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/stemcellres.com\/content\/pdf\/scrt511.pdf","pmid":"25376815","pubdate":"2014-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"121","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Preconditioning of mesenchymal stem cells for improved transplantation efficacy in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preconditioning-mesenchymal-stem-cells-improved-transplantation-efficacy-recessive-dystrophic-epider-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6554440,"mean":6.0725058611419,"rank":2310229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4207238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6554440,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172480,"mean":8.3761824338037,"rank":58128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":112977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172480,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":517,"mean":4.5567093023256,"rank":207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":517,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":13.828740740741,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
