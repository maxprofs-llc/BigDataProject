Whereas some studies infer a role of professional APCs present in the lymph nodes draining the site of parasite injection by the mosquito, others argue in favor of the liver as a primary organ and hepatocytes as stimulators of na\u00efve parasite-specific T cell responses. This review aims to critically analyze the current knowledge and outline new lines of research necessary to understand the induction of protective cellular immunity against the malaria parasite.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Corradin, Giampietro","Levitskaya, Jelena"],"doi":"10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00527","first_seen_on":"2014-11-07T01:00:41+00:00","issns":["1664-3224"],"journal":"Frontiers in immunology","last_mentioned_on":1416715444,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00527\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25414698?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00527\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4220712","pmid":"25414698","pubdate":"2014-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Priming of CD8+ T Cell Responses to Liver Stage Malaria Parasite Antigens","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/priming-cd8-t-cell-responses-liver-stage-malaria-parasite-antigens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6414558,"mean":5.8727681702736,"rank":4740005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":950101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6414558,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159839,"mean":8.7061252142796,"rank":107795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":32200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159839,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2351,"mean":1.9594365957447,"rank":1553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2351,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":3.0447532467532,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
