The evolution of receptors for self major histocompatibility complex-I and stress-induced ligands also bestows upon NK cells an important effector role in the clearance of virus-infected and transformed cells. NK cells are dependent on the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin (IL)-15 for their development, differentiation and optimal function. Here I review the regulation of IL-15 in vivo, its role in driving NK cell differentiation and discuss the function of NK cell diversification with regard to innate immunity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a9a","authors":["Huntington ND"],"doi":"10.1038\/icb.2014.1","first_seen_on":"2014-11-06T11:14:19+00:00","issns":["0818-9641","1440-1711"],"issue":"3","journal":"Immunology & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1415342465,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24492800?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24492800","pubdate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The unconventional expression of IL-15 and its role in NK cell homeostasis.","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unconventional-expression-il15-role-nk-cell-homeostasis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4478505,"mean":4.7770715355304,"rank":3447047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":132641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4478505,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125808,"mean":7.5593233285907,"rank":93002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125808,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":451,"mean":4.0014622222222,"rank":358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":451,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":7.7173076923077,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
