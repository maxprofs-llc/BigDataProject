We report on the use of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy in the treatment of late deep infections after open Achilles tendon reconstruction. Six patients (5 males [83.33%], 1 female [16.67%]; mean age, 52.8 [range 37 to 66] years) were been treated using an identical protocol. Surgical management consisted of debridement, lavage, and necrectomy of infected tendon parts. The VAC therapy was used for local wound preconditioning and infection management. A continuous negative pressure of 125\u00a0mm Hg was applied on each wound. For final wound closure, a split-thickness skin graft was performed. The skin graft healing process was also supported by VAC therapy during the first 5 days. The VAC dressings were changed a mean average of 3 (range 1 to 4) times until split-thickness skin grafting could be performed. The mean total duration of the VAC therapy was 13.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9\u00a0days. The mean hospital stay was 31.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.9\u00a0days. No complications with regard to bleeding, seroma, or hematoma formation beneath the skin graft were observed. At a mean follow-up duration of 29.9 (range 4 to 65) months, no re-infection or infection persistence was observed. The VAC device seems to be a valuable tool in the treatment of infected tendons. The generalization of these conclusions should await the results of future studies with larger patient series.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a39","authors":["Mosser P","Kelm J","Anagnostakos K"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.jfas.2014.09.040","first_seen_on":"2014-11-05T02:44:55+00:00","issns":["1067-2516"],"journal":"Journal of Foot & Ankle Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1439460584,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?code=yjfas-site&rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfas.org%2Farticle%2FS1067-2516%252814%252900489-X%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes","http:\/\/www.jfas.org\/article\/S1067-2516(14)00489-X\/abstract?rss=yes","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfas.org%2Farticle%2FS1067-2516%252814%252900489-X%2Fabstract&code=yjfas-site","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25451209?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jfas.org\/article\/S106725161400489X\/pdf","pmid":"25451209","pubdate":"2014-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Negative Pressure Wound Therapy in the Management of Late Deep Infections After Open Reconstruction of Achilles Tendon Rupture.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/negative-pressure-wound-therapy-management-late-deep-infections-after-open-reconstruction-achilles-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5480984,"mean":6.3651475448834,"rank":1162557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":4310627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5480984,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156325,"mean":8.7179332284233,"rank":38777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":117245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156325,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316,"mean":2.7726984126984,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.825,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
