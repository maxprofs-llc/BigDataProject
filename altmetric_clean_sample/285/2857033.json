In recent years, however, there has been increasing recognition of the interconnectivity between the various systems, such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, erectile dysfunction and prostate cancer. This constellation of disease\/syndrome and dysfunction may place urologists at the centre of men's overall health concerns. As urologists considering taking on a leadership role in men's health, they should also consider their potential in helping men suffering from the significant burden of a mental health disorder. Urologists may have a unique opportunity to identify mental health issues in their male patients, influence healthy behaviour change, and successfully refer men, who might otherwise not seek help, to appropriate medical\/psychological care.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5203cf058f610003a27","authors":["Andrew Matthew","Dean Elterman"],"doi":"10.5489\/cuaj.2312","first_seen_on":"2014-11-06T16:06:42+00:00","issns":["1911-6470"],"issue":"7-8 Suppl 5","journal":"Canadian Urological Association Journal","last_mentioned_on":1415291796,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4145705\/?report=classic"],"pmcid":"PMC4145705","pmid":"25243041","pubdate":"2014-07-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Canadian Medical Association","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S153","title":"Men\u2019s mental health: Connection to urologic health","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mens-mental-health-connection-urologic-health"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2088178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2380938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126307,"mean":8.5144792963123,"rank":55205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":70063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126307,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170,"mean":2.4886153846154,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.935,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShepellConnect\/status\/530390496150310912","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2857033],"posted_on":"2014-11-06T16:05:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Shepell Clinical","url":"http:\/\/www.shepell.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528185539019558912\/AvtLVZmJ_normal.jpeg","description":"Information for Shepell counsellors & followers with an interest in #mentalhealth #endstigma #digital #research http:\/\/workhealthlife.com","id_on_source":"ShepellConnect","tweeter_id":"412329832","geo":{"lt":60.10867,"ln":-113.64258,"country":"CA"},"followers":2194},"tweet_id":"530390496150310912"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MotherUnadorned\/status\/530398353029623808","license":"datasift","rt":["ShepellConnect"],"citation_ids":[2857033],"posted_on":"2014-11-06T16:36:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Cristi Comes","url":"http:\/\/lifeunadorned.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/773546588874559488\/u-vDLW_t_normal.jpg","description":"#Family #Food #SelfCare #Travel #Geekery Influencer | Writer | Photographer | PR cristicomes@gmail.com","id_on_source":"MotherUnadorned","tweeter_id":"154390354","geo":{"lt":47.60621,"ln":-122.33207,"country":"US"},"followers":15567},"tweet_id":"530398353029623808"}]}}
