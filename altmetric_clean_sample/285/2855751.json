In this review, we focus on the central role that disturbed sleep and daytime sleepiness occupies in interactions involving substance abuse and negative health, social, and emotional outcomes. As a means of improving sleep and lowering risk for recidivism of substance abuse, we developed and implemented a six-session group treatment to treat sleep disturbances in adolescents who have received treatment for substance abuse. The components of the treatment are stimulus control instructions, use of bright light to regularize sleep, sleep hygiene education, cognitive therapy, and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. Preliminary evidence indicates that participants who completed four or more sessions in the treatment program showed improved sleep and that improving sleep may lead to a reduction in substance abuse problems at the 12-month follow-up.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002575","authors":["Bootzin RR","Stevens SJ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cpr.2005.04.007","endpage":"644","first_seen_on":"2014-11-06T12:58:22+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["02727358","0272-7358"],"issue":"5","journal":"Clinical Psychology Review","last_mentioned_on":1475020936,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0272735805000334"],"pmid":"15953666","pubdate":"2005-07-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"629","title":"Adolescents, substance abuse, and the treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness ","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adolescents-substance-abuse-treatment-insomnia-daytime-sleepiness-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":661294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7781962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206092,"mean":8.0509720463292,"rank":20009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":185975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206092,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":909,"mean":12.061004405286,"rank":199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":909,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":10.892857142857,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Doctoral Student":18,"Student  > Ph.
