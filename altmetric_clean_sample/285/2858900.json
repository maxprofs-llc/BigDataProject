The powdered plant was extracted by the method of cold maceration using aqueous ethanol (70:30) as solvents. Analgesic activity was assessed by Eddy's hot plate method, formalin-induced paw licking and acetic acid-induced writhing in mice. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by carageenan-induced mice paw edema. The anti-pyretic activity was determined by yeast-induced pyrexia in mice. The aqueous ethanolic extract of Tamarix aphylla showed 42% inhibition (p<0.005) of acetic acid- induced writhing, 63% reduction (p<0.005) in formalin-induced paw licking, and 42% increase (p<0.05) in reaction time as compared to normal control. The extract did not show significant anti-inflammatory activity. However, it showed significant antipyretic effect (p<0.005). The results of this study demonstrate that aqueous ethanolic extract of Tamarix aphylla exhibit analgesic and antipyretic activity but lacks anti-inflammatory activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6a13cf058f610009a10","authors":["Muhammad Imran Qadir","Khizar Abbas","Rahma Hamayun","Muhammad Ali","Qadir MI","Abbas K","Hamayun R","Ali M"],"first_seen_on":"2014-11-06T21:28:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1011-601X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Pakistan Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1467749305,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25362598?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25362598"],"pmid":"25362598","pubdate":"2014-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Report: Analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic activities of aqueous ethanolic extract of Tamarix aphylla L.
