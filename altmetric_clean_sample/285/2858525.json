In response to tissue injury, circulating platelet-neutrophil aggregates form to augment neutrophil tissue entry. These early cellular events in acute inflammation are pivotal to timely resolution by mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. Here, we identified a previously undescribed biosynthetic route during human platelet-neutrophil interactions for the proresolving mediator maresin 1 (MaR1; 7R,14S-dihydroxy-docosa-4Z,8E,10E,12Z,16Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid). Docosahexaenoic acid was converted by platelet 12-lipoxygenase to 13S,14S-epoxy-maresin, which was further transformed by neutrophils to MaR1. In a murine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, lipid mediator metabololipidomics uncovered MaR1 generation in vivo in a temporally regulated manner. Early MaR1 production was dependent on platelet-neutrophil interactions, and intravascular MaR1 was organ-protective, leading to decreased lung neutrophils, edema, tissue hypoxia, and prophlogistic mediators. Together, these findings identify a transcellular route for intravascular maresin 1 biosynthesis via platelet-neutrophil interactions that regulates the extent of lung inflammation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Raja-Elie E Abdulnour","Jesmond Dalli","Jennifer K Colby","Nandini Krishnamoorthy","Jack Y Timmons","Sook Hwa Tan","Romain A Colas","Nicos A Petasis","Charles N Serhan","Bruce D Levy","Abdulnour RE","Dalli J","Colby JK","Krishnamoorthy N","Timmons JY","Tan SH","Colas RA","Petasis NA","Serhan CN","Levy BD","Raja-Elie E.
