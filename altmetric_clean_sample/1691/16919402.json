Bacteria have evolved different strategies to manipulate their host metabolism for their own benefit. This bacterial manipulation is often coupled with severe symptom development or the death of the affected plants. Determining the specific bacterial molecules responsible for the host manipulation has become an important field in microbiological research. After the identification of these bacterial molecules, called \"effectors,\" it is important to elucidate their function. A straightforward approach to determine the function of an effector is to identify its proteinaceous binding partner in its natural host via a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen. Normally the host harbors numerous potential binding partners that cannot be predicted sufficiently by any in silico algorithm. It is thus the best choice to perform a screen with the hypothetical effector against a whole library of expressed host proteins. It is especially challenging if the causative agent is uncultivable like phytoplasma. This protocol provides step-by-step instructions for DNA purification from a phytoplasma-infected woody host plant, the amplification of the potential effector, and the subsequent identification of the plant's molecular interaction partner with a Y2H screen. Even though Y2H screens are commonly used, there is a trend to outsource this technique to biotech companies that offer the Y2H service at a cost. This protocol provides instructions on how to perform a Y2H in any decently equipped molecular biology laboratory using standard lab techniques.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Katrin Janik","Katja Schlink"],"doi":"10.3791\/55150","first_seen_on":"2017-03-02T11:23:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-087X"],"issue":"119","journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1488431695,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28190069"],"pmid":"28190069","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"Unravelling the Function of a Bacterial Effector from a Non-cultivable Plant Pathogen Using a Yeast Two-hybrid Screen","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/55150\/unravelling-function-bacterial-effector-from-non-cultivable-plant","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unravelling-function-bacterial-effector-noncultivable-plant-pathogen-using-yeast-twohybrid-screen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":7173879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242164,"mean":13.706662396815,"rank":201473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242164,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4256,"mean":3.2881851938895,"rank":3241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4256,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":7.2284920634921,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SRamakrishnan_1\/statuses\/837169325278650368","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16919402],"posted_on":"2017-03-02T05:14:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Ramakrishnan","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/746620159561990144\/FMs-T63E_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"SRamakrishnan_1","tweeter_id":"746592973253713921","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16},"tweet_id":"837169325278650368"}]}}
