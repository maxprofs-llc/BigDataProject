Blood lead, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels were evaluated as hematologic parameters, and serum iron concentrations, total iron-binding capacity, and percentage of transferrin saturation were evaluated as iron-status parameters. Dietary iron intake was assessed by a 24-h recall method.\nLead workers had significantly lower hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum iron levels, percentage of transferrin saturation, and dietary iron intake than did non-lead workers, and they had significantly higher (P < 0.01) total iron-binding capacity. The occurrence of iron-deficiency cases, as assessed by hematocrit values, was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in lead workers than in non-lead workers, and the prevalence of iron deficiency was associated with high blood lead levels (P = 0.033). The dietary iron intake was inversely associated with zinc protoporphyrin (P = 0.032).\nThis study confirmed the adverse effects of high blood lead levels on hematologic pathways and the effectiveness of dietary iron intake as a secondary preventive intervention against lead toxicity. To promote health and to prevent toxic effects of lead exposure in Korean lead workers, an adequate intake of dietary iron is strongly recommended.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f610003215","authors":["Hee-Seon Kim","Sung-Soo Lee","Young Hwangbo","Kyu-Dong Ahn","Byung-Kook Lee"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0899-9007(03)00035-2","first_seen_on":"2017-03-02T11:08:28+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["08999007","0899-9007"],"issue":"7-8","journal":"Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1288569600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0899-9007(03)00035-2"],"pmid":"12831940","pubdate":"2003-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Cross-sectional study of blood lead effects on iron status in Korean lead workers","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0899900703000352","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crosssectional-study-blood-lead-effects-iron-status-korean-lead-workers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7328433,"mean":6.3762917456252,"rank":1747878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4612719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7328433,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93023,"mean":12.586970415601,"rank":30552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":60823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93023,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1328,"mean":8.0852871137905,"rank":431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1328,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":6.93,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
