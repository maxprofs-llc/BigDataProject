A total of 27\u00a0patients with IgAN and 10\u00a0healthy controls (HC) were recruited for analysis of the frequencies of different subsets of B and Tfh cells. ELISA was used to analyze the concentration of serum interleukin (IL)\u201121. The transcriptional levels of activation\u2011induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in the B\u00a0cells were determined using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while the translational levels of AID were analyzed using western blotting. The frequencies of circulating memory and activated B\u00a0cells and Tfh cells were found to be significantly increased in the IgAN groups, compared with those of the HC group, although the number of plasma cells were not significantly different between the two IgAN groups. In addition, the serum levels of IL\u201121 were found to be higher in the patients with IgAN, and correlated with 24\u2011h\u00a0proteinuria. IL\u201121 also enhanced the expression levels of AID in the B\u00a0cells. The data of the present study revealed that the high levels of memory and activated B\u00a0cells and Tfh cells were positively associated with the progression of IgAN, and that this may be mediated by the overexpression of AID, which is potentially regulated by IL\u201121.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Sun, Ying","Liu, Zhihong","Liu, Ying","Li, Xia"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2015.4071","first_seen_on":"2016-06-26T01:07:21+00:00","issns":["1791-3004","1791-2997"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1467425148,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26166388?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26166388","pubdate":"2015-07-09T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Increased frequencies of memory and activated B\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdcells\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand follicular helper T\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdcells are positively associated with high levels of activation\u2011induced cytidine deaminase in patients with immunoglobulin\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdA nephropathy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-frequencies-memory-activated-b%C3%AFcells%C3%AFand-follicular-helper-t%C3%AFcells-positively-associated-h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":3956576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3816238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261690,"mean":11.509645877358,"rank":130060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":121016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261690,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1997,"mean":1.6137384769539,"rank":262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1997,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144,"mean":1.1377622377622,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
