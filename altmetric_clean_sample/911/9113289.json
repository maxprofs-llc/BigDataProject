Following ICM outgrowth on inactivated human feeders, karyotype was confirmed as 46, XY and STR analysis demonstrated a male Allele pattern. The hESC line had pluripotent cell morphology, 92% of cells expressed Nanog, 97% Oct4, 79% Tra1-60 and 99% SSEA4, gave a Pluritest Pluripotency score of 25.45, Novelty of 1.45 demonstrated Alkaline Phosphatase activity and tri-lineage teratoma formation. The cell line was negative for Mycoplasma and visible contamination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008a35","authors":["Dumevska, Biljana","Chami, Omar","Main, Heather","McKernan, Robert","Goel, Divya","Schmidt, Uli"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scr.2016.02.023","endpage":"506","first_seen_on":"2016-06-29T08:33:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-7753","18735061"],"issue":"2","journal":"Stem Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1467183795,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27346025"],"pmid":"27346025","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"503","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Derivation of FSHD1 affected human embryonic stem cell line Genea050","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/derivation-fshd1-affected-human-embryonic-stem-cell-line-genea050"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":6038292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1072210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261241,"mean":11.538239082835,"rank":183230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261241,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":436,"mean":3.1681057471264,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":436,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":5.9158333333333,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DoubleHomeobox4\/statuses\/748049173795180544","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9113289],"posted_on":"2016-06-29T07:03:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Miller Lab","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/668890070707863552\/aNBoBUf5_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"DoubleHomeobox4","tweeter_id":"3153629780","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":38},"tweet_id":"748049173795180544"}]}}
