Because cross-sections give a two-dimensional (2D) representation, little is known about the actual underlying three-dimensional (3D) architectural features of benign prostate tissue and prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we show that a combination of tissue clearing protocols and confocal microscopy can successfully be applied to investigate the 3D architecture of human prostate tissue.\nOptical clearing of intact fresh and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical prostate specimens allowed us to visualize tissue structures up to a depth of 800 \u03bcm, whereas in un-cleared tissue detection of fluorescence was only possible up to 70 \u03bcm. Fluorescent labeling with a general nuclear dye and antibodies against cytokeratin (CK) 5 and 8-18 resulted in comprehensive 3D imaging of benign peripheral and transition prostate zones, as well as individual PCa growth patterns. After staining, clearing and imaging, samples could still be processed for 2D (immuno)histochemical staining and DNA analysis enabling additional molecular and diagnostic characterization of small tissue specimens.\nIn conclusion, applicability of 3D imaging on archival FFPE and fresh clinical specimens offers unlimited opportunities to study clinical and biological topics of interest in their actual 3D context.
