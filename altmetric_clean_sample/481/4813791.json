Following the proof of activity in mammalian cells, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have quickly crept into biomedical research as a new powerful tool for the potential treatment of different human diseases based on altered gene expression. In the past decades, several promising data from ongoing clinical trials have been reported. However, despite surprising successes in many pre-clinical studies, concrete obstacles still need to be overcome to translate therapeutic siRNAs into clinical reality. Here, we provide an update on the recent advances of RNAi-based therapeutics and highlight novel synthetic platforms for the intracellular delivery of siRNAs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f6100039c4","authors":["Sarisozen, Can","Salzano, Giuseppina","Torchilin, Vladimir P"],"doi":"10.1515\/bmc-2015-0019","first_seen_on":"2015-11-27T11:08:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1868-503X"],"issue":"5-6","journal":"Biomolecular Concepts","last_mentioned_on":1448622434,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26609865?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26609865","pubdate":"2015-11-27T22:00:13+00:00","title":"Recent advances in siRNA delivery.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-advances-sirna-delivery-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6613942,"mean":6.1334676036573,"rank":5643462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6613942,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251103,"mean":9.2247356612054,"rank":198815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251103,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":1.8370277777778,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.66666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
