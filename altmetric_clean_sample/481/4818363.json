There were 260 specifically accumulated proteins in Yuyan8 after 24h inoculation (Yd), and the accumulations of 285 proteins inherent in Y have changed after TMV infection. Equally, there were 183 specifically accumulated proteins in NC89 after 24h inoculation (Nd), and 132 proteins inherent in N have changed after TMV infection. These differential proteins were respectively enriched in two pathways, of which photosynthesis pathway was the common pathway in two varieties. In photoreaction system, the accumulations of differential proteins, especially D1 protein, were not decreased in Yd compared to Nd. The results indicated that maintaining the stability of D1 protein and reasonable utilization of the energy was the essential for tolerance to TMV infection. It was also revealed that 14-3-3 protein and PR4 was specific expressed, and the expression of LRR was enhanced in Yd, suggesting that regulation of defense protein mediated by 14-3-3 protein quickly activated resistance system and enhanced the plant tolerance to TMV infection.\nThis is the first work that the molecular basis of tobacco tolerance was discussed basic on proteomic investigation performed on wild type and its natural mutant. Our results lay the foundation for development of molecular breeding and further proteome research in tobacco.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ee4","authors":["Wang, Jing","Wang, Xiao-Ran","Zhou, Qi","Yang, Jin-Miao","Guo, Hong-Xiang","Yang, Li-Jun","Liu, Wei-Qun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jprot.2015.11.009","first_seen_on":"2015-11-28T21:29:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-7737","18743919"],"journal":"Journal of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1448746160,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1874391915301858&_version=1&md5=97f0b05e372e7366c31e0670afe4efc9"],"pmid":"26608101","pubdate":"2015-11-28T22:02:03+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"iTRAQ protein profile analysis provides integrated insight into mechanisms of tolerance to TMV in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/itraq-protein-profile-analysis-provides-integrated-insight-mechanisms-tolerance-tmv-tobacco-nicotian"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6615543,"mean":6.1355830745238,"rank":5644839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6615543,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250920,"mean":9.2050844615194,"rank":198632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250920,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1496,"mean":1.9429311036789,"rank":911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1496,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.6943448275862,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
