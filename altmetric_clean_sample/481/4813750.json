Scotta retains most of the lactose of the milk and it is normally colonized by a natural microbiota. A treatment was devised to reduce the autochthonous microbial populations in order to reduce competition towards the inoculated bacterial strains. Nine lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were assessed for their capability to develop in scotta. They evidenced different behaviors regarding growth rate, acidification capability and nitrogen consumption. A co-inoculum of three LAB, namely a Streptococcus thermophilus, a Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and a Lb. acidophilus strains, chosen among those giving the best performances in single-strain fermentation trials, gave abundant (close to 109 cfu\/ml) and balanced growth and lowered pH to 4\u00b72, a value similar to that of yogurt. These results show that scotta may have potential as a substrate for bacterial growth for the production of a fermented drink. Further studies are needed to optimize the organoleptic aspects of the final product.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c31","authors":["Maragkoudakis, Petros","Vendramin, Veronica","Bovo, Barbara","Treu, Laura","Corich, Viviana","Giacomini, Alessio"],"doi":"10.1017\/s002202991500059x","first_seen_on":"2015-11-27T11:06:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-7629"],"journal":"Journal of Dairy Research","last_mentioned_on":1448644759,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26608679?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26608679","pubdate":"2015-11-27T22:00:42+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Potential use of scotta, the by-product of the ricotta cheese manufacturing process, for the production of fermented drinks.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-scotta-byproduct-ricotta-cheese-manufacturing-process-production-fermented-drinks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6613942,"mean":6.1334676036573,"rank":2946222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3489781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6613942,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251103,"mean":9.2247229173802,"rank":119805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":120852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251103,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":1.7761983471074,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
