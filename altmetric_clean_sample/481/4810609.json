Additional imaging, including computed tomography (CT)-scan with careful interpretation is required in order to not misdiagnose cervical posterior arch malformation with subsequent inappropriate management. A 39-year-old patient presented to the emergency unit of our university hospital after being trampled by a cow over her back and head followed by loss of consciousness, retrograde amnesia and neck pain. Her initial cervical CT-scan showed possible C5-C6 dislocation, then, it became clear that her problem was a misdiagnosed congenital cervical abnormality. Patient was treated symptomatically without consequences. The congenital absence of a cervical pedicle is a very unusual condition that is easily misdiagnosed. Diagnosis can be accurately confirmed with a CT-scan of the cervical spine. Symptomatic conservative treatment will result in resolution of the symptoms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f610004372","authors":["Abduljabbar, Fahad H","Rossel, Felipe","Nooh, Anas","Jarzem, Peter"],"doi":"10.4081\/or.2015.5889","first_seen_on":"2015-11-26T11:53:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2035-8237"],"issue":"3","journal":"Orthopedic Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1448538820,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26605026?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26605026","pubdate":"2015-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Misdiagnosing Absent Pedicle of Cervical Spine in the Acute Trauma Setting.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/misdiagnosing-absent-pedicle-cervical-spine-acute-trauma-setting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6611727,"mean":6.131580845607,"rank":5641720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6611727,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250365,"mean":9.2463435238293,"rank":198278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250365,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":4.1346086956522,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.4625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/painmanwise\/statuses\/669846479599738880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4810609],"posted_on":"2015-11-26T11:53:40+00:00","author":{"name":"painmanwise","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514094062056390656\/ORtXawZi_normal.png","id_on_source":"painmanwise","tweeter_id":"2826634074","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":131},"tweet_id":"669846479599738880"}]}}
