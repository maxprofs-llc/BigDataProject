The recommended treatment of severe invasive GAS infections is a combination of clindamycin and penicillin. Until 2012, almost all emm1 isolates were susceptible to clindamycin.\nWe aimed to identify the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of emm1 GAS clone resistant to clindamycin.\nGAS strains were characterized by emm sequence typing, detection of genes encoding pyrogenic exotoxins or superantigens. Cluster analysis was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed using disk diffusion and resistance genes were detected by PCR.\nA total of 1321\u00a0GAS invasive isolates were analyzed between January\u00a02011 and December\u00a02012. The overall number of invasive isolates resistant to clindamycin was 52 (3.9%); seven of them were emm1 isolates. All isolates had the same genomic markers: macrolide resistance due to the presence of the erm(B) gene, emm subtype\u00a01.0, the same toxin or superantigen profile, PFGE pattern and sequence type.\nThis is the first description of highly virulent GAS emm1 isolates resistant to clindamycin in France. This article strengthens the need for monitoring the epidemiology of invasive GAS strains as they could lead to changes in treatment guidelines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000308a","authors":["Plainvert, C","Martin, C","Loubinoux, J","Touak, G","Dmytruk, N","Collobert, G","Fouet, A","Ploy, M-C","Poyart, C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.medmal.2015.10.008","first_seen_on":"2015-11-26T11:14:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1769-6690"],"journal":"Medecine & Maladies Infectieuses","last_mentioned_on":1448536482,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26602794?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26602794","pubdate":"2015-11-26T22:01:26+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine","communicablediseases"],"title":"Highly virulent M1 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates resistant to clindamycin.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highly-virulent-m1-streptococcus-pyogenes-isolates-resistant-clindamycin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6611727,"mean":6.131580845607,"rank":5641712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6611727,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250364,"mean":9.2463764613781,"rank":198271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250364,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181,"mean":2.1924777777778,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
