Of 186 subjects who had a high BIV for weight or body mass index (BMI), all but one subject had both arm and waist circumferences that were greater than the sex- and age-specific 95th percentiles; 75% of subjects had circumferences greater than the 99th percentile. Of 63 subjects with a high height BIV, 75% of them had a leg length that was greater than the 95th percentile. The exclusion of children and adolescents with a BIV reduced the overall prevalence of obesity by \u223c0.5 percentage points and by 1.7% in non-Hispanic blacks.\nMost of the extremely high values of weight, height, and BMI flagged as BIVs in the NHANES are very likely correct. The increase of z score cutoffs or the use of an alternative method to detect possible errors could improve the balance between removing incorrect values and retaining extremely high, but accurate, values in other data sets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["David S Freedman","Hannah G Lawman","Asheley C Skinner","Lisa C McGuire","David B Allison","Cynthia L Ogden","Freedman, David S","Lawman, Hannah G","Skinner, Asheley C","McGuire, Lisa C","Allison, David B","Ogden, Cynthia L","D.
