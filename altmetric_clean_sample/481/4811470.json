Around half of the lay persons (42\u00a0%) and doctors (37\u00a0%) thought that umbilical cord blood can be used to treat any genetic disorder including Duchenne muscular dystrophy and mental retardation. Ninteen percent of the doctors thought that umbilical cord blood can be used to treat thalassemia in the same child.\nThe propaganda done by cord blood banks that cord blood is a biological insurance for the child is misleading and should be discouraged. The obstetricians and the pediatricians should take a central role in providing the correct information to would be parents to help them in taking a correct decision.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007754","authors":["Moni Tuteja","Meenal Agarwal","Shubha R.
