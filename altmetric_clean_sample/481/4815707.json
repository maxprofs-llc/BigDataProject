In order to prevent morbidity and mortality due to opportunistic infections in children, the World Health Organization recommends the use of prophylaxis using co-trimoxazole. However, the challenges affecting effective implementation of this policy in Tanzania have not been documented.\nIn this study, we assessed the challenges facing the provision of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis among children born to HIV-infected mothers in the public hospitals of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\nFour hundred and ninety-eight infants' PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV) register books for the past 2 years were reviewed to obtain information regarding the provision of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis. One hundred and twenty-six health care workers were interviewed to identify success stories and challenges in the provision of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in children. In addition, 321 parents and guardians of children born to HIV-infected mothers were interviewed in the health facilities.\nApproximately 80% of children were initiated with co-trimoxazole prophylaxis within 2 months after birth. Two hundred and ninety-one (58.4%) children started using co-trimoxazole within 4 weeks after birth. Majority (n=458, 91.8%) of the children were prescribed 120 mg of co-trimoxazole per day, whereas 39 (7.8%) received 240 mg per day. Only a small proportion (n=1, 0.2%) of children received 480 mg\/day. Dose determination was based on the child's age rather than body weight. Parents and guardians reported that 42 (13.1%) children had missed one or more doses of co-trimoxazole during the course of prophylaxis. The majority of health care workers (89.7%) reported that co-trimoxazole is very effective for the prevention of opportunistic infections among children, but frequent shortage of co-trimoxazole in the health facilities was the main challenge.\nMost children who were initiated with co-trimoxazole prophylaxis did not experience significant opportunistic infections, and the drug was well tolerated. The major barrier for co-trimoxazole prophylaxis was due to frequent out-of-stocks of pediatric co-trimoxazole formulations in the health facilities. Dose determination was based on the age rather than the weight of children, thus creating potential for under- or over-dosing of children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc00","authors":["Appolinary Kamuhabwa","Vicky Manyanga"],"doi":"10.2147\/dhps.s89115","first_seen_on":"2015-11-27T21:23:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-1365"],"journal":"Drug, Healthcare and Patient Safety","last_mentioned_on":1448659400,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/challenges-facing-effective-implementation-of-co-trimoxazole-prophylax-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DHPS"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=27769","pmid":"26604825","pubdate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Challenges facing effective implementation of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in children born to HIV-infected mothers in the public health facilities","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/challenges-facing-effective-implementation-cotrimoxazole-prophylaxis-children-born-hivinfected-mothe-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6613942,"mean":6.1334676036573,"rank":2946223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3489783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6613942,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251103,"mean":9.22473167876,"rank":119806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":120851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251103,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":3.1080519480519,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":9.9013333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
