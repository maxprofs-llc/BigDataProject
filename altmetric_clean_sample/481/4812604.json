All participants had a full clinical and laboratory evaluation. von Willebrand factor antigen (vWf Ag) plasma levels were measured on two different occasions: 1 day before the beginning of the preseason preparation period and after 7 weeks of strenuous exercise.\nMean vWf Ag plasma levels were significantly decreased from 95.1%\u00b126% to 88.3%\u00b127.2% at the end of the experimental period (P=0.018), suggesting a potential beneficial effect on the endothelium of these athletes. Further analysis showed that age greater than 29 years with an age range from 29 to 34 years can not impair this effect (P>0.05).\nStrenuous exercise did not lead to endothelium activation or dysfunction in well-trained elite soccer players. On the contrary, it seemed to produce a beneficial effect on the endothelium of these players.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c56","authors":["Nikolaos Androulakis","Nikolaos Koundourakis","Eleni Nioti","Paraskevi Spatharaki","Michael Alexandrakis","Despina Hatzisymeon","Ioannis Miminas"],"doi":"10.2147\/vhrm.s92636","first_seen_on":"2015-11-27T01:00:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2048"],"journal":"Vascular Health and Risk Management","last_mentioned_on":1448856402,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/preseason-preparation-training-and-endothelial-function-in-elite-profe-peer-reviewed-article-VHRM","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=24767"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=28163","pmcid":"PMC4664530","pmid":"26648731","pubdate":"2015-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Preseason preparation training and endothelial function in elite professional soccer players","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preseason-preparation-training-endothelial-function-elite-professional-soccer-players"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6625817,"mean":6.1430520464149,"rank":2435944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4159729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6625817,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251470,"mean":9.2286227407748,"rank":92945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":156590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251470,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":363,"mean":2.9452928176796,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":363,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":4.83,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
