Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study to assess the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab as an alternative to glucocorticoids. We included 13 consecutive patients with PMR (11 women and 2 men; median age, 74\u2005years) diagnosed according to Bird's criteria and the 2012 European League Against Rheumatism\/American College of Rheumatology provisional classification criteria. All patients received tocilizumab infusion (8\u2005mg\/kg every 4\u2005weeks) at our institutions, between 2008 and 2014, because of PMR relapses (n=12) or insufficient response to initial prednisolone treatment (n=1), without increasing prednisolone dosage. Seven patients were on methotrexate, and all had one or more glucocorticoid-related comorbidities. Administration of tocilizumab significantly improved inflammation and PMR symptoms such as morning stiffness, as well as the Patient-Pain and Patient-Global Assessment visual analogue scales (p<0.05). Proximal muscle pain disappeared within 8\u2005weeks, on average, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index scores (p=0.098) and concomitant prednisolone doses (p<0.05) decreased at 12\u2005weeks. Severe adverse events were not observed during the mean tocilizumab treatment period of 43.4\u2005weeks. Our findings suggest that tocilizumab is effective and safe for PMR treatment.","altmetric_jid":"561d19e92a83eebf4d8b4567","authors":["Keisuke Izumi","Harumi Kuda","Mari Ushikubo","Masataka Kuwana","Tsutomu Takeuchi","Hisaji Oshima"],"doi":"10.1136\/rmdopen-2015-000162","first_seen_on":"2015-11-28T21:13:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-5933"],"issue":"1","journal":"RMD Open","last_mentioned_on":1449330279,"links":["http:\/\/m.rmdopen.bmj.com\/content\/1\/1\/e000162?cpetoc","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26635968?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26635968\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rmdopen.bmj.com\/content\/1\/1\/e000162.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4663453","pmid":"26635968","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Tocilizumab is effective against polymyalgia rheumatica: experience in 13 intractable cases.","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tocilizumab-effective-against-polymyalgia-rheumatica-experience-13-intractable-cases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7292491,"mean":6.3689551788176,"rank":5248718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1787633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7292491,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284927,"mean":8.7841853323318,"rank":176791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":90136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284927,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":4.105519379845,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":3.0192307692308,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Social Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"EC":1},"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IlindelatorreMD\/statuses\/670712078940905477","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4818344],"posted_on":"2015-11-28T21:13:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Ilin Gilberto dlT","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/836054970407452676\/xjxB0SNL_normal.jpg","description":"M\u00e9dico Internista.
