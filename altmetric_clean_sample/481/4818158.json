However, it remains a major clinical concern for promoting high-efficiency and high-quality osseointegration of pTi, which is beneficial for securing long-term implant stability. Accumulating evidence demonstrates the capacity of low-amplitude whole-body vibration (WBV) in preventing osteopenia, whereas the effects and mechanisms of WBV on osteogenesis and osseointegration of pTi remain unclear. Our present study shows that WBV enhanced cellular attachment and proliferation, and induced well-organized cytoskeleton of primary osteoblasts in pTi. WBV upregulated osteogenesis-associated gene and protein expression in primary osteoblasts, including OCN, Runx2, Wnt3a, Lrp6 and \u03b2-catenin. In vivo findings demonstrate that 6-week and 12-week WBV stimulated osseointegration, bone ingrowth and bone formation rate of pTi in rabbit femoral bone defects via \u03bcCT, histological and histomorphometric analyses. WBV induced higher ALP, OCN, Runx2, BMP2, Wnt3a, Lrp6 and \u03b2-catenin, and lower Sost and RANKL\/OPG gene expression in rabbit femora. Our findings demonstrate that WBV promotes osteogenesis and osseointegration of pTi via its anabolic effect and potential anti-catabolic activity, and imply the promising potential of WBV for enhancing the repair efficiency and quality of pTi in osseous defects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Jing, Da","Tong, Shichao","Zhai, Mingming","Li, Xiaokang","Cai, Jing","Wu, Yan","Shen, Guanghao","Zhang, Xuhui","Xu, Qiaoling","Guo, Zheng","Luo, Erping"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep17134","first_seen_on":"2015-11-28T19:37:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1448744685,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26601709?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26601709","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Bone","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Fracture repair","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biomedical engineering","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Effect of low-level mechanical vibration on osteogenesis and osseointegration of porous titanium implants in the repair of long bone defects.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-lowlevel-mechanical-vibration-osteogenesis-osseointegration-porous-titanium-implants-repair-l"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6615543,"mean":6.1355830745238,"rank":2890928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3668436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6615543,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250921,"mean":9.2050477761836,"rank":116983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":131222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250921,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23334,"mean":14.249553165045,"rank":12177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":10951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23334,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2303,"mean":13.827051259774,"rank":1207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2303,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
