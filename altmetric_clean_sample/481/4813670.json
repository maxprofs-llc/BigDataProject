First, graphene oxide (GO) was reduced to rGO using hydrazine in a basic solution containing tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH), and then deposited over the nanostructured hematite photoanodes previously treated at 750 \u00baC for 30 min. The second method followed the deposition of a paste containing a mixture of hematite nanoparticles and rGO sheets by doctor-blade method varying the rGO concentration. Since hematite suffers from low electron mobility and slow reaction kinetics, the incorporation of rGO in the hematite can overcome such limitations due to graphene exceptional properties. Using the first method, the rGO incorporation resulted in a photocurrent density increase from 0.56 to 0.82 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE. Our results indicate that the rGO incorporation in the hematite photoanodes showed a positive effect in the reduction of the electron-hole recombination rate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Carminati, Saulo A","De Souza, Flavio Leandro","Nogueira, Ana F","do\u2005Amaral\u2005Carminati, Saulo","Souza, Flavio L.","Nogueira, Ana F."],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201500659","endpage":"177","first_seen_on":"2015-11-27T10:35:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1439-7641"],"issue":"1","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1448620513,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cphc.201500659"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201500659\/pdf","pmid":"26561385","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
