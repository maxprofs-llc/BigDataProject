It has been demonstrated that rasagiline can improve motor and some non-motor symptoms (NMS) in both early and advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and it also exhibits neuroprotective and antiapoptotic properties.\nThe objective of this review, performed by a Medline search on the most recent papers investigating the therapeutic effects of rasagiline, is to describe the role of rasagiline in the schedule of treatment of early and advanced PD patients. It will then focus on its role in treating NMS, fatigue, early morning off and cognitive decline, which heavily affect quality of life for PD patients.\nRasagiline is an efficacious, well-tolerated, easy to use drug. The drug has been extensively studied and has proven its efficacy in monotherapy and in combination with any other antiparkinsonian therapy. It proved to be efficacious in reducing 'off' time and in improving early morning 'off' but also some NMS, thus enhancing the therapeutic approach to PD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c7","authors":["Stocchi, Fabrizio","Fossati, Chiara","Torti, Margherita"],"doi":"10.1517\/14656566.2015.1086748","first_seen_on":"2015-11-26T18:38:27+00:00","issns":["1744-7666"],"issue":"14","journal":"Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1443201230,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26364897"],"pmid":"26364897","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Rasagiline for the treatment of Parkinson's disease: an update.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rasagiline-treatment-parkinsons-disease-update-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6401717,"mean":5.8574764007039,"rank":829696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":5521687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6401717,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240421,"mean":9.1595532152067,"rank":43215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":194619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240421,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1070,"mean":1.9213788587465,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1070,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.1779069767442,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
