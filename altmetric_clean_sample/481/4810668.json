Heparins, polydisperse mixtures of non-anticoagulant and anticoagulant oligosaccharides, are widely used as anticoagulants. However, heparins are also reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. Unfractionated heparin was initially used in patients with UC for the treatment of rectal microthrombi. Surprisingly, it was found to be effective in reducing UC-associated symptoms. Since then, several pre-clinical and clinical studies have reported promising outcomes of heparins in UC. In contrast, some controlled clinical trials demonstrated no or only limited benefits, thus the potential of heparins for the treatment of UC remains uncertain. This review discusses potential mechanisms of action of heparins, as well as proposed reasons for their contradictory clinical effectiveness in the treatment of UC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073ce","authors":["Qi Ying Lean","Lean, Qi Ying","Gueven, Nuri","Eri, Rajaraman D","Bhatia, Rajesh","Sohal, Sukhwinder Singh","Stewart, Niall","Peterson, Gregory M","Patel, Rahul P"],"doi":"10.1586\/17512433.2015.1082425","endpage":"811","first_seen_on":"2015-11-26T12:03:01+00:00","issns":["1751-2441","1751-2433"],"issue":"6","journal":"Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1448539359,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/17512433.2015.1082425"],"pmid":"26308504","pubdate":"2015-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"795","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Heparins in ulcerative colitis: proposed mechanisms of action and potential reasons for inconsistent clinical outcomes","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heparins-ulcerative-colitis-proposed-mechanisms-action-potential-reasons-inconsistent-clinical-outco"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6611727,"mean":6.131580845607,"rank":4891480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":970124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6611727,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250365,"mean":9.2463465194676,"rank":170295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":52085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250365,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":7.0476580645161,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.9125,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/priti_nagda\/statuses\/669848741835247616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4810668],"posted_on":"2015-11-26T12:02:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Priti Nagda","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/journal\/err","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/761565264047640577\/f24yR41M_normal.jpg","description":"Senior Commissioning Editor for Expert Review of QoL in Cancer Care and Expert Review of Clinical Pharmacology.
