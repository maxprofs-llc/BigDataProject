We studied another polyketide antibiotic, structurally related manumycin A known as a streptomycete derived farnesyltransferase inhibitor with limited antibacterial effects, with respect to its potential regulation of mRNA expression of several genes associated with proinflammatory responses. Downregulation of mRNA for IL-6, TLR-8, IL-1 beta and IL-10 was found in THP-1 cells after 4h stimulation with TNF alpha in the presence of manumycin A and downregulated TLR-8 and EGR-1 genes were observed after 8h. Among the genes upregulated in response to manumycin were HMOX-1, TNFRSF10A, IL-1R1, TICAM2, NLRP12 after 4h and only IL-1R1 after 8h. Furthermore, manumycin A was found to inhibit IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 production in TNF alpha stimulated THP-1 cells and peripheral blood monocytes in a dose dependent manner (0.25-1\u03bcM of manumycin A) without affecting cell viability. Cell viability of blood monocytes decreased by about 30% at manumycin A doses of 2-5\u03bcM. Manumycin A also inhibited IL-18 release from THP-1 cells, while in cultures of blood monocytes, this cytokine was not detectable. That manumycin A mediated downregulation of proinflammatory genes in human monocytes confirmed by a measurement of cytokine levels in culture supernatants, together with a very limited effect on cell viability, might suggest potential anti-inflammatory properties of this polyketide antibiotic.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a9b","authors":["Cecrdlova, Eva","Petrickova, Katerina","Kolesar, Libor","Petricek, Miroslav","Sekerkova, Alena","Svachova, Veronika","Striz, Ilja"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.imlet.2015.11.010","first_seen_on":"2015-11-26T11:14:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0542"],"journal":"Immunology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1448544158,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26602157?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26602157","pubdate":"2015-11-26T22:01:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Manumycin A downregulates release of proinflammatory cytokines from TNF alpha stimulated human monocytes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/manumycin-downregulates-release-proinflammatory-cytokines-tnf-alpha-stimulated-human-monocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7063575,"mean":6.2806243807996,"rank":3307550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3571839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7063575,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282504,"mean":8.7575864964265,"rank":130621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":140198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282504,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":526,"mean":1.8984533333333,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":526,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":0.825,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
