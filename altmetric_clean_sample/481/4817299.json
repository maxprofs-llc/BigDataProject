As pupils of latanoprost-treated eyes may have to be dilated for ophthalmoscopy or intraocular surgery, we studied whether 0.5% tropicamide or 1% atropine alter the effects of 0.005% latanoprost on pupil diameter (PD) and IOP in healthy dogs.\nIOP and PD were measured hourly, 8 AM-4 PM, with the right and left eyes serving as control (CE) and treated (TE) eyes, respectively. Measurements were conducted in ten Labrador retrievers with one-week washout: (i) baseline values, (ii) latanoprost at 8 AM, (iii) tropicamide at 8 AM, (iv) latanoprost at 8 AM and tropicamide at 11 AM, and (v) latanoprost at 8 AM and atropine at 11 AM (n = 4).\nAt 4 PM, TE PD was 5.88 \u00b1 0.59, 3.62 \u00b1 0.66, 6.33 \u00b1 1.00, 5.42 \u00b1 0.57, and 8.12 \u00b1 1.24 mm in sessions 1-5, respectively. TE PD was significantly different between treatment sessions 2, 4, and 5 (P = 0.018, Friedman), being most mydriatic in session 5. At 4 PM, TE IOP was 11.27 \u00b1 2.07, 7.10 \u00b1 1.07, 11.1 \u00b1 2.21, 7.70 \u00b1 1.85, and 8.87 \u00b1 1.42 mm Hg in sessions 1-5, respectively, with no differences between treatment sessions 2, 4, and 5 (P = 0.105, Friedman).\nTropicamide and atropine counteracted latanoprost's miotic effect, with atropine causing significantly larger mydriasis, sufficient for indirect ophthalmoscopy. Neither drug counteracted the hypotensive effect of latanoprost during this study period. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the potential risks in glaucomatous dogs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fc","authors":["Kahane, Nili","Raskansky, Hilli","Bdolah\u2010Abram, Tali","Ofri, Ron"],"doi":"10.1111\/vop.12330","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2015-11-28T11:33:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1463-5224"],"issue":"6","journal":"Veterinary Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1448710418,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vop.12330\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vop.12330\/pdf","pmid":"26607964","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"The effects of topical parasympatholytic drugs on pupil diameter and intraocular pressure in healthy dogs treated with 0.005% latanoprost","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-topical-parasympatholytic-drugs-pupil-diameter-intraocular-pressure-healthy-dogs-treated-000"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6615543,"mean":6.1355830745238,"rank":5644832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6615543,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250920,"mean":9.2051017977913,"rank":198628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250920,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":1.4336439169139,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.275,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/670566214314418176","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4817299],"posted_on":"2015-11-28T11:33:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2106},"tweet_id":"670566214314418176"}]}}
