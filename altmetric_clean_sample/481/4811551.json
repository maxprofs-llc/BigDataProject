The fit of the observed age-specific rates and the rates based on the two-component model was good. In 1953-62, the accumulated net risk ratio (RR; early-age versus late-age) was 0.42 (95% CI 0.29-0.61). The early-age component disappeared in 1973-77 (RR 0.00; 95% CI 0.00-0.08). Thereafter, the risk for the early-age component increased, whereas the risk for the late-age component decreased, and in 2008-2012 the RR was 0.55 (95% CI 0.24-0.89).\nIn Finland, cervical cancer incidence has two age-related components which are likely to indicate differences in risk factors of each component. The trend in risk of both components followed the effects of organised screening. Furthermore, the risk related to the early-age component followed changes in risk factors, such as oncogenic HPV infections and other sexually transmitted diseases and smoking habits.\nCervical cancer incidence has two age-related components which are likely to have differencies in their aetiology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000244e","authors":["Sepp\u00e4, K","Pitk\u00e4niemi, J","Malila, N","Hakama, M"],"doi":"10.1111\/1471-0528.13754","endpage":"778","first_seen_on":"2015-11-26T18:16:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-0528"],"issue":"5","journal":"British Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","last_mentioned_on":1462863354,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1471-0528.13754\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26599730"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1471-0528.13754\/pdf","pmid":"26599730","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"772","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Age\u2010related incidence of cervical cancer supports two aetiological components: a population\u2010based register study","type":"article","volume":"123","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agerelated-incidence-cervical-cancer-supports-two-aetiological-components-populationbased-register-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7679268,"mean":6.5932591477757,"rank":3209260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4359144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7679268,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290227,"mean":8.8443656460826,"rank":105934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":178741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290227,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3070,"mean":7.71344933203,"rank":2241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":794,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3070,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":9.1765979381443,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
