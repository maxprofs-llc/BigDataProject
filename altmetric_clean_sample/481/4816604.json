This study aimed to determine the levels of knowledge of lead hazards among pregnant women in an area where children had already been established to be at a high risk of lead exposure and poisoning.\nFollowing informed consent, a structured questionnaire was administered to 119 pregnant women attending antenatal clinic services at Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital, west of central Johannesburg. Questions were asked about social, demographic and residential characteristics, as well as knowledge, perceptions, behaviours and practices in relation to child lead hazards.\nOverall awareness of the dangers of lead in pregnancy was low (11%). Amongst those who had heard of it, only 15% thought that lead could cause detrimental health effects. A consequence of this low level of awareness of lead hazards is a high potential for the participants and their children to unwittingly be exposed to environmental lead from various sources, thereby undermining preventative approaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Tanya Haman"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph121214968","first_seen_on":"2015-11-28T07:25:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"12","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1448862419,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/12\/12\/14968"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/12\/12\/14968\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4690904","pmid":"26633431","pubdate":"2015-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Low Levels of Awareness of Lead Hazards among Pregnant Women in a High Risk\u2014Johannesburg Neighbourhood","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-levels-awareness-lead-hazards-among-pregnant-women-high-riskjohannesburg-neighbourhood"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7942600,"mean":6.7122274104421,"rank":6021618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1068276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7942600,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293379,"mean":8.8357649994203,"rank":200801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":51182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293379,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2981,"mean":7.4213100671141,"rank":2182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2981,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211,"mean":7.5081333333333,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
