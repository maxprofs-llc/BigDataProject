However, information on the effects of frontal lobe function and behavior changes on the HRQoL of the Chinese PD population is limited. Studies on the associations among frontal lobe function, behavioral changes and the HRQoL may help optimize the treatment and improve the HRQoL of PD patients.\nA total of 309 PD patients were evaluated using the Frontal Assessment Battery, the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) and the PD Questionnaire 39-item version (PDQ-39).\nPatients with worse frontal lobe function were older (p < 0.001), had longer disease durations (p = 0.002), higher Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) scores (p < 0.001) and higher Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stages (p = 0.001), and exhibited significantly higher PDQ-39 summary index (SI; p = 0.001) compared with those who had better frontal lobe function. In addition, the disease duration (p = 0.008), UPDRS-III scores (p < 0.001), H-Y stage (p < 0.001), PDQ-39 SI and scores for each domain of the PDQ-39 (p < 0.001) were higher as the severity of frontal behavioral changes increased. The total FBI score (p < 0.001) was positively correlated with the PDQ-39 SI.\nFrontal behavioral changes were closely associated with poor HRQoL in Chinese PD patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002861","authors":["Guo, Xiaoyan","Song, Wei","Chen, Ke","Chen, Xueping","Zheng, Zhenzhen","Cao, Bei","Huang, Rui","Zhao, Bi","Wu, Ying","Shang, Hui-Fang"],"doi":"10.1159\/000439084","first_seen_on":"2015-11-27T14:05:08+00:00","issns":["1421-9913"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"European Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1443828313,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26417992"],"pmid":"26417992","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Impact of Frontal Lobe Function and Behavioral Changes on Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study from Southwest China.","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-frontal-lobe-function-behavioral-changes-healthrelated-quality-life-patients-parkinsons-disea-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6417407,"mean":5.8841749847222,"rank":833110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":5532021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6417407,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241963,"mean":9.1531508005391,"rank":43545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":195784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241963,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":324,"mean":3.5950526315789,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":324,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.0893333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
