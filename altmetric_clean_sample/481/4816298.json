While elevated number of CD4(+) IL-17A(+) (Th17) and IL-17A(+)TCR\u03b3\u03b4(+) T cells are found within murine atherosclerotic aortas and human plaques, the mechanisms governing IL-17A(+) T cell migration to atherosclerotic lesions are unclear. The chemokine receptor CXCR6 is expressed on several T cell subsets and plays a pro-atherogenic role in atherosclerosis. Here, we used CXCR6-deficient (Cxcr6(GFP\/GFP)) Apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe(-\/-)) mice to investigate the involvement of CXCR6 in the recruitment IL-17A(+) T cells to atherosclerotic aortas. Flow cytometric analyses revealed reductions in Th17 and IL-17A(+)TCR\u03b3\u03b4(+) T cells within aged Cxcr6(GFP\/GFP)Apoe(-\/-) aortas, in comparison with age matched Cxcr6(GFP\/+)Apoe(-\/-) aortas. While CXCR6-sufficient IL-17A(+) T cells efficiently migrated towards CXCL16, the migration of CXCR6-deficient IL-17A(+) T cells was abolished in transwell assays. Importantly, the recruitment of Cxcr6(GFP\/GFP)Apoe(-\/-) IL-17A(+) T cells into the aortas of Apoe(-\/-) recipients was markedly reduced in short-term adoptive transfer experiments. Altogether these results demonstrate an important role of CXCR6 in the regulation of pathological Th17 and IL-17A(+)TCR\u03b3\u03b4(+) T cell recruitment into atherosclerotic lesions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b0d","authors":["Matthew J.
