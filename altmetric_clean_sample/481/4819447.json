Chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules are critical players for homing and retention within these microenvironments. Engagement of B cell antigen receptors and CD40 on HCL cells promote survival and proliferation. In this chapter, we summarize the current knowledge about the cellular and molecular interactions between HCL cells and their supportive tissue microenvironment, and provide insight into new therapeutic approaches targeting B cell receptor signaling in HCL.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006bd5","authors":["Sivina, Mariela","Burger, Jan A","Mariela Sivina","Jan A.
