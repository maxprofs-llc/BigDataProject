In this study, we investigated the size-dependent interactions of LDH NPs with mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).\nLDH NPs with diameters of 100 and 50 nm were synthesized and characterized. mESCs were cultured to undergo spontaneous differentiation. After incubation with LDH NPs, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, pluripotency, differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition process of mESCs were assessed.\nLDH NPs with the size of 50 nm induced higher cellular uptake and more outstandingly inhibited spontaneous differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition process.\nOur research demonstrated the size-dependent effects of LDH NPs on controlling fate and cellular functions of mESCs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823a","authors":["Wu, Youjun","Zhu, Rongrong","Ge, Xin","Sun, Xiaoyu","Wang, Zhaoqi","Wang, Wenrui","Wang, Mei","Liu, Hui","Wang, Shilong","Youjun Wu"],"doi":"10.2217\/nnm.15.158","endpage":"3482","first_seen_on":"2015-11-27T11:06:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1748-6963","1743-5889"],"issue":"23","journal":"Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1449946237,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26607261?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/10.2217\/nnm.15.158"],"pmid":"26607261","pubdate":"2015-11-27T22:01:25+00:00","startpage":"3469","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Size-dependent effects of layered double hydroxide nanoparticles on cellular functions of mouse embryonic stem cells","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sizedependent-effects-layered-double-hydroxide-nanoparticles-cellular-functions-mouse-embryonic-stem-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7097058,"mean":6.2978047134156,"rank":836284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6257063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7097058,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283577,"mean":8.7448065703726,"rank":44017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":239361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283577,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":2.8895550351288,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.2666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
