The most frequently used laboratory parameters is leukocyte (white blood cell) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Availability of plasma calprotectin with CRP to detect anastomotic leakage was studied.\nIn this prospective study of 41 (male\/female 18\/23) patients in the anastomosis group, 30 (male\/female 20\/10) patients were included in the control group. The anastomosis groups viewed in preoperatively day and postoperatively 1st, 3rd, and 5th day of CRP, white blood cell, and plasma calprotectin values.\nAnastomosis group with complications and without complications were studied. Statistically significant similarities between plasma calprotectin and CRP levels in the postoperative period were observed.\nPlasma calprotectin in monitoring the integrity of the anastomosis can be used with a marker CRP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","authors":["Cikot, Murat","Kones, Osman","Gedikbas\u0131, Asuman","Kocatas, Ali","Karabulut, Mehmet","Temizgonul, Kaplan Baha","Alis, Halil","Murat Cikot","Osman Kones","Asuman Gedikbas\u0131","Ali Kocatas","Mehmet Karabulut","Kaplan Baha Temizgonul","Halil Alis"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjsurg.2015.06.018","endpage":"61","first_seen_on":"2015-11-27T11:12:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1883"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1468319993,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26606896?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.americanjournalofsurgery.com\/article\/S0002-9610(15)00431-6\/fulltext&rc=0&code=ajs-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.americanjournalofsurgery.com\/article\/S0002961015004316\/pdf","pmid":"26606896","pubdate":"2015-11-27T22:01:36+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"53","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"The marker C-reactive protein is helpful in\u00a0monitoring the integrity of anastomosis: plasma calprotectin.","type":"article","volume":"212","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/marker-creactive-protein-helpful-inmonitoring-integrity-anastomosis-plasma-calprotectin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069135,"mean":6.8476973499224,"rank":5843929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1939255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069135,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295346,"mean":8.9495555773755,"rank":183706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":93231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295346,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2079,"mean":3.3042107795958,"rank":1314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2079,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":1.9702391304348,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/670198445357985792","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4813820],"posted_on":"2015-11-27T11:12:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"670198445357985792"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AmJSurgery\/statuses\/752814730931122177","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4813820],"posted_on":"2016-07-12T10:39:53+00:00","author":{"name":"AmJSurgery","url":"http:\/\/www.americanjournalofsurgery.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/583720504277782529\/CosJCurw_normal.jpg","description":"American Journal of Surgery","id_on_source":"AmJSurgery","tweeter_id":"3131344053","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2481},"tweet_id":"752814730931122177"}]}}
