However, the associations of TRIs in renal transplant biopsy specimens are not known. We analyzed data from 316 patients who had a transplant biopsy with electron microscopy examination; 41 of 316 (13.0%) patients had TRIs. Patients with TRIs had significantly lower allograft survival rates (50.9%) than patients without TRIs (74.3%; P=0.03). Transplant glomerulopathy-free survival was also inferior in the TRI-positive group (57.5%) compared with the TRI-negative group (87.3%; P=0.002). Serologically, hepatitis C associated with the presence of TRIs (P=0.04) along with donor-specific antibodies (P=0.01). Furthermore, patients who were TRI positive were more likely than patients who were TRI negative to have had a previous rejection episode (P=0.02). On multivariate analysis, TRIs associated with prior rejection, viral infections, and class 1 HLA donor-specific antibodies. These results show that the presence of TRIs in renal allograft biopsy specimens associates with poor allograft outcomes and serologic evidence of viral infections and alloimmunity. The association with alloimmunity is a novel finding that warrants additional investigation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e9c","authors":["Michelle Willicombe","Jill Moss","Linda Moran","Paul Brookes","Eva Santos-Nunez","Adam G.
