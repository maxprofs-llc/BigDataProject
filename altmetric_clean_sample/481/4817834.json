It is also a necessary perception, without which we would do irreparable damage to ourselves. In this article, the authors assess the impact of pain on function of the hand. Pain can be categorized into acute pain, chronic pain, and neuropathic pain. Hand function and objective measurements of hand function are analyzed as well as the impact of different types of pain on each of these areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005908","authors":["Howland, Nicholas","Lopez, Mariela","Zhang, Andrew Y"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.hcl.2015.08.002","first_seen_on":"2015-11-28T15:55:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1558-1969"],"issue":"1","journal":"Hand clinics","last_mentioned_on":1448726103,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26611383?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26611383","pubdate":"2015-11-28T22:00:55+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Pain and Hand Function.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pain-hand-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6615543,"mean":6.1355830745238,"rank":3150504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1975426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6615543,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250920,"mean":9.2050966168365,"rank":131606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":92592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250920,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":11.853466666667,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.8125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":6,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TC_papers\/statuses\/670632002085765120","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4817834],"posted_on":"2015-11-28T15:55:03+00:00","author":{"name":"TC_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507539334375829504\/IcPjrJI3_normal.jpeg","description":"Pubmed twitterbot: arealization OR patterning OR somatosensory OR thalamus OR thalamocortical OR cortical development","id_on_source":"TC_papers","tweeter_id":"2789910212","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":178},"tweet_id":"670632002085765120"}]}}
