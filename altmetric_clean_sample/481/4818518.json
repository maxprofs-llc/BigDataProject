Biochem Soc Trans. 2015 Dec\u2026"],"citation":{"abstract":"In multicellular organisms, the epithelia is a contact surface with the surrounding environment and is exposed to a variety of adverse biotic (pathogenic) and abiotic (chemical) factors. Multi-layered pathways that operate on different time scales have evolved to preserve cellular integrity and elicit stress-specific response. Several stress-response programs are activated until a complete elimination of the stress is achieved. The innate immune response, which is triggered by pathogenic invasion, is rather harmful when active over a prolonged time, thus the response follows characteristic oscillatory trajectories. Here, we review different translation programs that function to precisely fine-tune the time at which various components of the innate immune response dwell between active and inactive. We discuss how different pro-inflammatory pathways are co-ordinated to temporally offset single reactions and to achieve an optimal balance between fighting pathogens and being less harmful for healthy cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c4","authors":["Robert Rauscher","Zoya Ignatova","Rauscher, Robert","Ignatova, Zoya"],"doi":"10.1042\/bst20150166","endpage":"1252","first_seen_on":"2015-11-28T23:14:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1470-8752","0300-5127"],"issue":"6","journal":"Biochemical Society Transactions","last_mentioned_on":1473870789,"links":["http:\/\/www.biochemsoctrans.org\/content\/43\/6\/1247.large.jpg?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26614668?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26614668?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biochemsoctrans.org\/content\/ppbiost\/43\/6\/1247.full.pdf","pmid":"26614668","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Portland Press Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1247","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Tuning innate immunity by translation.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tuning-innate-immunity-translation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":6060356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2020233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299619,"mean":8.9345760334824,"rank":184750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":96534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299619,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1171,"mean":3.1265675213675,"rank":822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1171,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.0029411764706,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
