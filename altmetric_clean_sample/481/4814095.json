We hypothesized that HLMC and human ASM cell (HASMC) responsiveness to \u03b22-AR agonists would be attenuated when HLMCs are in contact with HASMCs. Cells were cultured in the presence of the short-acting \u03b22-agonist albuterol, and the long-acting \u03b22-agonists formoterol and olodaterol. Constitutive and Fc\u03b5RI-dependent HLMC histamine release, HASMC contraction, and \u03b22-AR phosphorylation at Tyr(350) were assessed. Constitutive HLMC histamine release was increased in HLMC-HASMC coculture and this was enhanced by \u03b22-AR agonists. Inhibition of Fc\u03b5RI-dependent HLMC mediator release by \u03b22-agonists was greatly reduced in HLMC-HASMC coculture. These effects were reversed by neutralization of stem cell factor (SCF) or cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1). \u03b22-AR agonists did not prevent HASMC contraction when HLMCs were present, but this was reversed by fluticasone. \u03b22-AR phosphorylation at Tyr(350) occurred within 5 min in both HLMCs and HASMCs when the cells were cocultured, and was inhibited by neutralizing SCF or CADM1. HLMC interactions with HASMCs via CADM1 and Kit inhibit the potentially beneficial effects of \u03b22-AR agonists on these cells via phosphorylation of the \u03b22-AR. These results may explain the potentially adverse effects of \u03b22-ARs agonists when used for asthma therapy. Targeting SCF and CADM1 may enhance \u03b22-AR efficacy, particularly in corticosteroid-resistant patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Lewis, Rebecca J","Chachi, Latifa","Newby, Chris","Amrani, Yassine","Bradding, Peter"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1402232","first_seen_on":"2015-11-27T12:19:50+00:00","funders":["niehs","wellcome","dohuk"],"issns":["1550-6606"],"journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1464178092,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26608913?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26608913","pubdate":"2015-11-27T22:00:37+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Bidirectional Counterregulation of Human Lung Mast Cell and Airway Smooth Muscle \u03b22 Adrenoceptors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bidirectional-counterregulation-human-lung-mast-cell-airway-smooth-muscle-beta2-adrenoceptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7757128,"mean":6.6329627680391,"rank":3805772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3753538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7757128,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291923,"mean":8.8291619884762,"rank":136723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":143621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291923,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7176,"mean":2.6649878745645,"rank":3467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7176,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208,"mean":2.3703188405797,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"KR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MuscleStemCell\/statuses\/670215379445149696","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4814095],"posted_on":"2015-11-27T12:19:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Satellite Cell Bot","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507221205141577729\/FQlptquo_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweeting articles on muscle stem cells from pubmed RSS feeds.","id_on_source":"MuscleStemCell","tweeter_id":"2788297100","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":225},"tweet_id":"670215379445149696"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/statuses\/735442338693009408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4814095],"posted_on":"2016-05-25T12:08:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
