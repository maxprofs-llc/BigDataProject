In this work, the global search on a series of \"intermediate\" Aum(SR)n clusters with m and n ranging from 5 to 12 was implemented by combining basin hopping algorithm, genetic algorithm and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Most of Aum(SR)n clusters possess the core-shell structure. Specifically, the most popular topologies of inner cores are the tetrahedral Au4 type, triangular bipyramid Au5 type, octahedral Au6 type and vertex-shared Au7 type. Along with the increase of the number of gold atoms and thiolates, the preliminary nucleation and growth processes on both inner core and staple motif protecting unit are grouped into three kinds of size evolution routes, i.e., core-growth, core-dissolution and staple-motif-growth, respectively. Some metastable isomers may also play an important role in the evolution of clusters. The core structures in the lowest-lying isomers and some metastable isomers are similar to the intact or part of the cores found in experimentally detected species. Both the lowest-lying and metastable intermediate clusters may serve as the building block for the next growth. These results rationalize the preliminary nucleation stage, shedding lights on the size-evolution mechanism of RS-AuNPs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Chunyan Liu"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.5b09466","first_seen_on":"2015-11-29T15:23:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1448810619,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.5b09466"],"pmid":"26605978","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"The nucleation and growth mechanism of thiolate-protected Au nanoclusters","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nucleation-growth-mechanism-thiolateprotected-au-nanoclusters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6619724,"mean":6.1397779725815,"rank":4897678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":971620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6619724,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251685,"mean":9.2059495796314,"rank":171274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":52406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251685,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16671,"mean":4.9338651469706,"rank":13525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":2027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16671,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247,"mean":9.1212845528455,"rank":202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
