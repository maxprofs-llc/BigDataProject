The heterogeneity observed is due to the presence of two forms of troponin T, differing in their Mr values, amino acid content, degree of phosphorylation and aggregation. Cardiac troponin T contains up to 0.8 mol of phosphate\/mol of protein. Rabbit skeletal-muscle troponin T kinase phosphorylates the single site located in the N-terminal pentapeptide of cardiac troponin T. The composition of this peptide, (Ser,Asx,Glx,Glx)Val, is similar to that of skeletal-muscle troponin T. The single thiol group of cardiac troponin T is located some 50-70 residues from the N-terminus. The C-terminal sequence of cardiac troponin T is Trp-Lys, i.e. as is the case of skeletal-muscle troponin T.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["Gusev, N B","Barskaya, N V","Verin, A D","Duzhenkova, I V","Khuchua, Z A","Zheltova, A O"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-28T09:23:36+00:00","issns":["0264-6021"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochemical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1448702607,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6615417","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1152098"],"pmcid":"PMC1152098","pmid":"6615417","pubdate":"1983-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Some properties of cardiac troponin T structure.","type":"article","volume":"213","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/some-properties-cardiac-troponin-t-structure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6615543,"mean":6.1355830745238,"rank":1536364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4440127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6615543,"percentile":67},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250920,"mean":9.2050912366142,"rank":74935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":172617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250920,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4232,"mean":2.6893164736469,"rank":398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":1725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4232,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":4.2326923076923,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
