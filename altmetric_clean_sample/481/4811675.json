Only two intramedullary and four extramedullary tumors demonstrated growth in the mean radiological follow-up period of over 6 years. It was found that symptomatic both intra- and extramedullary tumors were associated with younger age at the onset of NF2-related symptoms. 2 patients with intramedullary tumors and 12 patients with extramedullary tumors underwent their tumors resection. In case of symptomatic tumors partial recovery was observed in two patients.\nIt seems that close surveillance with MR imaging is a reasonable option for asymptomatic spinal tumors. Nevertheless, intramedullary tumor removal in non-growing and asymptomatic cases may be an option when ABI implantation is considered. Symptomatic tumors and those of documented growth should be eligible for surgical intervention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cf55","authors":["Nowak, Arkadiusz","Dziedzic, Tomasz","Czernicki, Tomasz","Kunert, Przemys\u0142aw","Marchel, Andrzej"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pjnns.2015.11.004","first_seen_on":"2015-11-26T18:29:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00283843","0028-3843"],"issue":"1","journal":"Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska","last_mentioned_on":1454845066,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0028384315001966&_version=1&md5=b4f1cf039c808cb3278e5e985bcb8b94","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26851687"],"pmid":"26851687","pubdate":"2016-02-07T11:38:13+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurosurgery","neurology"],"title":"Management of spinal tumors in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients ","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-spinal-tumors-neurofibromatosis-type-2-patients-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7128274,"mean":6.3030470395816,"rank":5098621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1776421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7128274,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283063,"mean":8.7667067780203,"rank":175032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":90066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283063,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213,"mean":1.4403301886792,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.8684210526316,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
