Many of them display a high level of aggression and a negative attitude toward sexuality and especially female sexuality. Along with this, erotic fiction with a sadomasochistic orientation has achieved great success and has hundreds of millions of readers in the world. This collective fantasy allows some integration of aggression in sexual life while questioning liberal morality and its equality in gender roles and conservative morality and its idea of control over passion. Both phenomena may represent different responses to the appearance of a new female sexuality threatening the social structure we know.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002217","authors":["Angel Gonzalez-Torres, Miguel","Fern\u00e1ndez-Rivas, Aranzazu"],"doi":"10.1057\/ajp.2015.47","first_seen_on":"2015-11-28T11:30:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-6741"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Journal of Psychoanalysis","last_mentioned_on":1473502566,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26611132?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26611132","pubdate":"2015-11-28T22:00:59+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"FEMALE SEXUALITY, NATIONALISM AND LARGE GROUP IDENTITY.","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/female-sexuality-nationalism-large-group-identity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":6340200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1132511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299385,"mean":8.9325794164015,"rank":203008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":54102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299385,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":2.7696333333333,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.1166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yoursexuality\/statuses\/670565325197279232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4817280],"posted_on":"2015-11-28T11:30:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Mary","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/intimaterelationships411","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/453293693743550465\/W3PJ-AVu_normal.jpeg","description":"Promoting healthy sexuality.","id_on_source":"yoursexuality","tweeter_id":"703938446","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1204},"tweet_id":"670565325197279232"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yoursexuality\/statuses\/774552018312581120","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4817280],"posted_on":"2016-09-10T10:16:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Mary","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/intimaterelationships411","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/453293693743550465\/W3PJ-AVu_normal.jpeg","description":"Promoting healthy sexuality.","id_on_source":"yoursexuality","tweeter_id":"703938446","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1204},"tweet_id":"774552018312581120"}]}}
