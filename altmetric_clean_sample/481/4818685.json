Fifty-six healthy adolescents (25 males, age = 15-19 y) who studied in top high schools and were not habitual short sleepers were randomly assigned to Sleep Restriction (SR) or Control groups. Participants underwent a 2-w protocol consisting of 3 baseline nights (TIB = 9 h), 7 nights of sleep opportunity manipulation (TIB = 5 h for the SR and 9 h for the control groups), and 3 nights of recovery sleep (TIB = 9 h) at a boarding school. A cognitive test battery was administered three times each day.\nDuring the manipulation period, the SR group demonstrated incremental deterioration in sustained attention, working memory and executive function, increase in subjective sleepiness, and decrease in positive mood. Subjective sleepiness and sustained attention did not return to baseline levels even after 2 recovery nights. In contrast, the control group maintained baseline levels of cognitive performance, subjective sleepiness, and mood throughout the study. Incremental improvement in speed of processing, as a result of repeated testing and learning, was observed in the control group but was attenuated in the sleep-restricted participants, who, despite two recovery sleep episodes, continued to perform worse than the control participants.\nA week of partial sleep deprivation impairs a wide range of cognitive functions, subjective alertness, and mood even in high-performing high school adolescents. Some measures do not recover fully even after 2 nights of recovery sleep.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000894a","authors":["Lo, June C","Ong, Ju Lynn","Leong, Ruth L F","Gooley, Joshua J","Chee, Michael W L"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-29T01:13:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1550-9109"],"journal":"Sleep","last_mentioned_on":1474891200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26612392"],"pmid":"26612392","pubdate":"2015-11-29T22:01:07+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology"],"title":"Cognitive Performance, Sleepiness, and Mood in Partially Sleep Deprived Adolescents: The Need for Sleep Study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cognitive-performance-sleepiness-mood-partially-sleep-deprived-adolescents-need-sleep-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":73.43,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":73.43},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":126342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8309661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300647,"mean":8.9513100523537,"rank":6943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":293703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300647,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1825,"mean":13.553726973684,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1825,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":20.603625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
