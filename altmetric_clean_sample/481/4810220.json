Janthinobacterium lividum colonizes the skin of some amphibians and confers protection against fungal pathogens. The mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood. In order to identify the advantages for the bacterium to colonize amphibian skin we sequenced Janthinobacterium lividum strain MTR, a strain isolated from Caj\u00f3n del Maipo, Chile. The strain has capnophilic behavior, with growth favored by high concentrations (5\u00a0%) of carbon dioxide. Its genome is 6,535,606\u00a0bp in size, with 5,362 coding sequences and a G\u2009+\u2009C content of 62.37\u00a0%. The presence of genes encoding for products that participate in the carbon fixation pathways (dark CAM pathways), and the entire set of genes encoding for the enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle may explain the capnophilic behavior and allow us to propose that the CO2 secreted by the skin of amphibians is the signal molecule that guides colonization by Janthinobacterium lividum.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc83","authors":["Valdes, Natalia","Soto, Paola","Cottet, Luis","Alarcon, Paula","Gonzalez, Alex","Castillo, Antonio","Corsini, Gino","Tello, Mario"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40793-015-0104-z","first_seen_on":"2015-11-26T11:10:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-3277"],"journal":"Standards in Genomic Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1448536217,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26605004?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26605004","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Draft genome sequence of Janthinobacterium lividum strain MTR reveals its mechanism of capnophilic behavior.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/draft-genome-sequence-janthinobacterium-lividum-strain-mtr-reveals-mechanism-capnophilic-behavior"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6611727,"mean":6.131580845607,"rank":5641711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6611727,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250365,"mean":9.2463385310987,"rank":198270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250365,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":390,"mean":1.9341696658098,"rank":330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":390,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.4011111111111,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
