Conventional ACTH therapy is administered short-term with efficacy, yet the relapse rate is high. Relapse after initial ACTH therapy is a poor prognostic factor for long-term seizure control and outcome of cognitive function. Here, we report successful long-term weekly ACTH therapy for relapsed WS in a tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) child after conventional ACTH therapy.\nThe patient had a series of epileptic spasms (ES) and hypsarrhythmia at age 3months. She was diagnosed with WS associated with TSC, and was treated with conventional ACTH therapy at age 4months, and a second course of ACTH therapy at age 8months. Both courses of therapy were transiently effective. A third course of ACTH therapy was started at age 1year and 2months, and long-term weekly ACTH therapy was continued thereafter. During this therapy, both ES and hypsarrhythmia remained completely resolved. Therapy was continued, and dose reduction was started when the patient was 2years and 10months old. No serious adverse events had occurred during this therapy.\nThis case demonstrated that long-term weekly ACTH may be safe and effective. Although at present, this therapy may only be considered for relapsed symptomatic WS patients, it may be a good alternative therapy when frequent relapses occur after favorable response to conventional ACTH therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002425","authors":["Nakata, Masatoshi","Kato, Takeo","Ide, Minako","Saito, Keiko","Yoshida, Takeshi","Awaya, Tomonari","Shibata, Minoru","Heike, Toshio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.braindev.2015.10.004","endpage":"434","first_seen_on":"2015-11-27T18:16:30+00:00","issns":["1872-7131","0387-7604","03877604"],"issue":"4","journal":"Brain & Development","last_mentioned_on":1483596050,"links":["http:\/\/www.brainanddevelopment.com\/article\/S0387-7604(15)00216-8\/abstract?utm_source=hootsuite","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26482603"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.brainanddevelopment.com\/article\/S0387760415002168\/pdf","pmid":"26482603","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"431","subjects":["brain","pediatrics"],"title":"Long-term weekly ACTH therapy for relapsed West syndrome in tuberous sclerosis complex: A case report","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-weekly-acth-therapy-relapsed-west-syndrome-tuberous-sclerosis-complex-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":3257359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4686990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294590,"mean":8.8411792157886,"rank":100073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":192199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294590,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":611,"mean":2.1684754098361,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":611,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":4.65,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JohnMillichapMD\/statuses\/670305103925092352","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4815358],"posted_on":"2015-11-27T18:16:05+00:00","author":{"name":"John J.
