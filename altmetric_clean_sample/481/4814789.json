In this paper we explore the potential of wing morphometrics for the diagnosis of FAR morphospecies and genotypic clusters. We considered a set of 227 specimens previously morphologically identified and genotyped at 16 microsatellite loci. Seventeen wing landmarks and 6 wing band areas were used for morphometric analyses. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance detected significant differences both across morphospecies and genotypic clusters (for both males and females). Unconstrained and constrained ordinations did not properly resolve groups corresponding to morphospecies or genotypic clusters. However, posterior group membership probabilities (PGMPs) of the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) allowed the consistent identification of a relevant proportion of specimens (but with performances differing across morphospecies and genotypic clusters). This study suggests that wing morphometrics and PGMPs might represent a possible tool for the diagnosis of species within the FAR complex. Here, we propose a tentative diagnostic method and provide a first reference library of morphometric measures that might be used for the identification of additional and unidentified FAR specimens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["Joannes Van Cann","Joannes Van Cann"," Massimiliano Virgilio"," Kurt Jordaens"," Marc De Meyer"],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.540.9724","first_seen_on":"2015-11-27T14:43:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1313-2970","1313-2989"],"issue":"540","journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1448636421,"links":["http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/articles.php?id=6226","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/zookeys.540.9724"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/lib\/ajax_srv\/article_elements_srv.php?action=download_pdf&item_id=6226","pmcid":"PMC4714084","pmid":"26798274","pubdate":"2016-01-23T22:00:39+00:00","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Wing morphometrics as a possible tool for the diagnosis of the Ceratitis fasciventris, C. anonae, C. rosa complex (Diptera, Tephritidae)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wing-morphometrics-possible-tool-diagnosis-ceratitis-fasciventris-c-anonae-c-rosa-complex-diptera-te"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6613942,"mean":6.1334676036573,"rank":4892939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":970513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6613942,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251104,"mean":9.2247048979901,"rank":170833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":52286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251104,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2107,"mean":14.228984805318,"rank":1705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2107,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":18.512211764706,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
