In this paper, we outlined a reinforcement learning method aiming for solving the exploration problem in a corridor environment. The learning model took the depth image from an RGB-D sensor as the only input. The feature representation of the depth image was extracted through a pre-trained convolutional-neural-networks model. Based on the recent success of deep Q-network on artificial intelligence, the robot controller achieved the exploration and obstacle avoidance abilities in several different simulated environments. It is the first time that the reinforcement learning is used to build an exploration strategy for mobile robots through raw sensor information.","altmetric_jid":"52d3d7f286a348c7778b4d4a","authors":["Lei Tai","Lei Tai","Ming Liu"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40638-016-0055-x","first_seen_on":"2016-12-23T08:08:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2197-3768"],"issue":"1","journal":"Robotics and Biomimetics","last_mentioned_on":1483894863,"links":["http:\/\/jrobio.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s40638-016-0055-x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jrobio.springeropen.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s40638-016-0055-x?site=jrobio.springeropen.com","pmid":"28066702","pubdate":"2016-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Behavioral Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Robotics and Automation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Systems Biology","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Mobile robots exploration through cnn-based reinforcement learning","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mobile-robots-exploration-through-cnnbased-reinforcement-learning"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019832,"mean":6.784478957969,"rank":3749722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4091326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019832,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256286,"mean":12.420699026474,"rank":122267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":127223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256286,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.4111111111111,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
