EDCs could be expanded from all atrial biopsy samples, but sufficient cells for cardiosphere culture were obtained from only 8 of 22 ventricular biopsies. EDCs from both atrium and ventricle contained a higher proportion of c-kit+ cells than CDCs, which contained few such cells. There was wide variation in expression of CD90 (atrial CDCs 5-92\u00a0% CD90+; ventricular CDCs 11-89\u00a0% CD90+), with atrial CDCs cultured from diabetic patients (n\u2009=\u20094) containing 1.6-fold more CD90+ cells than those from non-diabetic patients (n\u2009=\u200918). No effect of age or other co-morbidities was detected. Thus, CDCs from atrial biopsies may vary in their therapeutic potential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bbc","authors":["Helen H. L.
