In vitro and in vivo studies using pure compounds as substrates suggest that proanthocyanidins and the related catechin monomers may be degraded into more bioavailable low-molecular-weight phenolic acids by the microflora in the colon.\nThe aim of the study was to estimate the amounts of phenolic acids formed by the microflora and excreted in the urine of human subjects after consumption of polyphenol-rich chocolate.\nAfter consumption of a polyphenol-free diet for 2 d and a subsequent overnight fast, 11 healthy subjects (7 men and 4 women) consumed 80 g chocolate containing 439 mg proanthocyanidins and 147 mg catechin monomers. All urine was collected during the 24 h before chocolate consumption and at 3, 6, 9, 24, and 48 h after chocolate consumption. Aromatic acids were identified in urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and were quantified by HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.\nChocolate intake increased the urinary excretion of the 6 following phenolic acids: m-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, ferulic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, and m-hydroxybenzoic acid.\nThe antioxidant and biological effects of chocolate may be explained not solely by the established absorption of catechin monomers but also by the absorption of microbial phenolic acid metabolites.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["Laurent Y Rios","Marie-Paule Gonthier","Christian R\u00e9m\u00e9sy","Isabelle Mila","Catherine Lapierre","Sheryl A Lazarus","Gary Williamson","Augustin Scalbert"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-10T03:21:02+00:00","issns":["0002-9165","1938-3207"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1446602944,"links":["http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/77\/4\/912.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/77\/4\/912.full.pdf","pmid":"12663291","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Nutrition","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Chocolate intake increases urinary excretion of polyphenol-derived phenolic acids in healthy human subjects.","type":"article","volume":"77","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chocolate-intake-increases-urinary-excretion-polyphenolderived-phenolic-acids-healthy-human-subjects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8039046,"mean":6.825778771729,"rank":797547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7208821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8039046,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103186,"mean":10.614182662209,"rank":14480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":88378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103186,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5948,"mean":26.47793643854,"rank":2319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5948,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":48.937868852459,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
