However, little research is available on the ability of microsensor technology to be used across various sports or genders. Game video footage was matched with microsensor-detected collisions (GPSports) in one men's (n=12 players) and one women's (n=12) rugby sevens match. True positive, false positive and false negative events between video and microsensor-detected collisions were used to calculate recall (ability to detect a collision) and precision (accurately identify a collision). The precision was similar between the men's and women's rugby sevens game (\u223c0.72; scale 0.00-1.00), however, the recall in the women's game (0.45) was less than for the men (0.69). This resulted in 45% of collisions for men, and 62% of collisions for women, being incorrectly labelled. Currently, the automated collision detection system in GPSports microtechnology units has only modest utility in rugby sevens and it appears that a rugby sevens-specific algorithm is needed. Differences in measures between the men's and women's game may be a result of physical size, strength, physicality and\/or technical and tactical factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Clarke, Anthea C","Anson, Judith M","Pyne, David B","Clarke, Anthea C.","Anson, Judith M.","Pyne, David B."],"doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0000000000001576","first_seen_on":"2016-07-28T19:26:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1064-8011","1533-4287"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1490509804,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Proof_of_concept_of_automated_collision_detection.96353.aspx","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/_layouts\/15\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&issue=00000&article=96353","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/2017\/04000\/Proof_of_Concept_of_Automated_Collision_Detection.30.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/9000\/00000\/Proof_of_concept_of_automated_collision_detection.96353.pdf","pmid":"27467515","pubdate":"2016-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Proof of concept of automated collision detection technology in rugby sevens","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Proof_of_concept_of_automated_collision_detection.96353.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proof-concept-automated-collision-detection-technology-rugby-sevens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.65,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":1051598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7365458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260694,"mean":12.024869727994,"rank":45498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":215105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260694,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3918,"mean":16.25209803421,"rank":1666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3918,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":13.978718446602,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Scientists":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
