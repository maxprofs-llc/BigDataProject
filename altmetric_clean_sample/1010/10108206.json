This ability is strain dependent and involves multiple interactions between microorganisms and relevant host's cell populations. In the present work we focus on the effect of a potentially probiotic lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis CIDCA 133) in an in vitro model of Bacillus cereus infection. Our results showed that infection of intestinal epithelial HT-29 cells by B. cereus induces nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway. Noteworthy, the presence of strain L. delbrueckii subsp.lactis CIDCA 133 increases stimulation. However, B. cereus-induced interleukin (IL)-8 production by epithelial cells is partially abrogated by L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis CIDCA 133. These findings suggest that signalling pathways other than that of NF-\u03baB are involved. In a co-culture system (HT-29 and monocyte-derived dendritic cells), B. cereus was able to translocate from the epithelial (upper) to the dendritic cell compartment (lower). This translocation was partially abrogated by the presence of lactobacilli in the upper compartment. In addition, infection of epithelial cells in the co-culture model, led to an increase in the expression of CD86 by dendritic cells. This effect could not be modified in the presence of lactobacilli. Interestingly, infection of enterocytes with B. cereus triggers production of proinflammatory cytokines by dendritic cells (IL-8, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)). The production of TNF-\u03b1 (a protective cytokine in B. cereus infections) by dendritic cells was increased in the presence of lactobacilli. The present work demonstrates for the first time the effect of L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis CIDCA 133, a potentially probiotic strain, in an in vitro model of B. cereus infection. The presence of the probiotic strain modulates cell response both in infected epithelial and dendritic cells thus suggesting a possible beneficial effect of selected lactobacilli strains on the course of B. cereus infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8163cf058f61000bb85","authors":["Rolny, I S","Tiscornia, I","Racedo, S M","P\u00e9rez, P F","Bollati-Fogol\u00edn, M"],"doi":"10.3920\/bm2015.0191","endpage":"12","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T01:47:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-2891","1876-2883"],"journal":"Beneficial Microbes","last_mentioned_on":1469756827,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27459335?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27459335","pubdate":"2016-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"\n              Lactobacillus delbrueckii\n              subsp\n              lactis\n              CIDCA 133 modulates response of human epithelial and dendritic cells infected with\n              Bacillus cereus\n              .\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lactobacillus-delbrueckii-subsp-lactis-cidca-133-modulates-response-human-epithelial-dendritic-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":4329417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2256906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257607,"mean":12.019000481355,"rank":141491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257607,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227,"mean":7.8483451327434,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":19.49,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DCell_papers\/statuses\/758841252100005892","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10108206],"posted_on":"2016-07-29T01:47:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Dendritic cells","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/444106482712182784\/jm3fnA5u_normal.jpeg","description":"Journal paper feed for academics interested in dendritic cells, immunology and immunity (image source: NIH)","id_on_source":"DCell_papers","tweeter_id":"2386845055","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":247},"tweet_id":"758841252100005892"}]}}
