Our cell growth assays showed that under controlled hypoxic conditions, BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells rapidly became resistant to vemurafenib. By employing both a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid model and a two-dimensional (2D) hypoxic culture system to model hypoxia in vivo, we identified upregulation of HGF\/MET signaling as a major mechanism associated with vemurafenib resistance as compared to 2D standard tissue culture in ambient air. We further confirmed that the upregulation of HGF\/MET signaling was evident in drug-resistant melanoma patient tissues and mouse xenografts. Pharmacologic inhibition of the c-Met\/Akt pathway restored the sensitivity of melanoma spheroids or 2D hypoxic cultures to vemurafenib.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e0","authors":["Qin, Yong","Roszik, Jason","Chattopadhyay, Chandrani","Hashimoto, Yuuri","Liu, Chengwen","Cooper, Zachary A","Wargo, Jennifer A","Hwu, Patrick","Ekmekcioglu, Suhendan","Grimm, Elizabeth A","Y.
