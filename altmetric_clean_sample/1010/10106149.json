Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between vessels and adjacent perivascular fat tissue were calculated on the aorta and the coronary arteries. Dose-length-products (DLP) were recorded. Two blinded readers graded image quality of the aorta and the coronary arteries on a 3-point scale. Coronary artery stenoses were compared with coronary angiograms in 24 patients. Kappa values were calculated.\nHigh-pitch acquisition resulted in a mean DLP of 234\u00a0\u00b1\u00a093\u00a0mGy\u00a0cm(4.2\u00a0mSv) for an acquisition of the entire aorta, (mean 73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016\u00a0bpm). CNR for ascending aorta was 10.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 and CNR for coronary arteries was 9.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1. Image quality was excellent in 79\/84 patients (94%), and excellent or moderate but diagnostic in 1087\/1127 coronary artery segments (96%). 74 significant stenoses were observed, and 38\/40 significant stenoses were confirmed by coronary angiography (K\u00a0=\u00a00.91, Sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.97, Specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.98).\nHigh-pitch ECG-gated aortic CT with iterative reconstructions allows an accurate exploration of both aorta and coronary arteries during the same acquisition, with limited dose deposition, despite the lack of \u03b2-blockers and relatively high heart rate. Radiologists need to be aware of the necessity to analyze and report coronary artery disease in aortic examination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb6","authors":["Hachulla, Anne-Lise","Ronot, Maxime","Noble, St\u00e9phane","Becker, Christoph D","Montet, Xavier","Vall\u00e9e, Jean-Paul","Anne-Lise Hachulla","Maxime Ronot","St\u00e9phane Noble","Christoph D.
