According to theoretical investigations the trication contains quite polarized P-C bonds suggesting a substantial contribution from the dative bond model. As one of the resonance forms for the title compound depicted a hypervalent phosphoranide we also showed that phosphoranides, in general, do not contain a hypervalent P centre.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Nemanja \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107","Rakesh Ganguly","Milena Petkovi\u0107","Dragoslav Vidovi\u0107"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6cc04161b","endpage":"9792","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T01:57:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1364-548X"],"issue":"63","journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1470310245,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2014\/cc\/c6cc04161b#!divAbstract","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2016\/cc\/c6cc04161b"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/cc\/c6cc04161b","pmid":"27417223","pubdate":"2016-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"9789","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Bis(carbodicarbene)phosphenium trication: the case against hypervalency","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biscarbodicarbenephosphenium-trication-case-against-hypervalency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":4091682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3866848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257806,"mean":12.023836473303,"rank":129982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":117446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257806,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5858,"mean":3.0350722212737,"rank":2445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5858,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":4.1815154639175,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
