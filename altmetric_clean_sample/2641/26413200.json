The aims of this study were to identify known and novel ASD associated-CNVs and to evaluate the diagnostic yield of CMA in Thai patients with ASD. The Infinium CytoSNP-850K BeadChip was used to detect CNVs in 114 Thai patients comprised of 68 retrospective ASD patients (group 1) with the use of CMA as a second line test and 46 prospective ASD and developmental delay patients (group 2) with the use of CMA as the first-tier test. We identified 7 (6.1%) pathogenic CNVs and 22 (19.3%) variants of uncertain clinical significance (VOUS). A total of 29 patients with pathogenic CNVs and VOUS were found in 22% (15\/68) and 30.4% (14\/46) of the patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The difference in detected CNV frequencies between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (Chi square\u2009=\u20091.02, df\u2009=\u20091, P\u2009=\u20090.31). In addition, we propose one novel ASD candidate gene, SERINC2, which warrants further investigation. Our findings provide supportive evidence that CMA studies using population-specific reference databases in underrepresented populations are useful for identification of novel candidate genes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Areerat Hnoonual","Weerin Thammachote","Thipwimol Tim-Aroon","Kitiwan Rojnueangnit","Tippawan Hansakunachai","Tasanawat Sombuntham","Rawiwan Roongpraiwan","Juthamas Worachotekamjorn","Jariya Chuthapisith","Suthat Fucharoen","Duangrurdee Wattanasirichaigoon","Nichara Ruangdaraganon","Pornprot Limprasert","Natini Jinawath"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-12317-3","first_seen_on":"2017-09-21T17:00:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1506013237,"links":["https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-12317-3"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-12317-3.pdf","pmid":"28935972","pubdate":"2017-09-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"12096","subjects":["science"],"title":"Chromosomal microarray analysis in a cohort of underrepresented population identifies SERINC2 as a novel candidate gene for autism spectrum disorder","type":"article","volume":"7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446283,"mean":7.1010682364064,"rank":7298067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446283,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116830,"mean":11.819176659905,"rank":95354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116830,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37751,"mean":14.766228238411,"rank":31365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37751,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2469,"mean":12.290242301459,"rank":1944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2469,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/uranus_2\/statuses\/910911655462051840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26413200],"posted_on":"2017-09-21T17:00:37+00:00","author":{"name":"\u30de\u30fc\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\uff12\u4e16","url":"http:\/\/smetc.blog120.fc2.com\/?sp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/650483455248064512\/EOJq3sZX_normal.png","description":"\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3068\u3082\u5927\u5b66\u521d\u5e74\u6b21\u307e\u3067\u306f\u5834\u9762\u7dd8\u9ed9\u75c7\uff08\u81ea\u5df1\u8a3a\u65ad\uff09\u3060\u3063\u305f\u7537\u3002Twitter\u307e\u3068\u3081(http:\/\/psychobrain.seesaa.net\/)\u3002 \u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805\u2460\u8ad6\u6587\u306f\u8981\u7d04\u3057\u304b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u306a\u3044\u5834\u5408\u304c\u591a\u3044\u2461\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u2462\u79c1\u306f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002","id_on_source":"uranus_2","tweeter_id":"253847599","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3445},"tweet_id":"910911655462051840"}]}}
