Here, we report that cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated by a graphitic shell are broadly effective reductive amination catalysts. Their convenient and practical preparation entailed template assembly of cobalt-diamine-dicarboxylic acid metal organic frameworks on carbon and subsequent pyrolysis under inert atmosphere. The resulting stable and reusable catalysts were active for synthesis of primary, secondary, tertiary and N-methylamines (>140 examples). The reaction couples easily accessible carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones) with ammonia, amines or nitro compounds and molecular hydrogen under industrially viable and scalable conditions, offering cost-effective access to numerous amines, amino acid derivatives, and more complex drug targets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Rajenahally V.
