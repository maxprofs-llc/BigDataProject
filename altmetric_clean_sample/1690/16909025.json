Members of the HSP family mediate immune responses to tissue damage or cellular stress. However, little is known about the immune response induced by the oriental liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis, even though this organism is carcinogenic to humans. We address this issue in the present study in mouse bone marrow dendritic cells (mBMDCs), using recombinant HSP70 and 90 from C. sinensis (rCsHSP70 and rCsHSP90).\nrCsHSP70 and rCsHSP90 were produced in an E. coli system. Purified recombinant proteins were treated in BMDCs isolated from C57BL\/6 mice. T cells were isolated from Balb\/c mice and co-cultured with activated mBMDCs. Expression of surface molecules was measured by flow cytometry and cytokine secretion was quantified using ELISA. C57BL\/6 mice were divided into four groups, including peptide alone, peptide\/Freund's adjuvant, peptide\/CsHSP70, peptide\/CsHSP90, and were immunized intraperitoneally three times. Two weeks after final immunization, antibodies against peptide were measured using ELISA.\nBoth proteins induced a dose-dependent upregulation in major histocompatibility complex and co-stimulatory molecule expression and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, -6, and -12p70 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 in mBMDCs. Furthermore, when allogenic T cells were incubated with mBMDCs activated by rCsHSP70 and rCsHSP90, the helper T cell (Th)1 cytokine interferon-\u03b3 was up-regulated whereas the level of the Th2 cytokine IL-4 was unchanged. These results indicate that rCsHSPs predominantly induce a Th1 response. Over and above these results, we also demonstrated that the production of peptide-specific antibodies can be activated after immunization via in vitro peptide binding with rCsHSP70 or rCsHSP90.\nThis study showed for the first time that the HSP or HSP\/peptide complexes of C. sinensis could be considered as a more effective vaccine against C. sinensis infection as results of the activator of host immune response as well as the adjuvant for antigenic peptide conjugate to induce peptide-specific antibody response in mice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000883","authors":["Eun Joo Chung","Young-Il Jeong","Myoung-Ro Lee","Yu Jung Kim","Sang-Eun Lee","Shin-Hyeong Cho","Won-Ja Lee","Mi-Yeoun Park","Jung-Won Ju"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13071-017-2026-7","first_seen_on":"2017-03-01T23:36:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-3305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasites & Vectors","last_mentioned_on":1495013980,"links":["http:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13071-017-2026-7?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28249599?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28249599?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13071-017-2026-7?site=parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28249599","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"118","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Heat shock proteins 70 and 90 from Clonorchis sinensis induce Th1 response and stimulate antibody production","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heat-shock-proteins-70-90-clonorchis-sinensis-induce-th1-response-stimulate-antibody-production"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":3769444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4367635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237712,"mean":13.829455994884,"rank":111649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":122375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237712,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2288,"mean":3.7143979011806,"rank":936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2288,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152,"mean":2.6806092715232,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
