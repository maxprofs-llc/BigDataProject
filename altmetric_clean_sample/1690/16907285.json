Whether increased consumption of foods rich in antioxidants or supplementation with antioxidants can provide health benefits to people characterized by elevated C-reactive protein concentrations may be worthy of further study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002829","authors":["E S Ford","S Liu","D M Mannino","W H Giles","S J Smith"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.ejcn.1601667","first_seen_on":"2017-03-01T22:02:59+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0954-3007","1476-5640"],"issue":"9","journal":"European Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1496854800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.ejcn.1601667","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12947436"],"pmid":"12947436","pubdate":"2003-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"C-reactive protein concentration and concentrations of blood vitamins, carotenoids, and selenium among United States adults","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/sj.ejcn.1601667","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/creactive-protein-concentration-concentrations-blood-vitamins-carotenoids-selenium-among-united-stat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":8,"6m":8,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":776434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7544887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243097,"mean":13.714877217231,"rank":38024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":204811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243097,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2270,"mean":12.975999118554,"rank":583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2270,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":7.6585416666667,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
