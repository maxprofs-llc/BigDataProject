While early immunotherapies focused on accelerating T-cell activity, current immune-checkpoint inhibitors take the brakes off the anti-tumor immune responses. Successful clinical trials with PD-1 monoclonal antibodies and other immune-checkpoint inhibitors have opened new avenues in cancer immunology. However, the failure of a large subset of cancer patients to respond to these new immunotherapies has led to intensified research on combination therapies and predictive biomarkers. Here we summarize the development of PD-1-blockade immunotherapy and current issues in its clinical use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000847","authors":["Iwai, Yoshiko","Hamanishi, Junzo","Chamoto, Kenji","Honjo, Tasuku","Yoshiko Iwai","Junzo Hamanishi","Kenji Chamoto","Tasuku Honjo"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12929-017-0329-9","first_seen_on":"2017-04-06T10:26:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1423-0127"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Biomedical Science","last_mentioned_on":1504711768,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28376884?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12929-017-0329-9","https:\/\/jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12929-017-0329-9?utm_content=buffercc2b4&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12929-017-0329-9?site=jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28376884","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"26","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Cancer immunotherapies targeting the PD-1 signaling pathway","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cancer-immunotherapies-targeting-pd1-signaling-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":46.83,"score_history":{"1y":46.83,"6m":46.83,"3m":44.33,"1m":42.08,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":46.83},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8373007,"mean":7.0576589951014,"rank":200434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8172610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8373007,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249241,"mean":13.031129593965,"rank":12895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":236345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249241,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":377,"mean":4.2662340425532,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":377,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":16.083333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
