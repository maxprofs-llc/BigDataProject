In the current study, a battery of dispersion and precipitation-strengthened (DPS) NiMo-based alloys containing varying amounts of SiC (0.5-2.5 wt %) were prepared from Ni-Mo-SiC powder mixture via a mechanical alloying (MA) route followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS) and rapid cooling. Neutron Powder Diffraction (NPD), Electron Back Scattering Diffraction (EBSD), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were employed in the characterization of the microstructural properties of these in-house prepared NiMo-SiC DPS alloys. The study showed that uniformly-dispersed SiC particles provide dispersion strengthening, the precipitation of nano-scale Ni\u2083Si particles provides precipitation strengthening, and the solid-solution of Mo in the Ni matrix provides solid-solution strengthening. It was further shown that the milling time has significant effects on the microstructural characteristics of these alloys. Increased milling time seems to limit the grain growth of the NiMo matrix by producing well-dispersed Mo\u2082C particles during sintering. The amount of grain boundaries greatly increases the Hall-Petch strengthening, resulting in significantly higher strength in the case of 48-h-milled NiMo-SiC DPS alloys compared with the 8-h-milled alloys. However, it was also shown that the total elongation is considerably reduced in the 48-h-milled NiMo-SiC DPS alloy due to high porosity. The porosity is a result of cold welding of the powder mixture during the extended milling process.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bc","authors":["Chao Yang","Ondrej Mur\u00e1nsky","Hanliang Zhu","Gordon Thorogood","Maxim Avdeev","Hefei Huang","Xingtai Zhou"],"doi":"10.3390\/ma10040389","first_seen_on":"2017-04-06T12:30:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1996-1944"],"issue":"4","journal":"Materials (1996-1944)","last_mentioned_on":1491545278,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/4\/389?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/4\/389"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/4\/389\/pdf","pmid":"28772747","pubdate":"2017-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"title":"The Effect of Milling Time on the Microstructural Characteristics and Strengthening Mechanisms of NiMo-SiC Alloys Prepared via Powder Metallurgy","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-milling-time-microstructural-characteristics-strengthening-mechanisms-nimosic-alloys-prepared"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":6067470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1078457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235032,"mean":12.843370959575,"rank":167022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":42984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235032,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1020,"mean":0.90022963689892,"rank":437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1020,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290,"mean":0.55190311418685,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
