While of uncertain pathological significance for patients, the condition remains a major impediment for the clinical development of new drugs. Human Sandhoff disease (SD) is caused by inherited defects of the \u03b2 subunit of lysosomal \u03b2-hexosaminidases (Hex) A and B, leading to a large array of symptoms, including neurodegeneration and ultimately death by the age of four in its most common form. The substrates of Hex B, gangliosides GM2 and GA2, accumulate inside the lysosomes of the CNS and in peripheral organs. Given that both DIPL and SD are associated with lysosomes and lipid metabolism in general, we measured the hepatic lipid profiles in rodent models of these two conditions using untargeted LC-MS to examine potential commonalities. Both model systems shared a number of perturbed lipid pathways, notably those involving metabolism of cholesterol esters, lysophosphatidylcholines, bis(monoacylglycero)phosphates, and ceramides. We report for the first time that SD is associated with profound alterations in lipid metabolism in the liver. In addition, DIPL induced a wide range of lipid changes not previously observed in the liver, highlighting similarities with those detected in the model of SD and raising concerns that these lipid changes may be associated with underlying pathology associated with lysosomal storage disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d1d","authors":["Lecommandeur, Emmanuelle","Baker, David","Cox, Timothy M","Nicholls, Andrew W","Griffin, Julian L"],"doi":"10.1194\/jlr.m073395","first_seen_on":"2017-04-06T10:20:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-2275","1539-7262"],"journal":"Journal of Lipid Research","last_mentioned_on":1491481538,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28377426?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.jlr.org\/content\/early\/2017\/04\/04\/jlr.M073395.long"],"pmid":"28377426","pubdate":"2017-04-06T22:08:28+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Biochemistry & Molecular Biology (ASBMB)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Alterations in endo-lysosomal function induce similar hepatic lipid profiles in rodent models of drug-induced phospholipidosis and Sandhoff disease.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alterations-endolysosomal-function-induce-similar-hepatic-lipid-profiles-rodent-models-druginduced-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":3723957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4090147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234694,"mean":12.835538171143,"rank":110390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":117404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234694,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1417,"mean":4.1617782485876,"rank":719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1417,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":5.5976666666667,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
