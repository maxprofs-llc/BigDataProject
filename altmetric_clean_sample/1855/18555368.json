Transmission is zoonotic and\/or anthroponotic through the bite of an infected female sandfly. Control and elimination of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) require proper case detection, identification of reservoir hosts, and launching of effective vector control strategies in endemic areas. The aim of this review was to highlight the challenges in VL control in developing countries. Literatures pertaining to VL burden, diagnosis, prevention and control from the year 1969 to 2014 were systematically reviewed from PubMed, Scopus, Medline and Google scholar sources during July 2015. Poor vector control strategies, limited diagnostic services, drugs, treatments and lack of community awareness are the most important challenges in VL control and elimination especially in endemic areas. Absence of highly sensitive and specific tests, lack of trained man power, and community awareness are the major challenges in VL control. Therefore, proper case diagnosis, community mobilization and launching of effective vector control strategies in endemic areas are vital.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6ec3cf058f61000a00b","authors":["Hailu, Tadesse","Yimer, Mulat","Mulu, Wondemagegn","Abera, Bayeh"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-06T13:26:32+00:00","issns":["0972-9062"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Vector Borne Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1491485169,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27681541?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27681541","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Challenges in visceral leishmaniasis control and elimination in the developing countries: A review.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/challenges-visceral-leishmaniasis-control-elimination-developing-countries-review-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":6914535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234695,"mean":12.835478367576,"rank":191733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234695,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":1.383950617284,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.79166666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Mathematics":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/statuses\/849976521779404800","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18555368],"posted_on":"2017-04-06T13:26:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
