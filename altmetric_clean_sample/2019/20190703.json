However, the current companion diagnostics to predict response is so far suboptimal, since they base on more or less reliable immunohistochemical approaches. In order to overcome these limitations, we analyzed epigenetic modifications of PDCD1 (PD1), CD274 (PD-L1), and CTLA4 in NSCLC tissues from 39 patients. Results were correlated with transcriptome data. Significant differences in the CpG-methylation patterns between tumor tissues and matched controls were observed for CTLA4 and PDCD1 (PD1) showing a decreased methylation of these genes compared to matched tumor-free tissues from the same patients. Results were confirmed by bisulfide sequencing in an independent validation cohort. Hypomethylation also resulted in increased expression of these genes as shown by transcriptome data. These epigenetic pathways as a hallmark of NSCLC might be useful to generate more precise diagnostic approaches in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007fb","authors":["Sebastian Marwitz","Swetlana Scheufele","Sven Perner","Martin Reck","Ole Ammerpohl","Torsten Goldmann"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13148-017-0354-2","first_seen_on":"2017-05-16T14:35:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1868-7075","1868-7083"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Epigenetics","last_mentioned_on":1494950471,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28503213?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28503213","https:\/\/clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13148-017-0354-2"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13148-017-0354-2?site=clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC5426039","pmid":"28503213","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gene Function","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"51","title":"Epigenetic modifications of the immune-checkpoint genes CTLA4 and PDCD1 in non-small cell lung cancer results in increased expression","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-modifications-immunecheckpoint-genes-ctla4-pdcd1-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer-results-increa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":5944882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1976684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238576,"mean":12.362646815467,"rank":154904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":69782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238576,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":417,"mean":5.7801346153846,"rank":354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":417,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.0468,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
