The aims of this study are to quantify sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and changes in SOFA scores over time and determine its prognostic impact.\nThis is a prospective observational cohort study. We included 269 patients consecutively admitted to the ICU from the ED over 18 months. The SOFA scores at ED admission (ED-SOFA) and ICU admission (ICU-SOFA) were obtained. Relative changes in SOFA scores were calculated as follows: \u0394-SOFA=ICU-SOFA-ED-SOFA. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the \u0394-SOFA score: (a) \u0394-SOFA=0-1; and (b) \u0394-SOFA more than or equal to 2.\nThe median ED-SOFA score was two points (interquartile range: 1-4.5) and the \u0394-SOFA score was 2 points (interquartile range: 0-3). The \u0394-SOFA score was more powerful (area under the curve: 0.81) than the ED-SOFA score (area under the curve: 0.75) in predicting hospital mortality. Sixteen (6%) patients had a \u0394-SOFA score less than 0, 116 (43%) patients had a \u0394-SOFA=0-1, and 137 (51%) patients had a \u0394-SOFA of at least 2 points. The probability of being alive at hospital discharge was 51 and 86.5% in \u0394-SOFA of at least 2 and \u0394-SOFA=0-1 groups, respectively (P<0.001). Risk factors for an increase of two or more SOFA points were age, cirrhosis, a diagnosis of sepsis, and a prolonged ED stay.\nSOFA and changes in the SOFA score over time are potentially useful tools for risk stratification when applied to critically ill patients admitted to ICUs from the ED.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000734a","authors":["Garc\u00eda-Gigorro, Renata","S\u00e1ez-de la Fuente, Ignacio","Mar\u00edn Mateos, Helena","Andr\u00e9s-Esteban, Eva M.","Sanchez-Izquierdo, Jose A.","Montejo-Gonz\u00e1lez, Juan C."],"doi":"10.1097\/mej.0000000000000472","first_seen_on":"2017-05-16T19:47:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0969-9546","1473-5695"],"journal":"European Journal of Emergency Medicine: Official Journal of the European Society for Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1494964023,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/euro-emergencymed\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Utility_of_SOFA_and__DELTA__SOFA_scores_for.99263.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/euro-emergencymed\/9000\/00000\/Utility_of_SOFA_and__DELTA__SOFA_scores_for.99263.pdf","pmid":"28509709","pubdate":"2017-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Utility of SOFA and \u0394-SOFA scores for predicting outcome in critically ill patients from the emergency department","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/euro-emergencymed\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Utility_of_SOFA_and__DELTA__SOFA_scores_for.99263.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/utility-sofa-%CE%B4sofa-scores-predicting-outcome-critically-ill-patients-emergency-department-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":6236891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1105783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238575,"mean":12.362672856221,"rank":168797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238575,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":878,"mean":3.6671949828962,"rank":595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":878,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.6111111111111,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EJ_EmergencyMed\/statuses\/864567895178715137","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20197003],"posted_on":"2017-05-16T19:47:03+00:00","author":{"name":"EJ_Emergency_Med","url":"http:\/\/www.euro-emergencymed.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1801120310\/European_Journal_of_Emergency_Medicine_square_cover_normal.jpg","description":"Devoted to serving the European emergency medicine community and to promoting European standards of training, diagnosis and care in this rapidly growing field.","id_on_source":"EJ_EmergencyMed","tweeter_id":"482034086","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1414},"tweet_id":"864567895178715137"}]}}
