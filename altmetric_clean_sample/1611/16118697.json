In fact, many studies have contributed to unravelling the importance of the molecular clock for the regulation of our physiology, including hormonal and metabolic homeostasis. Here we will review the structure, organisation and molecular machinery that make our circadian clock work, and its relevance for the proper functioning of physiological processes. We will also describe the interconnections between circadian rhythms and endocrine homeostasis, as well as the underlying consequences that circadian dysregulations might have in the development of several pathologic affections. Finally, we will discuss how a better knowledge of such relationships might prove helpful in designing new therapeutic approaches for endocrine and metabolic diseases.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f4c","authors":["Davide Gnocchi","Giovannella Bruscalupi"],"doi":"10.3390\/biology6010010","first_seen_on":"2017-02-04T10:48:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2079-7737"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biology","last_mentioned_on":1487075150,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2079-7737\/6\/1\/10?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2079-7737\/6\/1\/10","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2079-7737\/6\/1\/10\/htm","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/biology6010010"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2079-7737\/6\/1\/10\/pdf","pmid":"28165421","pubdate":"2017-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Circadian Rhythms and Hormonal Homeostasis: Pathophysiological Implications","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2079-7737\/6\/1\/10","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circadian-rhythms-hormonal-homeostasis-pathophysiological-implications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208063,"mean":6.9506291146371,"rank":2089075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4996947,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208063,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265072,"mean":12.770649184558,"rank":92627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":167822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265072,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":3.0181472392638,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.589,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"CH":1,"FR":1},"mendeley":{"AT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PhiLifeSciences\/statuses\/827831152287244289","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16118697],"posted_on":"2017-02-04T10:48:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Phi Life Sciences","url":"http:\/\/www.philifesciences.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/785955844135407617\/tIqFI_Li_normal.jpg","description":"Phi Life Sciences is a Molecular  Diagnostic and Laboratory Service company.","id_on_source":"PhiLifeSciences","tweeter_id":"785955501959819265","geo":{"lt":32.77657,"ln":-79.93092,"country":"US"},"followers":176},"tweet_id":"827831152287244289"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/827831169290952704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16118697],"posted_on":"2017-02-04T10:48:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/913708571468210177\/oIecAg-R_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
