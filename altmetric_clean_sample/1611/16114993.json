This paper estimates the effects of women's police stations in Brazil on female homicides, a measure of the most severe form of IPV. Given that a high fraction of female deaths among women ages 15-49 years can be attributed to aggression by an intimate partner, female homicides appear the best proxy for severe IPV considering the scarcity of data on IPV in Brazil. We assemble a panel of 2074 municipalities from 2004 to 2009 and apply a difference-in-differences approach using location and timing to estimate the effect of establishing a women's police station on the municipal female homicide rate. Although we do not find a strong association on average, women's police stations appear to be highly effective among young women living in metropolitan areas. Establishing a women's police station in a metropolitan municipality is associated with a reduction in the female homicide rate by 1.23 deaths per 100,000 women ages 15-49 years (approximately a 17 percent reduction in the female homicide rate in metropolitan municipalities). The reduction in the homicide rate of women ages 15 to 24 is even higher: 5.57 deaths per 100,000 women. Better economic opportunities and less traditional social norms in metropolitan areas may explain the heterogeneous impacts of women's police stations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008969","authors":["Perova, Elizaveta","Reynolds, Sarah Anne","Elizaveta Perova","Sarah Anne Reynolds"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.socscimed.2016.12.008","first_seen_on":"2017-02-04T08:00:57+00:00","handle":"10986\/26003","handles":["10986\/26003"],"issns":["02779536","0277-9536"],"journal":"Social Science & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1486651867,"links":["https:\/\/openknowledge.worldbank.org\/handle\/10986\/26003?utm_content=buffer35a10&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10986\/26003"],"pmid":"28068577","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices","socialsciences"],"title":"Women's police stations and intimate partner violence: Evidence from Brazil","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0277953616306773","volume":"174","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/womens-police-stations-intimate-partner-violence-evidence-brazil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":4337533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2272346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264299,"mean":12.778242022262,"rank":150652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":87343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264299,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6164,"mean":9.4547035534642,"rank":5358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6164,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":20.630465753425,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
