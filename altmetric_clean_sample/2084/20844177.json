Although these types of vaccines have been successful in eliciting specific humoral immune responses to pathogen-associated immunogens, there is a large demand for the development of fast, safe, and effective vaccine manufacturing strategies. Radiation sterilization has been used to develop a variety of vaccine types, because it can eradicate chemical contaminants and penetrate pathogens to destroy nucleic acids without damaging the pathogen surface antigens. Nevertheless, irradiated vaccines have not widely been used at an industrial level because of difficulties obtaining the necessary equipment. Recent successful clinical trials of irradiated vaccines against pathogens and tumors have led to a reevaluation of radiation technology as an alternative method to produce vaccines. In the present article, we review the challenges associated with creating irradiated vaccines and discuss potential strategies for developing vaccines using radiation technology.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef7d2a83ee09648b53f5","authors":["Ho Seong Seo"],"doi":"10.7774\/cevr.2015.4.2.145","first_seen_on":"2017-06-06T06:52:08+00:00","issns":["2287-3651","2287-366X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical and Experimental Vaccine Research","last_mentioned_on":1496568341,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4524899\/"],"pmid":"26273573","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Korean Vaccine Society","startpage":"145","title":"Application of radiation technology in vaccines development","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-radiation-technology-vaccines-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":7191478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241189,"mean":12.212659046055,"rank":196476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241189,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.566,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
