However, the therapeutic mechanism underlying Salvianolic acid B has remained largely unknown. Our studies verified that Salvianolic acid B efficiently blocked mitochondrial deformation and dysfunction induced by H2O2 in the human hepatocyte cell line HL7702. Mortalin, a mitochondrial molecular chaperone, maintains mitochondrial morphology stabilization and function integrity. Previous results showed that mortalin overexpression has been observed in hematoma carcinoma cells and that mortalin maintains mitochondrial homeostasis and antagonizes oxidative stress damage. We found that Salvianolic acid B significantly up-regulated mortalin protein expression levels. In addition, Salvianolic acid B lost the function of preventing mitochondrial deformation and dysfunction induced by oxidative stress under mortalin knockdown conditions. We further found that mortalin overexpression increases the mRNA expression of mitofusin-related factor Mfn1 and mitofission-related factor hFis1. In conclusion, Salvianolic acid B maintains the mitochondrial structure stabilization and functional integrity by up-regulating mortalin, which may be associated with increased mitofusin factor Mfn1 and reduced mitofission factor hFis1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yunxia Liu","Yingying Hu","Qiukai E","Ji Zuo","Ling Yang","Wen Liu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep43097","first_seen_on":"2017-03-08T18:31:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1488997852,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep43097"],"pmid":"28251987","pubdate":"2017-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Drug development","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Salvianolic acid B inhibits mitochondrial dysfunction by up-regulating mortalin","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep43097","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salvianolic-acid-b-inhibits-mitochondrial-dysfunction-upregulating-mortalin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":7197991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242236,"mean":13.673450723471,"rank":201415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242236,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36324,"mean":14.727362167222,"rank":30351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36324,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3815,"mean":18.248009438909,"rank":3063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3815,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hepaticcellnews\/statuses\/839543958980165632","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17142122],"posted_on":"2017-03-08T18:30:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Hepatic Cell News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/812082306210893824\/sFNve1xh_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for the hepatic cell community.
