Here we review various aspects of MRI of reptiles, rodents, and lagomorphs, including the indications for this modality, the preparation of subjects, and protocols for imaging various organs and the musculoskeletal system. Protocols for the anesthesia and immobilization of subjects to facilitate their imaging are discussed also.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f7b","authors":["G\u0142odek, Joanna","Adamiak, Zbigniew","Przeworski, Adam"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-15T13:24:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-0820"],"issue":"3","journal":"Comparative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1465996317,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27298246?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4907530","pmid":"27298246","pubdate":"2016-06-15T22:01:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","laboratoryanimalscience"],"title":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Reptiles, Rodents, and Lagomorphs for Clinical Diagnosis and Animal Research.","type":"article","volume":"66"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7902020,"mean":6.6891515940364,"rank":6841931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7902020,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267774,"mean":11.502478681569,"rank":223477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267774,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":2.6289078014184,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/743068528346009600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8761940],"posted_on":"2016-06-15T13:11:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
