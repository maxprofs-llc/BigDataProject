These patients were noted as having a positive family history if they confirmed the diagnosis of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative. The outcome of interest was biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS). We used proportional hazards to analyze the effect of the presence of family history and other potential confounding variables (ie, age, treatment modality, stage, biopsy Gleason sum [GS], and initial prostate-specific antigen [iPSA] levels) on treatment outcome.\nEleven percent of all patients had a positive family history. The 5-year bRFS rates for patients with negative and positive family histories were 52% and 29%, respectively (P < .001). The potential confounders with bRFS rates were iPSA levels, biopsy GS, and clinical tumor stage; treatment modality and age did not appear to be associated with outcome. After adjusting for potential confounders, family history of prostate cancer remained strongly associated with biochemical failure.\nThis is the first study to demonstrate that the presence of a family history of prostate cancer correlates with treatment outcome in a large unselected series of patients. Our findings suggest that familial prostate cancer may have a more aggressive course than nonfamilial prostate cancer, and that clinical and\/or pathologic parameters may not adequately predict this course.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a18","authors":["Kupelian, P A","Kupelian, V A","Witte, J S","Macklis, R","Klein, E A"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-15T17:37:22+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0732-183X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1460536080,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9193343"],"pmid":"9193343","pubdate":"1997-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Family history of prostate cancer in patients with localized prostate cancer: an independent predictor of treatment outcome.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/family-history-prostate-cancer-patients-localized-prostate-cancer-independent-predictor-treatment-ou"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7546003,"mean":6.5175573163071,"rank":1404829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6111278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7546003,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264085,"mean":11.484696838884,"rank":65698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":197886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264085,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7901,"mean":12.878094683544,"rank":3072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7901,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211,"mean":34.667714285714,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Editorial: To PSA or not to PSA?","url":"http:\/\/www.bjuinternational.com\/article-of-the-week\/editorial-to-psa-or-not-to-psa-still-a-question-for-men-with-a-family-history-of-prostate-cancer\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[6647125,8767721,6647128,4818915,2546594,3078564,4818915],"posted_on":"2016-04-13T08:28:00+00:00","summary":"Family history (FH) has long been known to increase a man&rsquo;s risk of developing prostate cancer (PCa); there is an approximately twofold increased risk with an affected father and a threefold increased risk with an affected brother [1].
