We propose that a causal link exists between these three events. Mitochondrial dysfunction results not only in increased reactive oxygen species production but also in decreased iron-sulfur cluster synthesis and unorthodox activation of Iron Regulatory Protein 1 (IRP1), a key regulator of cell iron homeostasis. In turn, IRP1 activation results in iron accumulation and hydroxyl radical-mediated damage. These three occurrences-mitochondrial dysfunction, iron accumulation, and oxidative damage-generate a positive feedback loop of increased iron accumulation and oxidative stress. Here, we review the evidence that points to a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and iron accumulation as early events in the development of sporadic and genetic cases of Parkinson's disease. Finally, an attempt is done to contextualize the possible relationship between mitochondria dysfunction and iron dyshomeostasis. Based on published evidence, we propose that iron chelation-by decreasing iron-associated oxidative damage and by inducing cell survival and cell-rescue pathways-is a viable therapy for retarding this cycle.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f610004394","authors":["Mu\u00f1oz, Yorka","Carrasco, Carlos M","Campos, Joaqu\u00edn D","Aguirre, Pabla","N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Marco T"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/7049108","endpage":"21","first_seen_on":"2016-06-15T13:24:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090-8083","2042-0080"],"journal":"Parkinson's Disease (20420080)","last_mentioned_on":1465996824,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27293957\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27293957\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4886095","pmid":"27293957","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Parkinson\u2019s Disease: The Mitochondria-Iron Link","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parkinsons-disease-mitochondriairon-link"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8436356,"mean":7.0937825748122,"rank":3631040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4768077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8436356,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271908,"mean":11.704038711765,"rank":106223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":163659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271908,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219,"mean":4.1249357798165,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":8.8,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
