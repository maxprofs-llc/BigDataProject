However, until now a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon has been lacking. A two-phase distributed model is proposed to explain the bidirectional, concomitant transport of fluid, albumin and glucose through the peritoneal transport system (PTS) during peritoneal dialysis. The interstitium of this tissue is described as an expandable two-phase structure with Phase F (water-rich, colloid-poor region) and Phase C (water-poor, colloid-rich region) with fluid and solute exchange between them. A low fraction of Phase F is assumed in the intact tissue, which can be significantly increased under the influence of hydrostatic pressure and tissue hydration. The capillary wall is described using the three-pore model, and the conditions in the peritoneal cavity are assumed commencing 3 min after the infusion of glucose 3.86% dialysis fluid. Computer simulations demonstrate that peritoneal absorption of fluid into the tissue, which occurs via Phase F at the rate 1.8 mL\/min, increases substantially the interstitial pressure and tissue hydration in both phases close to the peritoneal cavity, whereas the glucose-induced ultrafiltration from blood occurs via Phase C at the rate 15 mL\/min. The proposed model delineating the phenomenon of concomitant bidirectional transport through PTS is based on a two-phase structure of the interstitium and provides results in agreement with clinical and experimental data.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002210","authors":["Joanna Stachowska-Pietka","Jacek Waniewski","Michael F.
