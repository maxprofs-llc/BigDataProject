Clinical data show that ticagrelor, a direct-acting, reversibly binding P2Y12-receptor antagonist, reduces total cardiovascular events, including stroke. In our present study, we investigated the expression of P2Y12 receptors and the effects of ticagrelor on brain injury in Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Rats were treated per os with ticagrelor 3\u2009mg\/kg or vehicle at 10\u2009minutes, 22, and 36\u2009hours after MCAo and killed after 48\u2009hours. Immunofluorescence analysis showed an ischemia-related modulation of the P2Y12 receptor, which is constitutively expressed in Iba1(+) resting microglia. After MCAo, activated microglia was mainly concentrated around the lesion, with fewer cells present inside the ischemic core. Ticagrelor significantly attenuated the evolution of ischemic damage-evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 2, 24, and 48\u2009hours after MCAo-, the number of infiltrating cells expressing the microglia\/monocyte marker ED-1, the cerebral expression of proinflammatory mediators (interleukin 1 (IL-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)) and the associated neurologic impairment. In transgenic fluorescent reporter CX3CR1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice, 72\u2009hours after MCAo, ticagrelor markedly reduced GFP(+) microglia and both early and late infiltrating blood-borne cells. Finally, in primary cultured microglia, ticagrelor fully inhibited ADP-induced chemotaxis (P<0.01). Our results show that ticagrelor is protective against ischemia-induced cerebral injury and this effect is mediated, at least partly, by inhibition of P2Y12-mediated microglia activation and chemotaxis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce7","authors":["Paolo Gelosa","Davide Lecca","Marta Fumagalli","Dorota Wypych","Alice Pignieri","Mauro Cimino","Claudia Verderio","Malin Enerb|[auml]|ck","Elham Nikookhesal","Elena Tremoli","Maria P Abbracchio","Luigi Sironi"],"doi":"10.1038\/jcbfm.2014.45","endpage":"988","first_seen_on":"2014-06-02T08:02:08+00:00","issns":["0271-678X","1559-7016"],"journal":"Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1401696115,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/jcbfm.2014.45"],"pmid":"24643079","pubdate":"2014-03-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"979","subjects":["metabolism","brain"],"title":"Microglia is a key player in the reduction of stroke damage promoted by the new antithrombotic agent ticagrelor","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microglia-key-player-reduction-stroke-damage-promoted-new-antithrombotic-agent-ticagrelor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3832388,"mean":5.0342199796355,"rank":3074190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3832388,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95319,"mean":7.4709039405767,"rank":75889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95319,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":759,"mean":4.305691292876,"rank":555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":759,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.3991627906977,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
