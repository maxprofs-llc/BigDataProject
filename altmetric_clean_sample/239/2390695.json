We investigated the influences of temperature (17 and 22 C) and salinity (25, 30, and 35 ppt) on the emergence of marine cercariae (Gynaecotyla adunca) from their mud snail first intermediate host ( Ilyanassa obsoleta ). Cercariae emerged in greater numbers at 22 C and the 2 lowest salinities, with a sharp decrease at the 35 ppt level, but there was no interactive effect. We discuss these patterns of G. adunca emergence as possible adaptations to facilitate transmission to its amphipod second intermediate host ( Corophium volutator ) in conditions common to the Upper Bay of Fundy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc2","authors":["Koprivnikar J","Ellis D","Shim KC","Forbes MR"],"doi":"10.1645\/13-331.1","first_seen_on":"2014-05-30T08:27:37+00:00","issns":["0022-3395"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1401438445,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24294898?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24294898","pubdate":"2013-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Effects of Temperature and Salinity on Emergence of Gynaecotyla adunca Cercariae from the Intertidal Gastropod Ilyanassa obsoleta.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-temperature-salinity-emergence-igynaecotyla-aduncai-cercariae-intertidal-gastropod-iilyanass"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":2319615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1557294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106299,"mean":7.7001066059569,"rank":52535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":36648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106299,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":800,"mean":3.4030538172716,"rank":569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":800,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":2.6157142857143,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/worm_papers\/status\/472293188774793216","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2390695],"posted_on":"2014-05-30T08:27:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Helminth papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/442964093498949632\/nwlIaKzr_normal.jpeg","description":"Automated paper feed twitter bot for academics interested in parasitic worms, gut parasites and anthelminthics","id_on_source":"worm_papers","tweeter_id":"2381877092","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":324},"tweet_id":"472293188774793216"}]}}
