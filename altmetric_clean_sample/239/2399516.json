In this paper, we report an investigation of the self-assembly of single- and double-tailed ferrocenyl amphiphiles (FTMA and BFDMA, respectively) at the surfaces of Pt electrodes and the impact of the dynamic assembled state of the amphiphiles on their rate of oxidation. We conclude that frozen aggregates of BFDMA adsorb to the surfaces of the Pt electrodes, and that slow dynamics of reorganization BFDMA within these aggregates limits the rate of electrooxidation of BFDMA. In contrast, FTMA, while forming assemblies on the surfaces of Pt electrodes, is characterized by fast reorganization dynamics and a corresponding rate of oxidation that is an order of magnitude greater than BFDMA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5683cf058f610004b08","authors":["John P E Muller","Burcu S Aytar","Yukishige Kondo","David M Lynn","Nicholas L Abbott","Muller JP","Aytar BS","Kondo Y","Lynn DM","Abbott NL"],"doi":"10.1002\/aic.14402","endpage":"1392","first_seen_on":"2014-06-03T10:31:16+00:00","funders":["niaid","nci"],"issns":["0001-1541"],"issue":"4","journal":"AIChE Journal","last_mentioned_on":1402441869,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24882870?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24882870"],"pmcid":"PMC4036740","pmid":"24882870","pubdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Resources Engineering And Extractive Metallurgy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1381","title":"Influence of the Phase State of Self-Assembling Redox Mediators on their Electrochemical Activity.","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-phase-state-selfassembling-redox-mediators-electrochemical-activity-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3896935,"mean":5.0206957016851,"rank":1951065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1755831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3896935,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96658,"mean":7.4562578789447,"rank":43585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":47236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96658,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194,"mean":2.3336875,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/assembly_papers\/status\/473773727943888897","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2399516],"posted_on":"2014-06-03T10:30:33+00:00","author":{"name":"assemblypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439371508528320512\/TDJfUNti_normal.png","description":"Papers on directed and self assembly","id_on_source":"assembly_papers","tweeter_id":"2364079946","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":332},"tweet_id":"473773727943888897"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WiscSTEM\/status\/476501851626426368","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2399516],"posted_on":"2014-06-10T23:11:09+00:00","author":{"name":"WiscSTEM","url":"http:\/\/www.wiscstem.com\/","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/485056099414839296\/Z2R3NXVQ_normal.jpeg","description":"Promoting Wisconsin Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics","id_on_source":"WiscSTEM","tweeter_id":"882801074","geo":{"lt":"43.074761","ln":"-89.3837613","country":"US"},"followers":1017},"tweet_id":"476501851626426368"}]}}
