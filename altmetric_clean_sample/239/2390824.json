Attempts to reproduce the synthesis of 1 from MoOCl3\/1,4-Me(SO3Me)C6H4 resulted in the good-yield formation of [MoOCl2(\u03bc-Cl)(\u03ba(1)-1,4-Me(SO3Me)C6H4)]2, 2. The 1\u2009:\u20091 reaction of MoCl5 with 1,4-Me(SO3H)C6H4\u00b7H2O selectively yielded Mo4O4Cl8[\u03bc3-1,4-Me(SO3)C6H4]4, 3. Compounds 1 and 3 were characterized by X-ray diffractometry; moreover DFT calculations were carried out on 1-3 in order to shed light on their thermodynamic and structural features.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Marco Bortoluzzi","Mohammad Hayatifar","Fabio Marchetti","Guido Pampaloni","Stefano Zacchini"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4dt00796d","first_seen_on":"2014-05-30T09:37:47+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"26","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1401442659,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2014\/DT\/C4DT00796D"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2014\/dt\/c4dt00796d","pmid":"24874424","pubdate":"2014-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"10157","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of di- and tetranuclear oxido-molybdenum(V) complexes containing p-toluenesulfonates as ligands: a joint spectroscopic, crystallographic and computational study","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-di-tetranuclear-oxidomolybdenumv-complexes-containing-ptoluenesulfonates-ligands-joint-spe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3533516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":135088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106299,"mean":7.7001000206966,"rank":81649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106299,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":1.0822622745491,"rank":6108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.6961538461538,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/status\/472310862611349507","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2390824],"posted_on":"2014-05-30T09:37:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"472310862611349507"}]}}
