Lycium barbarum fruit, commonly known as Gou Qi Zi in China, is a potential anticancer agent\/adjuvant. Its major active ingredients, L. barbarum polysaccharides (LBP), scopoletin and 2-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid (AA-2\u03b2G), are found to have apoptotic and antiproliferative effects on cancer cell lines. Moreover, LBP also contributes to body's immunomodulatory effects and enhances effects of other cancer therapies. It is not known whether there are any undesirable effects. Further studies on its pharmacological mechanisms and toxicology could facilitate a safe usage of this TCM herb.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aca","authors":["Tang WM","Chan E","Kwok CY","Lee YK","Wu JH","Wan CW","Chan RY","Yu PH","Chan SW"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10787-011-0107-3","endpage":"314","first_seen_on":"2014-06-03T01:07:11+00:00","issns":["0925-4692","1568-5608"],"issue":"6","journal":"Inflammopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1401550524,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22189914"],"pmid":"22189914","pubdate":"2011-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Allergology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Dermatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"307","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"A review of the anticancer and immunomodulatory effects of Lycium barbarum fruit.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-anticancer-immunomodulatory-effects-lycium-barbarum-fruit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3821406,"mean":5.0296322999739,"rank":420709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3392018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3821406,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95253,"mean":7.4423873304498,"rank":12945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":82118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95253,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":2.9943098591549,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
