The concurrent analysis of these lipid mediators is challenging because of their instability, differences in solubility, and the frequent occurrence of isobaric forms with similar fragmentation patterns. Results demonstrated that the reduction of SPE temperature to 4 \u00b0C is a critical parameter for preserving the hydroperoxy derivatives. Polymeric HLB cartridges increased 40-50 % ARA, EPA, and DHA sensitivity compared to C18 sorbent and also provided higher global performance for most hydroxides and other oxidation products. The proposed method for the two tested mass analyzers yields high sensitivity, good linearity, and reproducibility, with detection limits ranging 0.002-7 ng\/mL and global recoveries as high as 85-112 %. However, the additional advantage of the linear ion trap (LIT) mass analyzer working in full scan product ion mode, compared to the triple quadrupole (QqQ) operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), should be noted: the full scan product ion mode provides the full fragmentation spectra of compounds that allowed the discrimination of coeluting isomers and false positive identifications without additional chromatography development. The proposed lipidomic procedure demonstrates a confident, simple, and sensitive method to profile in plasma a wide range of lipid eicosanoid and docosanoid mediators, including innovatively the analysis of hydroperoxy congeners and nonoxidized PUFA precursors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224a","authors":["Gabriel Dasilva","Manuel Pazos","Jos\u00e9 M.
