Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients delivered by one maternal fetal medicine group from 2005 to 2012. We included 158 patients with a singleton pregnancy and a uterine anomaly, as well as an equal number of randomly selected unexposed singleton pregnancies delivered by the same group. Patients with uterine anomalies were subdivided into those with major fusion defects (unicornuate, bicornuate and didelphys) and minor fusion defects (arcuate, septate and t-shaped). Results: The incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes increased across unexposed patients, patients with minor fusion defects and patients with major fusion defects. These included preterm birth\u2009<\u200937 weeks, preterm birth\u2009<\u200935 weeks, birth weight\u2009<\u200910th percentile, birth weight\u2009<\u20095th percentile, preeclampsia, malpresentation and cesarean delivery. Conclusion: The incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes and cesarean delivery is increased in patients with minor fusion defects and is further increased in patients with major fusion defects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610004043","authors":["Fox NS","Roman AS","Stern EM","Gerber RS","Saltzman DH","Rebarber A"],"doi":"10.3109\/14767058.2013.847082","first_seen_on":"2014-05-30T07:20:40+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1433951492,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/apl\/mfn\/2014\/00000027\/00000009\/art00016","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24050215"],"pmid":"24050215","pubdate":"2013-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","perinatology"],"title":"Type of congenital uterine anomaly and adverse pregnancy outcomes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/type-congenital-uterine-anomaly-adverse-pregnancy-outcomes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5214302,"mean":6.1509615961972,"rank":3669381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":873272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5214302,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126556,"mean":7.9691498874008,"rank":83869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":24413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126556,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1070,"mean":1.963472404116,"rank":486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1070,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.5114893617021,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
