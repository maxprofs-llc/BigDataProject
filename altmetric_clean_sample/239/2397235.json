Diabetic wounds generally show compromised wound healing cascade and abnormal MMP9 concentration is one of the cause. Our group have recently shown that the polymorphism -1562 C>T in the promoter region of MMP9 gene is associated with pathogenesis of wound healing impairment in T2DM patients. In present study we have done expression profiling of MMP9 gene in the wound biopsy of DFU cases. Expression level of MMP9 mRNA was then compared with susceptible -1562 C>T genotypes (TT and CT) as well as with different grades of wounds. We also screened the promoter region of MMP9 gene to see the methylation state of CpGs present there. Our study suggests that levels of MMP9 mRNA increase significantly with the wound grades. Moreover, the MMP9 levels in diabetic wounds were also dependent on -1562 C>T polymorphism in the promoter region of MMP9. Diabetic wounds also showed a significant unmethylated status of MMP9 promoter compared to control wounds. In conclusion, The risk genotypes of -1562 C>T polymorphism along with lack of methylation of CpG sites in MMP9 gene promoter may result in altered expression of MMP9 in wounds of T2DM cases resulting into nonhealing chronic ulcers in them.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5a53cf058f6100052f8","authors":["Kanhaiya Singh","Neeraj K.
