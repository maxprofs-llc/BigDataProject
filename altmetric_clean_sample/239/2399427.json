Are you surprised?","Proton therapy for children"],"citation":{"abstract":"Proton beam therapy (PBT) is the most expensive form of radiation therapy in the United States. An area in which clear advantage has been modeled is the use of PBT for pediatric patients, although no publications deal with practice costs to PBT centers associated with a pediatric focus. Pediatric cases require longer treatment times and more staff members and incur higher supply and device costs. In addition to being more expensive to treat, the pediatric patients at the authors' center also present with Medicaid as their primary insurer at higher rates than adults. At their center, in the past 2 years, pediatric patients (<21 years of age) have constituted 32% of total patients treated. The authors present their cost experience in a PBT environment treating a large number of children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e95","authors":["Peter A S Johnstone","John Kerstiens"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jacr.2014.04.004","first_seen_on":"2014-06-03T10:15:15+00:00","issns":["1558-349X","1546-1440"],"journal":"Journal of the American College of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1444596346,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24881504?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.jacr.org\/article\/S1546-1440%2814%2900198-7\/abstract","http:\/\/www.jacr.org\/article\/S1546-1440(14)00198-7\/abstract"],"pmid":"24881504","pubdate":"2014-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Doing Poorly by Doing Good: The Bottom Line of Proton Therapy for Children","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/doing-poorly-doing-good-bottom-line-proton-therapy-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836001,"mean":6.6403769708981,"rank":1899613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":5918018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836001,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175606,"mean":7.2229125480484,"rank":44801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":130229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175606,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1511,"mean":8.7642993377483,"rank":702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1511,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":14.499,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4},"mendeley":{"US":1,"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/status\/473769813773283328","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2399427],"posted_on":"2014-06-03T10:15:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
