The objective of this study was to select 6 populations of H. contortus of known or suspected benzimidazole resistance status and characterize these using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) F200Y, F167Y and E198A in the \u03b2-tubulin isotype 1 gene. qPCR was performed using DNA from a pool of 10 adult male H. contortus from a single animal per farm. Faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and egg hatch test (EHT) were used to determine the resistance status. Samples were obtained from 6 farms located in 5 counties in the Cear\u00e1 State: Tau\u00e1, Boa Viagem, Quixad\u00e1, Santa Quit\u00e9ria and Solon\u00f3pole. The inbred-susceptible-Edinburgh (ISE) isolate was used as reference for comparative purposes in the qPCR. Benzimidazole resistance was detected by FECRT on all farms with efficacy values ranging from 0 to 51%. EC50 values as determined by EHT were all above 1.49\u03bcg\/ml. High frequencies of the resistant SNPs F200Y and F167Y alleles were detected but no resistance was detected at SNP E198A. Our results suggest that the SNPs F167Y and F200Y are both important for benzimidazole resistance in the studied populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fd","authors":["Santos JM","Monteiro JP","Ribeiro WL","Macedo IT","Camur\u00e7a-Vasconcelos AL","Vieira LD","Bevilaqua CM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vetpar.2013.11.006","first_seen_on":"2014-06-01T02:33:29+00:00","issns":["0304-4017"],"issue":"","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1401589988,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24295955?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24295955","pubdate":"2013-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Identification and quantification of benzimidazole resistance polymorphisms in Haemonchus contortus isolated in Northeastern Brazil.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-quantification-benzimidazole-resistance-polymorphisms-haemonchus-contortus-isolated-n"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":2319508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1557550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106256,"mean":7.7285129358619,"rank":52537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":36676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106256,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1267,"mean":1.8020789889415,"rank":588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1267,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":3.062275862069,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
