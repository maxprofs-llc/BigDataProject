Its administration has been associated with severe poisoning, sometimes with a fatal outcome in Nigerian children. Recently, we showed that several of the components of the concoction are toxic. We have demonstrated in the present study certain cardio-respiratory effects of cow's urine concoction in dogs. On the cardiovascular system, an initial bradycardia followed by tachycardia and a biphasic effect on blood pressue characterized by a fall followed by a rise were demonstrated. Progressive hypotension following repreated administration of CUPR was also shown in all experimental dogs. On the respiratory system, a short period of respiratory arrest and\/or respiratory depression, followed by tachyponoea with associated hypoventilation of the lungs, were observed. The possible explanations for the observed cardiorespiratory effects of the concoction were discussed. On the basis of our findings, an hypothesis is advanced for the possible mechanisms of the neurological sequelae and\/or death following cow's urine poisoning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005d24","authors":["R A Elegbe","D D Oyebola","R.
