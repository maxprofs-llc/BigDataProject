Evidence has emerged that the dose and composition of intravenous lipid products may alter the incidence of PNALD. However, other patient and PN-related factors, such as prematurity, birth weight, and gastrointestinal anatomy and function, are important. To improve neonatal care, future research on optimizing the content of PN and decreasing the incidence IFALD and CLASBIs is required.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005817","authors":["Kara L Calkins","Robert S Venick","Sherin U Devaskar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clp.2014.02.006","first_seen_on":"2014-05-31T10:02:17+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1557-9840"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinics in Perinatology","last_mentioned_on":1401530499,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24873836?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24873836","pubdate":"2014-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"W.B.
