The aim of this review is to summarize and highlight the most provoking findings indicating a potential causative link between brain tumors, specifically malignant gliomas, and viruses in the context of the concepts of viral oncomodulation and the tumor stem cell origin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8f","authors":["Alexander Kofman","Lucasz Marcinkiewicz","Evan Dupart","Anton Lyshchev","Boris Martynov","Anatolii Ryndin","Elena Kotelevskaya","Jay Brown","David Schiff","Roger Abounader","Kofman A","Marcinkiewicz L","Dupart E","Lyshchev A","Martynov B","Ryndin A","Kotelevskaya E","Brown J","Schiff D","Abounader R"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11060-011-0658-6","endpage":"466","first_seen_on":"2014-06-03T02:07:39+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1573-7373","0167-594X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Neuro-Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1426211844,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3278219","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s11060-011-0658-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21720806","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11060-011-0658-6"],"pmid":"21720806","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"451","subjects":["neoplasms","neurology"],"title":"The roles of viruses in brain tumor initiation and oncomodulation","type":"article","volume":"105","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/roles-viruses-brain-tumor-initiation-oncomodulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4866634,"mean":5.7962712002345,"rank":404124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4459540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4866634,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120439,"mean":7.8598660389579,"rank":13456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":106921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120439,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":805,"mean":1.959184079602,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":805,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.5413043478261,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
