They selectively review the literature on the subject and identify critical areas that require explication in terms of harmful versus nonharmful boundary issues short of sexual misconduct. These areas include role; time; place and space; money; gifts, services, and related matters; clothing; language; self-disclosure and related matters; and physical contact. While broad guidelines are helpful, the specific impact of a particular boundary crossing can only be assessed by careful attention to the clinical context. Heightened awareness of the concepts of boundaries, boundary crossings, and boundary violations will both improve patient care and contribute to effective risk management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002216","first_seen_on":"2012-08-06T21:51:33+00:00","issns":["0002-953X"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1344289796,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8422069"],"pmid":"8422069","pubdate":"1993-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"The concept of boundaries in clinical practice: theoretical and risk-management dimensions.","type":"article","volume":"150","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/concept-boundaries-clinical-practice-theoretical-risk-management-dimensions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":988758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75962,"mean":5.4033114098023,"rank":49737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":18635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75962,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3215,"mean":7.229364654636,"rank":2420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3215,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":6.361,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":14,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
