Eighteen fish (28.0 \u00b1 1.7 cm and 218.0 \u00b1 43.0 g) were divided into three groups of 6 and studied over 24 days with transfer to 5% (2)H-seawater after day 21. Over this period, one group was fed daily with fishmeal, a second group was fasted, and a third group was fasted for 21 days followed by 3 days refeeding. Glycogen turnover and sources were determined from the ratio of glucosyl position 5 enrichment to that of plasma water (H5\/PW). Glycogen levels of fed fish were significantly higher than fasted (665.4 \u00b1 345.2 \u03bcmol.g(-1) liver versus 77.2 \u00b1 59.5 \u03bcmol.g(-1) liver, P<0.05) while refed fish had comparable levels to fed (584.6 \u00b1 140.4 \u03bcmol.g(-1) liver). Glycogen enrichment of fed fish was undetectable indicating negligible turnover over 3 days. For fasted fish, H5\/PW was ~50% indicating that half of the glycogen had turned over via indirect pathway flux. For refed fish, H5\/PW was ~100% indicating that the indirect pathway accounted for all net glycogen synthesis. Direct pathway conversion of dietary carbohydrate to glycogen was not detected in any of the groups.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100025b3","authors":["Viegas I","Rito J","Jarak I","Leston S","Carvalho RA","Meton I","Pardal MA","Baanante IV","Jones JG"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbpa.2012.04.023","first_seen_on":"2012-08-03T19:44:52+00:00","issns":["1095-6433"],"issue":"","journal":"Comparative Biochemistry & Physiology Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1344023010,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22561667?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22561667","pubdate":"2012-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","physiology"],"title":"Hepatic glycogen synthesis in farmed European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) is dominated by indirect pathway fluxes.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatic-glycogen-synthesis-farmed-european-seabass-dicentrarchus-labrax-l-dominated-indirect-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75285,"mean":5.433579538813,"rank":48491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":15200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75285,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":366,"mean":2.6864547945205,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":366,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.7454666666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
