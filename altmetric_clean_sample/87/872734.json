We sought to determine the feasibility of having families, recruited at a child asthma visit, collect at home and return via mail child salivary samples, and whether socio-demographic variables were associated with sample return. For those returning samples, we examined whether past-year IPV exposure was associated with total cortisol output (AUC) and the magnitude of the cortisol awakening response (CAR), and whether these cortisol values were associated with asthma control.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002502","doi":"10.1016\/j.chiabu.2011.12.002","first_seen_on":"2012-08-04T10:05:09+00:00","issns":["1873-7757"],"journal":"Child Abuse & Neglect","last_mentioned_on":1344157969,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22858093?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22858093","pubdate":"2012-07-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Intimate partner violence exposure, salivary cortisol, and childhood asthma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intimate-partner-violence-exposure-salivary-cortisol-childhood-asthma-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":2972084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1399062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75385,"mean":5.3795935742332,"rank":46618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":26314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75385,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":703,"mean":3.7891054131054,"rank":552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":703,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.95,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
