Forty patients with vitiligo and 40 age and sex matched healthy subjects were studied. Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma Hcy levels and MTHFR polymorphisms were determined by chemiluminescence and real time PCR methods, respectively. Mean serum vitamin B12 and Hcy levels were not significantly different while folic acid levels were significantly lower in the control group. There was no significant relationship between disease activity and vitamin B12, folic acid and homocystein levels. No significant difference in C677T gene polymorphism was detected. Heterozygote A1298C gene polymorphism in the patient group was statistically higher than the control group. There was no significant relationship between MTHFR gene polymorphisms and vitamin B12, folic acid and homocysteine levels. In conclusion, vitamin B12, folate and Hcy levels are not altered in vitiligo and MTHFR gene mutations (C677T and A1298C) do not seem to create susceptibility for vitiligo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000271d","authors":["Yasar A","Gunduz K","Onur E","Calkan M"],"doi":"10.3233\/dma-2012-0908","first_seen_on":"2012-08-03T06:03:28+00:00","issns":["0278-0240"],"issue":"2","journal":"Disease Markers","last_mentioned_on":1343973731,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22846211?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22846211","pubdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Serum homocysteine, vitamin B12, folic acid levels and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism in vitiligo.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-homocysteine-vitamin-b12-folic-acid-levels-methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase-mthfr-gene-poly"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75284,"mean":5.4336683182126,"rank":48491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":15198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75284,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":2.0177795918367,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":3.075,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
