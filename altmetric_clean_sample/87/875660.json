TRAIL is a potent stimulator of apoptosis in cancer cells and an important immune effector molecule in the surveillance and elimination of developing tumours. However, many cancer cells are resistant to TRAIL-mediated death. In this study, we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which TRAIL resistance can be overcome in prostate cancer cells by 3,5-diprenyl-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (artepillin\u00a0C). Artepillin\u00a0C is a bioactive component of Brazilian green propolis that possesses antitumour and chemopreventive activities. TRAIL-resistant LNCaP prostate cancer cells were treated with TRAIL and artepillin\u00a0C. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Apoptosis was detected using Annexin V-FITC staining by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Death receptor (DR) (TRAIL-R1\/DR4 and TRAIL-R2\/DR5) expression was analyzed using flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential (\u2206\u03c8m) was evaluated using DePsipher staining by fluorescence micro-scopy. The inhibition of NF-\u03baB (p65) activation was confirmed with the ELISA-based TransAM NF-\u03baB kit. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities were determined by colorimetric protease assays. The results showed that artepillin\u00a0C sensitized the TRAIL-resistant LNCaP cells by engaging the extrinsic (receptor-mediated) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathways. Artepillin\u00a0C increased the expression of TRAIL-R2 and decreased the activity of NF-\u03baB. Co-treatment with TRAIL and artepillin\u00a0C induced the significant activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, as well as the disruption of \u2206\u03c8m. These findings show that prostate cancer cells can be sensitized to TRAIL-mediated immunoprevention by artepillin\u00a0C and confirm the role of phenolic compounds in prostate cancer immunochemoprevention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007977","authors":["Szliszka E","Zydowicz G","Mizgala E","Krol W"],"doi":"10.3892\/ijo.2012.1527","first_seen_on":"2012-08-07T00:42:51+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1344300078,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22735465?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22735465","pubdate":"2012-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Artepillin C (3,5-diprenyl-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) sensitizes LNCaP prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/artepillin-c-35diprenyl4hydroxycinnamic-acid-sensitizes-lncap-prostate-cancer-cells-trailinduced-apo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508238,"mean":5.1674528195662,"rank":3028753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":924324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508238,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76328,"mean":5.5326553382158,"rank":49262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":14219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76328,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1049,"mean":1.9626679389313,"rank":588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1049,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.1130434782609,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
