The authors argue that these only represent one form of marginality and that there are many other ways to be marginal within the group. The authors develop a dynamic model in which marginality is conceptualized as resulting from group and individual negotiation about inclusion (the Marginality as Resulting From Group and Individual Negotiation About Inclusion [MARGINI] model), and where individual and group inclusion goals can converge (resulting in relatively stable forms of marginality) or diverge (resulting in less stable forms of marginality). When the marginal position is unstable, individuals can either be motivated to move toward or move further away from the group, and such changing inclusion goals are associated with different emotions and behaviors. The authors argue that one needs to understand the interplay between individual and group inclusion goals to predict and explain the full complexity and diversity of the behavior of marginal group members.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032cb","authors":["Jolanda Jetten","Naomi Ellemers","Ellemers N","Jetten J"],"doi":"10.1177\/1088868312453086","endpage":"21","first_seen_on":"2012-08-08T17:15:18+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1532-7957","1088-8683"],"issue":"1","journal":"Personality & Social Psychology Review (Sage Publications Inc.)","last_mentioned_on":1438591200,"links":["http:\/\/psr.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2012\/07\/30\/1088868312453086.abstract","http:\/\/psr.sagepub.com\/content\/17\/1\/3.abstract","http:\/\/psr.sagepub.com\/content\/17\/1\/3.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psr.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2012\/07\/30\/1088868312453086.full.pdf","pmid":"22854860","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"3","subjects":["socialsciences","psychology"],"title":"The Many Ways to Be Marginal in a Group","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ways-marginal-group"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.668,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.668},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5436183,"mean":6.3250884403785,"rank":663153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4773043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5436183,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80978,"mean":5.8271668004495,"rank":9629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":71345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80978,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244,"mean":19.426098765432,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":15,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Ph.
