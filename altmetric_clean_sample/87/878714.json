Moreover, the nomenclature of human miRNAs changes rapidly. To address these issues, we developed a web-based system, miRSystem, for converting queried miRNAs to the latest annotation and predicting the function of miRNA by integrating miRNA target gene prediction and function\/pathway analyses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Lu, Tzu-Pin","Lee, Chien-Yueh","Tsai, Mong-Hsun","Chiu, Yu-Chiao","Hsiao, Chuhsing Kate","Lai, Liang-Chuan","Chuang, Eric Y"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0042390","first_seen_on":"2012-08-08T16:03:16+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1501684414,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22870325?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.scienceopen.com\/document?vid=6b1d9277-19b8-4455-9dae-73c8d16fc0aa"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.scienceopen.com\/document_file\/22b831d2-72e4-4c16-ab07-96194d77835a\/PubMedCentral\/22b831d2-72e4-4c16-ab07-96194d77835a.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3411648","pmid":"22870325","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"miRSystem: An Integrated System for Characterizing Enriched Functions and Pathways of MicroRNA Targets.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mirsystem-integrated-system-characterizing-enriched-functions-pathways-microrna-targets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":3818121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4412698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98143,"mean":6.0861850787635,"rank":40688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":56405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98143,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115009,"mean":10.603306848219,"rank":52490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":59884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115009,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3361,"mean":8.2924607142857,"rank":1492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3361,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Ph.
