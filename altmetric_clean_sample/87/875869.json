We tested the association between IS and genes differentially expressed between cases and controls, then determined which data mapped to previously reported linkage peaks and were nominally associated with stroke in published genome-wide association studies. We first performed gene expression profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 20 IS cases and 20 controls. Sixteen differentially expressed genes mapped to reported whole-genome linkage peaks, including the TTC7B gene, which has been associated with major cardiovascular disease. At the TTC7B locus, 46 tagging polymorphisms were tested for association in 565 Portuguese IS cases and 520 controls. Markers nominally associated in at least one test and defining associated haplotypes were then examined in 570 IS Spanish cases and 390 controls. Several polymorphisms and haplotypes in the intron 5-intron 6 region of TTC7B were also associated with IS risk in the Spanish and combined data sets. Multiple independent lines of evidence therefore support the role of TTC7B in stroke susceptibility, but further work is warranted to identify the exact risk variant and its pathogenic potential.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce7","authors":["Krug, Tiago","Gabriel, Jo\u00e3o Paulo","Taipa, Ricardo","Fonseca, Benedita V","Domingues-Montanari, Sophie","Fernandez-Cadenas, Israel","Manso, Helena","Gouveia, Liliana O","Sobral, Jo\u00e3o","Albergaria, Isabel","Gaspar, Gisela","Jim\u00e9nez-Conde, Jordi","Rabionet, Raquel","Ferro, Jos\u00e9 M","Montaner, Joan","Vicente, Astrid M","Silva, M\u00e1rio Rui","Matos, Ilda","Lopes, Gabriela","Oliveira, Sofia A"],"doi":"10.1038\/jcbfm.2012.24","first_seen_on":"2012-08-07T04:36:42+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1559-7016"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1344314102,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22453632?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3367223","pmid":"22453632","pubdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["metabolism","brain"],"title":"TTC7B emerges as a novel risk factor for ischemic stroke through the convergence of several genome-wide approaches.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ittc7bi-emerges-novel-risk-factor-ischemic-stroke-through-convergence-several-genomewide-approaches"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3081265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":962552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76324,"mean":5.444526656447,"rank":49416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":15982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76324,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":874,"mean":4.8600297823597,"rank":612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":874,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.6797,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
