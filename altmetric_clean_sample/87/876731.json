They contain DNA binding domains which belong to several super-families, each with a specific mechanism of DNA binding. The total number of transcription factors encoded in a genome increases with the number of genes in the genome. Here, we examined the number of transcription factors from each super-family in diverse organisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-7-239","first_seen_on":"2012-08-07T14:18:08+00:00","issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1344348990,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/7\/239\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2164-7-239","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16984633"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcgenomics\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-7-239.pdf","pmid":"16984633","pubdate":"2006-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Algorithms","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Combinatorial Libraries","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"239","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Coding limits on the number of transcription factors.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coding-limits-number-transcription-factors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4828923,"mean":5.7619065518173,"rank":3419792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":786756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4828923,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77701,"mean":5.6873881081081,"rank":51211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":13084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77701,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4444,"mean":3.7824006302048,"rank":3538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4444,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":4.6493835616438,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":40,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
