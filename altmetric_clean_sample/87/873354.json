The formation of tension wood is an important response to gravitational stimulus. Gibberellin appears to be involved in the differentiation of secondary xylem, but it remains unclear whether gibberellin plays a key role in the formation of tension wood and plant gravitropism. Therefore, a study was designed to investigate the effects of gibberellin and of inhibitors of the synthesis of gibberellin, namely paclobutrazole and uniconazole-P, on the formation of tension wood and negative stem gravitropism in Acacia mangium seedlings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002271","authors":["Ryo Funada"],"doi":"10.1093\/aob\/mcs148","first_seen_on":"2012-08-05T00:24:14+00:00","issns":["1095-8290"],"journal":"Annals of Botany","last_mentioned_on":1344126146,"links":["http:\/\/aob.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/07\/25\/aob.mcs148.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/aob.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/07\/25\/aob.mcs148.full.pdf","pmid":"22843341","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Gibberellin is required for the formation of tension wood and stem gravitropism in Acacia mangium seedlings","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gibberellin-required-formation-tension-wood-stem-gravitropism-acacia-mangium-seedlings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629479,"mean":4.9344089205159,"rank":2901015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629479,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72379,"mean":5.0601963027439,"rank":53299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72379,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":954,"mean":5.1482329485834,"rank":863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":954,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.50925,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
