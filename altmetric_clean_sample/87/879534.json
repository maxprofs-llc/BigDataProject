FZP withdrawal is correlated with synaptic incorporation of homomeric GluA1-containing \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the proximal stratum radiatum of CA1 neurons. After 2 days of withdrawal, Ca(2+)\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylates GluA1 subunits at Ser(831), increasing channel conductance. Secondary to AMPAR potentiation, GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), known binding partners of CaMKII, are selectively removed from the postsynaptic density (PSD). While activation of synaptic CaMKII is known to involve translocation to the PSD, CaMKII bound to NMDARs may be removed from the PSD. To distinguish these possibilities, the current studies used postembedding immunogold electron microscopy to investigate alterations in CaMKII signaling at CA1 stratum radiatum synapses after 2 days of FZP withdrawal. These studies revealed decreased total, but not autophosphorylated (Thr(286)) CaMKII\u03b1 expression in CA1 PSDs. The removal of CaMKII-GluN2B complexes from the PSD during drug withdrawal may serve as a homeostatic mechanism to limit AMPAR-mediated CA1 neuron hyperexcitability and benzodiazepine withdrawal anxiety.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000427b","authors":["Earl DE","Das P","Gunning WT 3rd","Tietz EI"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/405926","first_seen_on":"2012-08-09T05:54:51+00:00","issns":["2090-5904"],"issue":"","journal":"Neural Plasticity","last_mentioned_on":1344559283,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22830051?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3399473","pmid":"22830051","pubdate":"2012-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Regulation of Ca(2+)\/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II Signaling within Hippocampal Glutamatergic Postsynapses during Flurazepam Withdrawal.","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-ca2calmodulindependent-protein-kinase-ii-signaling-within-hippocampal-glutamatergic-posts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4703617,"mean":5.7135412588966,"rank":2098884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2554035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4703617,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77190,"mean":5.7020512508259,"rank":29050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":47163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77190,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":416,"mean":2.2289831325301,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":416,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.5183333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AttackAnxiety\/statuses\/233440755690139650","license":"public","citation_ids":[879534],"posted_on":"2012-08-09T05:53:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Attack Anxiety","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1725407908\/Anxiety_normal.jpg","description":"Anxiety (also called angst or worry) is a psychological and physiological state characterized by somatic, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral components.","id_on_source":"AttackAnxiety","tweeter_id":"451340505","geo":{"lt":48.602605,"ln":-93.403654,"country":"US"},"followers":274},"tweet_id":"233440755690139650"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Anxiety_Wisdom\/statuses\/233440758844252160","license":"public","citation_ids":[879534],"posted_on":"2012-08-09T05:53:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Anxiety OW","url":"http:\/\/www.organizedwisdom.com","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/875351154\/twitter_image_normal.png","description":"Organizing anxiety disorder resources shared by health experts, advocates, and organizations into WisdomCards.\r\n","id_on_source":"Anxiety_Wisdom","tweeter_id":"128460310","geo":{"lt":40.71455,"ln":-74.007124,"country":"US"},"followers":434},"tweet_id":"233440758844252160"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/psychoneurology\/status\/233724691100073984","citation_ids":[879534],"posted_on":"2012-08-10T00:41:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Alex Concorde","url":"http:\/\/www.XPlus-MYND.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/732876791\/brain_in_exploding_egg_cropped_normal.jpg","description":"Psychology & Neurology in Health, Wellbeing, Happiness, Subjectivity, Decisions, Complexity & Information-Processing, Interactivity, Performance, Enterprise","id_on_source":"psychoneurology","tweeter_id":"118876934","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":1781},"tweet_id":"233724691100073984"}]}}
