The mechanisms underlying these benign laboratory abnormalities are unknown. Forty-eight healthy men were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of unfractionated heparin (UFH; 150 U\/kg), enoxaparin sodium (1 mg\/kg), dalteparin sodium (120 IU\/kg), or adomiparin sodium (125 IU\/kg; a novel heparin) every 12 h for 4.5 days. Asymptomatic elevations in serum ALT or AST were observed in >90% of the subjects. Elevations were also observed in the levels of serum sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), miR-122, high-mobility group box-1 protein (including the acetylated form), full-length keratin 18, and DNA. Keratin 18 fragments, which are apoptosis biomarkers, were not detected. Biomarker profiles did not differ significantly across heparin treatments. We conclude that heparins as a class cause self-limited and mild hepatocyte necrosis with secondary activation of an innate immune response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000580f","authors":["Harrill AH","Roach J","Fier I","Eaddy JS","Kurtz CL","Antoine DJ","Spencer DM","Kishimoto TK","Pisetsky DS","Park BK","Watkins PB","A H Harrill","J Roach","I Fier","J S Eaddy","C L Kurtz","D J Antoine","D M Spencer","T K Kishimoto","D S Pisetsky","B K Park","P B Watkins"],"doi":"10.1038\/clpt.2012.40","endpage":"220","first_seen_on":"2012-08-03T19:27:40+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["0009-9236","1532-6535"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1343779200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22739141","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/clpt.2012.40"],"pmid":"22739141","pubdate":"2012-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"214","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"The Effects of Heparins on the Liver: Application of Mechanistic Serum Biomarkers in a Randomized Study in Healthy Volunteers","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1038\/clpt.2012.40","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-heparins-liver-application-mechanistic-serum-biomarkers-randomized-study-healthy-volunteers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630112,"mean":4.9307700568987,"rank":2015694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630112,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72217,"mean":5.0353664284923,"rank":34029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":26077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72217,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":977,"mean":3.2276741803279,"rank":596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":977,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.8674545454545,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
