Compared to individuals in different-sex married couples, individuals in same-sex couples were more likely to report difficulty seeing specialists, getting medical care when needed, and delays getting necessary prescription drugs. They were also more likely to report dissatisfaction with the level of respect shown by and time spent with providers. This study suggests that individuals in same-sex couples are more likely to face barriers to care and that individuals in same-sex couples have less positive perceptions of provider interactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100013cc","authors":["Joseph B.
