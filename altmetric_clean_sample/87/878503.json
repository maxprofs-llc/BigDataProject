To elucidate the processing of lightness underlying the articulation effect, the present study introduced transparency over a dark surround and investigated its effects on lightness of the target. The transparency was produced by adding a contiguous external field to the dark surround while keeping local stimulus configuration constant. Results showed that the target lightness did not change on the articulated surround when a dark transparent filter was perceived over the target, although it did on the uniform surround. These results suggest that image decomposition into a transparent filter and an underlying surface does not necessarily change lightness of the surface if the surface is articulated. Moreover, the present study revealed that articulating the surround does not always enhance lightness contrast; it can reduce the contrast effect when the target luminance is not the highest within the surround. These findings are consistent with the theoretical view that lightness perception on articulated surfaces is determined locally within a spatially limited region, and they also place a constraint on how the luminance distribution within the limited region is scaled.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"5666dff22a83ee92618b4585","authors":["Masataka Sawayama","Eiji Kimura"],"doi":"10.1068\/i0528","first_seen_on":"2012-08-08T14:04:46+00:00","issns":["2041-6695"],"issue":"8","journal":"i-Perception","last_mentioned_on":1344434538,"links":["http:\/\/i-perception.perceptionweb.com\/journal\/I\/volume\/3\/article\/i0528"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/i-perception.perceptionweb.com\/fulltext\/i03\/i0528.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3485856","pmid":"23145303","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Pion Ltd","title":"Local Computation of Lightness on Articulated Surrounds","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/local-computation-lightness-articulated-surrounds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/i_Perception\/status\/233201472962195457","citation_ids":[878503],"posted_on":"2012-08-08T14:02:18+00:00","author":{"name":"i-Perception","url":"http:\/\/i-perception.perceptionweb.com\/","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1884435799\/iplogo--twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Open access journal covering the Perception Sciences---all the senses and the perceptual processes of humans, animals, and machines.","id_on_source":"i_Perception","tweeter_id":"519746589","geo":{"lt":51.506325,"ln":-0.127144,"country":"GB"},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"233201472962195457"}]}}
