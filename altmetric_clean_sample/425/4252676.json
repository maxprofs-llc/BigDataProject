The secondary objective of this study was to compare subjective grading of pleural effusion size with thoracentesis volumes.\nThis was a retrospective study of 67 patients with free-flowing pleural effusions who underwent therapeutic thoracentesis. CT volumetric analysis was performed on all patients; the CT volumes were compared with the thoracentesis volumes. In addition, the subjective grading of pleural effusion size was compared with the thoracentesis volumes.\nThe average difference between CT volume and thoracentesis volume was 9.4 mL (1.3%) \u00b1 290 mL (30%); these volumes were not statistically different (P\u00a0=\u00a0.79, paired two-tailed Student's t-test). The thoracentesis volume of a \"small,\" \"moderate,\" and \"large\" pleural effusion, as graded on chest CT, was found to be approximately 410\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0260 cc, 770\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0270 mL and 1370\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0650 mL, respectively; the thoracentesis volume of a \"small,\" \"moderate,\" and \"large\" pleural effusion, as graded on chest radiograph, was found to be approximately 610\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0320 mL, 1040\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0460 mL, and 1530\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0830 mL, respectively.\nCT volumetric analysis is an accessible tool that can be used to accurately quantify the size of pleural effusions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067f7","authors":["Chiao, David","Hanley, Michael","Olazagasti, Juan M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.acra.2015.03.015","first_seen_on":"2015-07-07T18:54:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-4046","1076-6332"],"journal":"Academic Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1436294460,"links":["http:\/\/www.academicradiology.org\/article\/S1076-6332(15)00199-3\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.academicradiology.org\/article\/S1076633215001993\/pdf","pmid":"26112055","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"CT Volumetric Analysis of Pleural Effusions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ct-volumetric-analysis-pleural-effusions-comparison-thoracentesis-volumes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325534,"mean":6.2412730147394,"rank":3528147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1576205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325534,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185955,"mean":8.4813122707768,"rank":120565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":56526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185955,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":464,"mean":3.7013088552916,"rank":304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":464,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.5,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SCBTMR1\/status\/618489888955088896","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4252676],"posted_on":"2015-07-07T18:40:55+00:00","author":{"name":"SCBT-MR","url":"http:\/\/www.scbtmr.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3002800972\/515f88c7bac62a1f29a4886c8a453c6c_normal.jpeg","description":"Society of Computed Assisted Tomography & Magnetic Resonance.
