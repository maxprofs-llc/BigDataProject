Complementary measures of whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging investigations were combined to compare functional architecture of brain networks both at connectional and topological levels in 22 decliners to 22 nondecliners; episodic memory decline being assessed through a multiple time point Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test. The decliners presented differences in functional architecture centered on the posterior cingulate cortex, characterized by a significant decrease of connectivity intensity, a significant increased centrality. In accordance, a decrease of the functional connectivity inside the default mode network was observed in the decliners. Our results highlight the central role of the posterior cingulate cortex in a slow but reliable memory decline in elderly. Because functional alterations of this region are currently described in Alzheimer's disease, this functional signature could constitute a risk for Alzheimer's disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000318e","authors":["Bernard, Charlotte","Dilharreguy, Bixente","Helmer, Catherine","Chanraud, Sandra","Amieva, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","Dartigues, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois","Allard, Mich\u00e8le","Catheline, Gw\u00e9na\u00eblle"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neurobiolaging.2015.07.002","first_seen_on":"2015-07-09T04:25:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0197-4580","1558-1497"],"journal":"Neurobiology of Aging","last_mentioned_on":1438905600,"links":["http:\/\/www.neurobiologyofaging.org\/article\/S0197-4580(15)00358-9\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26234756"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.neurobiologyofaging.org\/article\/S0197458015003589\/pdf","pmid":"26234756","pubdate":"2015-08-05T22:02:24+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"PCC characteristics at rest in 10-year memory decliners.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pcc-characteristics-rest-10year-memory-decliners"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450695,"mean":6.347149723687,"rank":542701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4885030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450695,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187520,"mean":8.5154374970004,"rank":27176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":159691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187520,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1533,"mean":7.2847793733681,"rank":330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1533,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":10.236571428571,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
