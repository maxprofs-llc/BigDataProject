The MIPs exhibited better selectivity to ractopamine than to the dummy-template molecule: the imprint factor for ractopamine was 8.9, while 7.6 for ritodrine. The MIPs were used as sorbents in solid-phase extraction for selective enrichment of ractopamine, and some key parameters were optimized. After that, a rapid surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy method was developed for analysis of ractopamine and isoxuprine in pig tissue samples. Under the optimal conditions, good linearity was achieved in the range of 20.0-200.0\u03bcg\/L for ractopamine and isoxsuprine at 842cm(-1) and 993cm(-1), respectively. The limits of detection were 3.1-4.3\u03bcg\/L, which were lower than the maximum allowed by U. S. Food and Drug Administration. The recoveries of ractopamine and isoxsuprine were 72.4-79.7% and 71.0-78.2% for the spiked pork and pig liver, respectively, while the relative standard deviations ranging from 7.4% to 13.0%. The results suggest that the proposed method is sensitive and selective, and it has good potential on the quantitative analysis of trace amounts of \u03b2-agonists in complex samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003609","authors":["Xiao, Xiaohua","Yan, Kuanglin","Xu, Xianfang","Li, Gongke"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.talanta.2015.02.003","first_seen_on":"2015-07-07T15:45:51+00:00","issns":["1873-3573","00399140"],"journal":"Talanta","last_mentioned_on":1436283940,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0039914015000740"],"pmid":"25863369","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Rapid analysis of ractopamine in pig tissues by dummy-template imprinted solid-phase extraction coupling with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy ","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapid-analysis-ractopamine-pig-tissues-dummytemplate-imprinted-solidphase-extraction-coupling-surfac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325307,"mean":6.2415772840095,"rank":3749231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":891435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325307,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185950,"mean":8.4823851701275,"rank":129432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185950,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1151,"mean":1.2054173913043,"rank":524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1151,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.54545454545455,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
