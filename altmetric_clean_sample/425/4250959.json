Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) recognizes double-stranded RNA, a virus-associated molecular pattern. Activation of TLR-3 with Poly(I:C), a synthetic agonist, modulates tissue repair and permeability in other epithelia; however, the effects of local luminal TLR-3 agonists on gut barrier function are unknown. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate short-term effects of Poly(I:C) on rat ileal and colonic permeability ex vivo. We also studied the acute effects of intrarectal administration of Poly(I:C) on colonic barrier function. Ileum tissues displayed decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) 1h after incubation with 200\u03bcg\/mL Poly(I:C); however, the mucosa-to-serosa transit of macromolecules (4.4 and 40kD dextrans - TD4.4 and FD40, respectively) remained unchanged. Conversely, colon tissue preparations stimulated with 200\u03bcg\/mL Poly(I:C) showed a decreased thinning of the mucosal layer after 2h and a decreased transit of FD40 after 3h, in comparison to controls. There was no change in colonic TEER after 3h of treatment. In addition, colon tissue taken from rats 6h after an intrarectal administration of 100\u03bcg Poly(I:C) also showed decreased permeability to FD40 in the everted gut sac assay at 3h post-extraction. Tissue morphology remained unchanged. Our results suggest that an acute exposure to Poly(I:C) reduces colon permeability to macromolecules but increases ileum permeability to electrolytes\/small molecules ex vivo. Although the mechanism associated to these effects needs further investigation, to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct effect of a TLR-3 ligand in intestinal barrier function and may be of significance to understand region-specific interactions between gut mucosa and microbiota.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032df","authors":["Moyano-Porcile, Valentina","Olavarr\u00eda-Ram\u00edrez, Loreto","Gonz\u00e1lez-Arancibia, Camila","Bravo, Javier A","Julio-Pieper, Marcela"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.phrs.2015.06.016","first_seen_on":"2015-07-07T10:27:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-1186","10436618"],"journal":"Pharmacological Research","last_mentioned_on":1447943582,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26145280?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26145280","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1043661815001309"],"pmid":"26145280","pubdate":"2015-07-07T22:03:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Short-term effects of Poly(I:C) on gut permeability ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shortterm-effects-polyic-gut-permeability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6585900,"mean":6.1107691393388,"rank":1236562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5342829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6585900,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195984,"mean":8.5843213850183,"rank":49654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":146053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195984,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":587,"mean":5.0189010238908,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":587,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.462,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
