The DEMentia Digital Interactive Social Chart (DEM-DISC) is an ICT tool to support customized disease management in dementia. The aim of this study was to improve and evaluate DEM-DISC, its user-friendliness and usefulness and to investigate the future implementation.\nA cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) design was used with measurements at baseline, 6 and 12 months. A total of 73 informal caregivers of people with dementia, supported by 19 randomized case managers participated in the study. In the intervention group, both carers (n = 41) and case managers (n = 13) could access DEM-DISC during twelve months. The control group, 32 carers and 14 case managers, had no access to DEM-DISC. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten stakeholders.\nInformal caregivers who used DEM-DISC for twelve months reported an increased sense of competence than controls. A subgroup of users who frequently accessed DEM-DISC reported more met needs after six months than controls. Overall informal caregivers and case managers judged DEM-DISC as easy to learn and user-friendly.\nThis study demonstrates that using DEM-DISC had a positive effect on the sense of competence and experienced (met) needs of informal carers. This shows the importance of user-friendly ICT solutions to assist carers in finding appropriate care services tailored to their specific situation and needs. For further implementation of DEM-DISC methods to keep the information updated is of great importance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e83cf058f6100059c1","authors":["Van Mierlo, Lisa D","Meiland, Franka J M","Van de Ven, Peter M","Van Hout, Hein P J","Dr\u00f6es, Rose-Marie","Lisa D.\u00a0Van Mierlo","Franka J.M.\u00a0Meiland","Peter M.\u00a0Van de Ven","Hein P.J.\u00a0Van Hout","Rose-Marie\u00a0Dr\u00f6es"],"doi":"10.1017\/s1041610215000423","first_seen_on":"2015-07-07T09:54:28+00:00","issns":["1741-203X"],"issue":"08","journal":"International Psychogeriatrics","last_mentioned_on":1436276177,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?aid=9831249&fromPage=online","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9831249&utm_source=Issue_Alert&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=IPG"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S1041610215000423","pmid":"25872457","pubdate":"2015-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["geriatrics","psychiatry"],"title":"Evaluation of DEM-DISC, customized e-advice on health and social support services for informal carers and case managers of people with dementia; a cluster randomized trial","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-demdisc-customized-eadvice-health-social-support-services-informal-carers-case-managers-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325534,"mean":6.2412730147394,"rank":3528143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1576208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325534,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185955,"mean":8.4813093130561,"rank":120565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":56527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185955,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1038,"mean":2.9000906460945,"rank":470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1038,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":3.929,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
