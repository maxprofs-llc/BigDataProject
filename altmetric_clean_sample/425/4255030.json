An important strategy to define therapeutically relevant targets in these situations is to ascertain which genes are amplified at the protein level and, concomitantly, are key drivers for tumor growth and\/or maintenance. Furthermore, so called passenger genes that are amplified with driver genes and a manifest on the cell surface can be attractive targets for an antibody - drug conjugate approach (ADC). We employed a tandem mass spec proteomics approach using tumor cell lines to identify cell surface proteins whose expression correlates with the 11q13 amplicon. The 11q13 amplicon is one of the most frequently amplified chromosomal regions in human cancer being present in 45% of head and neck and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and 13-21% of breast and liver carcinomas. Using a panel of tumor cell lines with defined 11q13 genomic amplification, we identified membrane proteins that are differentially expressed in an 11q13 amplified cell line panel using membrane enriched proteomic profiling. We found that DSG3, CD109 and CD14 were differentially overexpressed in head and neck and breast tumor cells with 11q13 amplification. The level of protein expression of each gene was confirmed by western blot and FACS analysis. Since proteins with high cell surface expression on selected tumor cells could be potential antibody drug conjugate targets, we tested DSG3 and CD109 in antibody piggyback assays and validated that DSG3 and CD109 expression was sufficient to induce antibody internalization and cell killing in 11q13 amplified cell lines. Our results suggest that proteomic profiling using genetically stratified tumors can identify candidate antibody drug conjugate targets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e0f","authors":["Hoover, Heather","Li, Jun","Marchese, Jason","Rothwell, Christopher","Borawski, Jason","Jeffery, Douglas A","Gaither, L Alex","Finkel, Nancy"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jproteome.5b00508","first_seen_on":"2015-07-08T11:44:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-3907"],"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","last_mentioned_on":1438215484,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26151158?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jproteome.5b00508"],"pmid":"26151158","pubdate":"2015-07-08T22:01:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Quantitative Proteomic Verification of Membrane Proteins as Potential Therapeutic Targets Located in the 11q13 Amplicon in Cancers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-proteomic-verification-membrane-proteins-potential-therapeutic-targets-located-11q13-am"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422382,"mean":6.3136344723843,"rank":3815849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":910544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422382,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187536,"mean":8.4947100221293,"rank":130410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187536,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2390,"mean":3.0469778149853,"rank":1804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2390,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":3.5687118644068,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/status\/618746630066450432","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4255030],"posted_on":"2015-07-08T11:41:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"618746630066450432"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PastelBio_prot\/status\/626547271476232192","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4255030],"posted_on":"2015-07-30T00:18:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Pastel BioScience","url":"http:\/\/pastelbioscience.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/517427681470595072\/rIICwBZ0_normal.png","description":"Proteomics articles feed incl.
