We investigate if the creation of new composite textures from the combination of FDG-PET and MR imaging information could better identify aggressive tumours. Towards this goal, a cohort of 51 patients with histologically proven STSs of the extremities was retrospectively evaluated. All patients had pre-treatment FDG-PET and MRI scans comprised of T1-weighted and T2-weighted fat-suppression sequences (T2FS). Nine non-texture features (SUV metrics and shape features) and forty-one texture features were extracted from the tumour region of separate (FDG-PET, T1 and T2FS) and fused (FDG-PET\/T1 and FDG-PET\/T2FS) scans. Volume fusion of the FDG-PET and MRI scans was implemented using the wavelet transform. The influence of six different extraction parameters on the predictive value of textures was investigated. The incorporation of features into multivariable models was performed using logistic regression. The multivariable modeling strategy involved imbalance-adjusted bootstrap resampling in the following four steps leading to final prediction model construction: (1) feature set reduction; (2) feature selection; (3) prediction performance estimation; and (4) computation of model coefficients. Univariate analysis showed that the isotropic voxel size at which texture features were extracted had the most impact on predictive value. In multivariable analysis, texture features extracted from fused scans significantly outperformed those from separate scans in terms of lung metastases prediction estimates. The best performance was obtained using a combination of four texture features extracted from FDG-PET\/T1 and FDG-PET\/T2FS scans. This model reached an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.984\u2009\u00b1\u20090.002, a sensitivity of 0.955\u2009\u00b1\u20090.006, and a specificity of 0.926\u2009\u00b1\u20090.004 in bootstrapping evaluations. Ultimately, lung metastasis risk assessment at diagnosis of STSs could improve patient outcomes by allowing better treatment adaptation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000330e","authors":["M Valli\u00e8res","C R Freeman","S R Skamene","I El Naqa","Valli\u00e8res, M","Freeman, C R","Skamene, S R","El Naqa, I"],"doi":"10.1088\/0031-9155\/60\/14\/5471","endpage":"5496","first_seen_on":"2015-07-09T00:20:17+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1361-6560","0031-9155"],"issue":"14","journal":"Physics in Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1460149660,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0031-9155\/60\/14\/5471\/email-alert\/1144875731","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0031-9155\/60\/14\/5471#.VbPBUvIBGiA.linkedin","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1088\/0031-9155\/60\/14\/5471","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0031-9155\/60\/14\/5471"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0031-9155\/60\/14\/5471\/pdf\/0031-9155_60_14_5471.pdf","pmid":"26119045","pubdate":"2015-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"5471","subjects":["biophysics","biology"],"title":"A radiomics model from joint FDG-PET and MRI texture features for the prediction of lung metastases in soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiomics-model-joint-fdgpet-mri-texture-features-prediction-lung-metastases-softtissue-sarcomas-ext"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":1515671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5994022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223495,"mean":8.0699329646435,"rank":54693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":168357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223495,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1294,"mean":2.1533225058005,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":1164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1294,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":1.3287234042553,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":45,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
