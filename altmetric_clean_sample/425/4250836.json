The absence of known correlates of protection induced by LAIV requires human studies of underlying mechanisms of vaccine-induced immunity, to further elucidate the immunological processes occurring. In this study, children scheduled for elective tonsillectomy were enrolled in a clinical trial to evaluate the immune response to LAIV, in order to compare T and B cell gene expression profiles. Twenty-three children (aged 3-17\u00a0years) were divided into 4 groups; unvaccinated controls, or vaccinated intranasally with LAIV at days 3-4, 6-7, and 12-15 before tonsillectomy. Total RNA extraction was performed on tonsillar tissue and high RNA quality was assured. The samples were then analyzed using a validated RT2 Profiler PCR Array containing 84 gene-specific primers involved in B and T cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, regulation and polarization. The gene expression after LAIV vaccination was subsequently compared to the controls. We observed that at d 3-4 post vaccination, 6 genes were down-regulated, namely APC, CD3G, FASLG, IL7, CD8A and TLR1. Meanwhile at 6-7\u00a0days post vaccination, 9 genes were significantly up-regulated, including RIPK2, TGFB1, MICB, SOCS1, IL2RA, MS4A1, PTPRC, IL2 and IL8. By days 12-15 the genes RIPK2, IL4, IL12B and TLR2 were overexpressed. RIPK2 was upregulated at all 3\u00a0time points. Our data suggests an overall proliferation, differentiation and regulation of B and T cells in the tonsils following LAIV, where the majority of genes were up-regulated at days 6-7 and normalized by days 12-15. These findings may provide a first step into defining future biomarkers or correlates of protection after LAIV immunization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9343cf058f61000dea9","authors":["Panapasa, Jack A","Cox, Rebecca J","Mohn, Kristin G I","Aqrawi, Lara A","Brokstad, Karl A","Jack A Panapasa","Rebecca J Cox","Kristin G I Mohn","Lara A Aqrawi","Karl A Brokstad"],"doi":"10.1080\/21645515.2015.1032486","first_seen_on":"2015-07-07T10:17:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2164-554X","2164-5515"],"issue":"7","journal":"Human vaccines immunotherapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1436264139,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26148331?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/21645515.2015.1032486"],"pmid":"26148331","pubdate":"2015-07-07T22:00:07+00:00","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The expression of B & T cell activation markers in children's tonsils following live attenuated influenza vaccine.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-b-t-cell-activation-markers-childrens-tonsils-following-live-attenuated-influenza-vaccine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325534,"mean":6.2412730147394,"rank":2827836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1807632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325534,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185954,"mean":8.4813559985589,"rank":102145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":65542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185954,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":816,"mean":2.8805079754601,"rank":313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":816,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":2.7842105263158,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
