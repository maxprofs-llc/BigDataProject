The main themes are the importance of understanding the underlying variation in human metabolism and the use of serum metabolomics in disease profiling.\nSeveral studies have attempted to use serum metabolomics to develop noninvasive biomarkers of disease and\/or track the consequences of nutritional and genetic interventions. Many advances have been made with common changes being identified in ageing, the menopause and cancer but several problems of interpretation have emerged from these studies. These include the small sample sizes in most human studies and the differences between human and rodent metabolomes. However, a metabolic screen of over 1000 'healthy' humans (the Humsermet project) has highlighted many variables that may be used to refine the interpretation and design of previous and future human studies alike, in addition to data mining.\nSome common serum metabolome alterations have been identified but many inconsistencies remain. The construction of a human serum metabolome database should be informative in the design of future human and animal model studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000706a","authors":["James, Emma L","Parkinson, Eric K"],"doi":"10.1097\/mco.0000000000000200","first_seen_on":"2015-07-07T10:45:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-6519","1363-1950"],"issue":"5","journal":"Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care","last_mentioned_on":1440046653,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26147529?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-clinicalnutrition\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/Serum_metabolomics_in_animal_models_and_human.9.aspx"],"pmid":"26147529","pubdate":"2015-07-07T22:01:06+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Serum metabolomics in animal models and human disease","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-metabolomics-animal-models-human-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5565912,"mean":6.3304610756451,"rank":2544431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2882689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5565912,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190708,"mean":8.4613066326879,"rank":86713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":97329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190708,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":759,"mean":5.5917810026385,"rank":343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":759,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.5195652173913,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
