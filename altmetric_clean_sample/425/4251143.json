HTI occurred at an earlier age (median 2 years, range 1-18, vs. median 11 years, range 2-61, p=0.016). Both HTI (22%) and LTI (43%) occurred in non-severe patients. All HTI, but only 64% of LTI, were found to be FVIII-specific by chromogenic Bethesda assay or fluorescence immunoassay (FLI), indicating a high rate of false-positive LTI. Repeat specimens confirmed all HTI, 7\/9 LTI, and 7\/7 FVIII-specific LTI. FLI results were similar between HTI and FVIII-specific LTI; all included IgG1 and IgG4 subclasses. A comparable prospective study conducted from 1975-9 at 13 U.S. centers found 31 (2.3%) new inhibitors among 1360 patients. In both studies, one-third of inhibitors occurred in non-severe patients and one-quarter after 150 exposure days (ED). Significant differences were seen in the age at which inhibitors occurred (median 16 years in the older study vs. 5 years in the current study, p=0.024) and in ED prior to inhibitor development, 10% in the older study and 43% in the current study occurring within 0-20 ED.\nProspective screening detects Inhibitors in patients of all severities, ages, and ED. Some LTI, however, are false positives. This article is protected by copyright.
