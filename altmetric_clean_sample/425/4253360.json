The quotes and qualitative data summaries provide rich insights into understanding why those with type 1 diabetes are at increased risk for eating disorders. Content analyses revealed five themes pertinent to the dual diagnosis (feeling different, difficulty with control\/coping, body image, feelings, and quality of life) of which four themes were relevant to eating disorder development. Findings support early identification of those at risk and inform interventions to mitigate development of an eating disorder.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd2","authors":["Powers, Margaret A","Richter, Sara A","Ackard, Diann M","Cronemeyer, Catherine","Margaret A Powers","Sara A Richter","Diann M Ackard","Catherine Cronemeyer"],"doi":"10.1177\/1359105315589799","endpage":"2976","first_seen_on":"2015-07-08T00:11:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1461-7277","1359-1053"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1480402350,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26124085","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/26\/1359105315589799.long","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/26\/1359105315589799.abstract?utm_content=buffer55056&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/21\/12\/2966.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/26\/1359105315589799.full.pdf","pmid":"26124085","pubdate":"2015-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"2966","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Eating disorders in persons with type 1 diabetes: A focus group investigation of early eating disorder risk","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/eating-disorders-persons-type-1-diabetes-focus-group-investigation-early-eating-disorder-risk-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7822782,"mean":6.6331385505942,"rank":1895139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":5909178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7822782,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225496,"mean":8.1257980088251,"rank":65926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":158619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225496,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1266,"mean":6.646343083004,"rank":341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1266,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":5.4196333333333,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Psychology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"FR":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aedweb\/status\/618572796935958528","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4253360],"posted_on":"2015-07-08T00:10:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Academy for E.D.","url":"http:\/\/www.aedweb.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/461973850624778240\/8nmMhLTK_normal.jpeg","description":"The Academy for Eating Disorders: A global, professional association committed to leadership in eating disorders research, education, treatment and prevention.","id_on_source":"aedweb","tweeter_id":"21700435","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10280},"tweet_id":"618572796935958528"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ADHD123SUE\/status\/618735294414737408","license":"datasift","rt":["aedweb"],"citation_ids":[4253360],"posted_on":"2015-07-08T10:56:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Sue","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/460055248154148864\/Id9x5fVj_normal.jpeg","description":"\u2665Knowledge is power!\u2665Children are the future!\u2665","id_on_source":"ADHD123SUE","tweeter_id":"436727518","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2034},"tweet_id":"618735294414737408"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nsedrecovery\/status\/618733559596085248","license":"datasift","rt":["aedweb"],"citation_ids":[4253360],"posted_on":"2015-07-08T10:49:10+00:00","author":{"name":"EatingDisordersNS","url":"http:\/\/eatingdisordersns.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/702582717339144192\/978p_Ko3_normal.jpg","description":"Information.
