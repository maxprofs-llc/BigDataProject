Screening for human leukocyte antigen risk genotypes in neonates with follow-up detection of islet autoantibodies in childhood has been explored. An alternative approach of general childhood population-based detection of autoantibodies at well child visits provides an approach to detect a high proportion of children who will develop T1D. The Fr1da study was launched in Bavaria in 2015 to explore this concept.\nGeneral childhood population-based screening for risk of T1D will allow detection of an at-risk population that can participate in natural history studies to better understand disease pathogenesis and intervention trials to prevent symptomatic disease and will provide a framework for public health-based prevention of childhood-onset T1D.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000706e","authors":["Insel, Richard A","Dunne, Jessica L","Ziegler, Anette-G"],"doi":"10.1097\/med.0000000000000173","first_seen_on":"2015-07-07T16:41:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1752-2978"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1436287234,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26087338"],"pmid":"26087338","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"General population screening for type 1 diabetes: has its time come?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/general-population-screening-type-1-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325534,"mean":6.2412730147394,"rank":3749327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":891487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325534,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185955,"mean":8.4813149596139,"rank":129429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185955,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":596,"mean":2.2360403361345,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":596,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.4,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CureT1Diabetes\/status\/618459603647361024","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4252340],"posted_on":"2015-07-07T16:40:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Ellen H Ullman \u24cb","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000130536147\/ebe89f6b18fefe800b0cb3e0baacf02c_normal.jpeg","description":"MSW;Geriatric Case Manager;Humanitarian; Vegan;GF; dedicated to a cure for type 1 diabetes;views are my own; QUINTESSENTIALLY RESOURCEFUL","id_on_source":"CureT1Diabetes","tweeter_id":"17386718","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":7410},"tweet_id":"618459603647361024"}]}}
