Starting from our discovered 4-amino-1,3,5-triazine inhibitors of htII\u03b1, we investigated a library of 2,4,6-trisubstituted-1,3,5-triazines for novel inhibitors that bind to the htII\u03b1 ATP binding site using a combination of structure-based and ligand-based pharmacophore models and molecular docking. 4,6-substituted-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-ones 8, 9 and 14 were identified as novel inhibitors with activity comparable to the established drug etoposide (1). Compound 8 inhibits the htII\u03b1 decatenation in a superior fashion to etoposide. Cleavage assays demonstrated that selected compounds 8 and 14 do not act as poisons and antagonize the poison effect of etoposide. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) confirmed binding of compound 8 to the htII\u03b1 ATPase domain and compound 14 effectively inhibits the htII\u03b1 mediated ATP hydrolysis. The molecular dynamics simulation study provides further insight into the molecular recognition. The 4,6-disubstituted-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-ones represent the first validated monocyclic class of catalytic inhibitors that bind to the to the htII\u03b1 ATPase domain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f1","authors":["Pogorel\u010dnik, Barbara","Jane\u017ei\u010d, Matej","Sosi\u010d, Izidor","Gobec, Stanislav","Solmajer, Tom","Perdih, Andrej"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmc.2015.06.049","first_seen_on":"2015-07-07T16:11:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09680896","1464-3391"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1436285504,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S096808961500543X"],"pmid":"26183545","pubdate":"2015-07-18T22:01:42+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"4,6- substituted-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-ones as monocyclic catalytic inhibitors of human DNA topoisomerase II\u03b1 targeting the ATP binding site ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/46substituted135triazin21hones-monocyclic-catalytic-inhibitors-human-dna-topoisomerase-ii%CE%B1-targeting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5325307,"mean":6.2415772840095,"rank":3749232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":891433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5325307,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185949,"mean":8.4824213758687,"rank":129432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185949,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1064,"mean":2.1445211665099,"rank":630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1064,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":1.4078947368421,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
