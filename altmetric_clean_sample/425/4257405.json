One-dimensional coordination complex chains extending parallel to c are generated in which the triply \u03bc2-O-bridged Ca(2+) cations are separated by 3.6401\u2005(5)\u2005\u00c5. In the crystal, weak intra-chain C-H\u22ef\u03c0 hydrogen bonds are present between the methyl H atoms of the dimethyl sulfoxide mol-ecules as donors and the aromatic rings as acceptors [C-H\u22efCg = 3.790\u2005(4)\u2005\u00c5].","authors":["Voronova, A.S."],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989015012487","first_seen_on":"2015-07-09T00:01:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"Pt 8","journal":"Acta crystallographica.
