Chromofungin (Chr: CgA47-66) is one of these peptides that display antimicrobial activities and activate neutrophils, with important implications in inflammation and innate immunity. The aim of the present study is to examine the effects of Chr on isolated and Langendorff perfused rat hearts. The study was performed by using the isolated and Langendorff perfused rat hearts, Elisa assay and real-time PCR. We found that, under basal conditions, increasing doses (11-165nM) of Chr induced negative inotropic effects without changing coronary pressure. This action was mediated by the AKT\/eNOS\/cGMP\/PKG pathway. We also found that Chr acted as a postconditioning (PostC) agent against ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) damages, reducing infarct size and LDH level. Cardioprotection involved PI3K, RISK pathway, MitoKATP and miRNA-21. We suggest that Chr directly affects heart performance, protects against I\/R myocardial injuries through the activation of prosurvival kinases. Results may propose Chr as a new physiological neuroendocrine modulator able to prevent heart dysfunctions, also encouraging the clarification of its clinical potential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032be","authors":["Filice, Elisabetta","Pasqua, Teresa","Quintieri, Anna Maria","Cantafio, Patrizia","Scavello, Francesco","Amodio, Nicola","Cerra, Maria Carmela","Marban, C\u00e9line","Schneider, Francis","Metz-Boutigue, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","Angelone, Tommaso"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.peptides.2015.06.013","first_seen_on":"2015-07-08T16:52:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5169"],"journal":"Peptides","last_mentioned_on":1466250788,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26151429?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26151429","pubdate":"2015-07-08T22:00:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Chromofungin, CgA47-66-derived peptide, produces basal cardiac effects and postconditioning cardioprotective action during ischemia\/reperfusion injury.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chromofungin-cga4766derived-peptide-produces-basal-cardiac-effects-postconditioning-cardioprotective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7912542,"mean":6.6949158185663,"rank":1909621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":5986454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7912542,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225889,"mean":8.1505969329934,"rank":65471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":159724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225889,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":710,"mean":2.5019717912553,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":710,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.2527777777778,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":3,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/status\/618824912820502528","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4256401],"posted_on":"2015-07-08T16:52:11+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
