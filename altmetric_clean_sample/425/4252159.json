Gingival epithelium (GE) controls were taken from ten reactive gingival fibro-epithelial hyperplasia.\nA mean positivity of 80% for both CK 1\/10 and CK 4 was noted in the GE and of 5% for both CK 8\/18 and CK 19. LJSGH lesions presented a mean positivity of 65% for CK 19, 60% for CK 8\/18, 30% for CK4 and 5% for CK 1\/10. The differences between LJSGH and GE were statistically significant (p<0.01).\nThe LJSGH CK pattern of expression is reminiscent of the profile described in the literature for junctional epithelium (JE). Possibly, JE exteriorized from the gingival sulcus would be more prone to irritation from perhaps a variety of sources, resulting in inflammation and ultimately hyperplasia, subsequently developing LJSGH.
