To shorten the preparation of [(18)F]AV-133 and to make it more widely available, a simple and rapid purification method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) instead of high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed. The SPE method produced doses containing the non-radioactive pseudo-carrier 9-hydroxypropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine (AV-149). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the brain uptake of AV-149 by UPLC-MS\/MS and its effect on the biodistribution of [(18)F]AV-133 in the brains of mice.\nThe mice were injected with a bolus including [(18)F]AV-133 and different doses of AV-149. Brain tissue and blood samples were harvested. The effect of different amounts of AV-149 on [(18)F]AV-133 was evaluated by quantifying the brain distribution of radiolabelled tracer [(18)F]AV-133. The concentrations of AV-149 in the brain and plasma were analyzed using a UPLC-MS\/MS method.\nThe concentrations of AV-149 in the brain and plasma exhibited a good linear relationship with the doses. The receptor occupancy curve was fit, and the calculated ED50 value was 8.165mg\/kg. The brain biodistribution and regional selectivity of [(18)F]AV-133 had no obvious differences at AV-149 doses lower than 0.1mg\/kg. With increasing doses of AV-149, the brain biodistribution of [(18)F]AV-133 changed significantly.\nThe results are important to further support that the improved radiolabelling procedure of [(18)F]AV-133 using an SPE method may be suitable for routine clinical application.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f6100031fb","authors":["Wu, Xianying","Zhou, Xue","Zhang, Shuxian","Zhang, Yan","Deng, Aifang","Han, Jie","Zhu, Lin","Kung, Hank F","Qiao, Jinping"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nucmedbio.2015.03.009","first_seen_on":"2015-07-08T16:43:38+00:00","issns":["1872-9614","0969-8051"],"journal":"Nuclear Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1436373736,"links":["http:\/\/www.nucmedbio.com\/article\/S0969-8051%2815%2900061-X\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nucmedbio.com\/article\/S096980511500061X\/pdf","pmid":"25910857","pubdate":"2015-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Brain uptake of a non-radioactive pseudo-carrier and its effect on the biodistribution of [18\u2005F]AV-133 in mouse brain","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brain-uptake-nonradioactive-pseudocarrier-effect-biodis-tribution-18-fav133-mouse-brain-brain-uptake"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5328866,"mean":6.2435257016281,"rank":4436892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5328866,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185868,"mean":8.4820687696042,"rank":149652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185868,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240,"mean":1.4970962343096,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.4944444444444,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
