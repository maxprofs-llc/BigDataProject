In tumour microenvironments, their presence is related to a poor prognosis, and they influence the therapeutic outcome due to their capacity to suppress the immune response by cell-cell contact and to release immunosuppressive cytokines. In this study, we demonstrate that Treg immunosuppressive activity can be modulated by the cross-linking between the CD45RA expressed by Tregs and the C-type lectin MGL. This specific interaction strongly decreases the im-munosuppressive activity of Tregs, restoring the proliferative capacity of co-cultured T lymphocytes. This effect can be attributed to changes in CD45RA and TCR signalling through the inhibition of Lck and inactivation of Zap-70, an increase in the Foxp3 methylation status and, ultimately, the reduced production of suppressive cytokines. These results indicate a role of MGL as an immunomodulator within the tumour microenvironment interfering with Treg functions, suggesting its possible use in the design of anticancer vaccines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Zizzari, Ilaria Grazia","Martufi, Paola","Battisti, Federico","Rahimi, Hassan","Caponnetto, Salvatore","Bellati, Filippo","Nuti, Marianna","Rughetti, Aurelia","Napoletano, Chiara"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0132617","first_seen_on":"2015-07-07T10:15:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1460462771,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26147970?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26147970","pubdate":"2015-07-07T22:00:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Macrophage Galactose-Type C-Type Lectin (MGL) Modulates Regulatory T Cell Functions.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/macrophage-galactosetype-ctype-lectin-mgl-modulates-regulatory-t-cell-functions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":5707961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1009060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224360,"mean":8.0607517505428,"rank":155239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":37483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224360,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107514,"mean":10.1995360189,"rank":78473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":16721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107514,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6408,"mean":9.340939909474,"rank":4766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6408,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
