We investigated the efficacy of sunitinib, a multikinase VEGF inhibitor, in patients with relapsed\/refractory GE\/oesophageal cancer.\nThis was a single-stage Fleming phase II study. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 24 weeks. If five or more patients out of a total of 25 were free of progressive disease at 24 weeks, sunitinib would be recommended for further study. Patients received sunitinib 37.5\u2009mg orally daily and imaged every 6 weeks. Exploratory correlative analysis included serum growth factors, tumour gene expression and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI).\nTwenty-five evaluable patients participated in the study. Progression-free survival at 24 weeks was 8% (n=2 patients; confidence interval (CI): 95% 1.4-22.5%), and the duration of best response for the patients was 23 and 72 weeks. Ten patients (42%) had stable disease (SD) for >10 weeks. Overall response rate is 13%. Median PFS is 7 weeks (95% CI: 5.6-11.4 weeks) and the median overall survival is 17 weeks (95% CI: 8.9-25.3 weeks). Most common grade 3\/4 toxicities included fatigue (24%), anaemia (20%) thrombocytopenia (16%), and leucopenia (16%). No patients discontinued therapy due to toxicity. Serum VEGF-A and -C levels, tumour complement factor B (CFB) gene expression, and DCE-MRI correlated with clinical benefit, defined as SD or better as best response.\nSunitinib is well tolerated but only a select subgroup of patients benefited. Serum VEGF-A and -C may be early predictors of benefit. On this study, patients with clinical benefit from sunitinib had higher tumour CFB expression, and thus has identified CFB as a potential predictor for efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy. These findings need validation from future prospective trials.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 7 July 2015; doi:10.1038\/bjc.2015.197 www.bjcancer.com.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243d","authors":["C Wu","C Wu","S Mikhail","L Wei","C Timmers","S Tahiri","A Neal","J Walker","S El-Dika","M Blazer","J Rock","D J Clark","X Yang","J L Chen","J Liu","M V Knopp","T Bekaii-Saab"],"doi":"10.1038\/bjc.2015.197","first_seen_on":"2015-07-08T19:11:16+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1532-1827","0007-0920"],"journal":"British Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1446163324,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/bjc\/rss\/aop\/~3\/1S_x5FVGc4M\/bjc.2015.197","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bjc\/journal\/v113\/n2\/full\/bjc2015197a.html"],"pmid":"26151457","pubdate":"2015-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"A phase II and pharmacodynamic study of sunitinib in relapsed|[sol]|refractory oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal cancers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phase-ii-pharmacodynamic-study-sunitinib-relapsedrefractory-oesophageal-gastrooesophageal-cancers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6507444,"mean":6.0294063692903,"rank":641342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":5857484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6507444,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194948,"mean":8.562442992198,"rank":29972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":164449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194948,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3051,"mean":8.8527704918033,"rank":693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3051,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":11.96414159292,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
