The barium swallow study detected a fistula in four cases. Endoscopy identified an internal opening at the pyriform sinus in all cases with four on the left side and one on the right side. All patients underwent KTP laser assisted endoscopic tissue fibrin glue biocauterization as treatment for CPSF. Only one case required the second endoscopic procedure due to fluctuation of symptoms. Post-endoscopic follow-up duration of these patients was 24.6\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6 (7-36) months. Neither complications nor recurrences were noted during follow-up in all patients.\nFor children presenting with repeated acute suppurative thyroiditis or neck infections, clinicians should highly suspect the possibility of CPSF. Endoscopy should be performed not only to confirm the diagnosis but also could be served as an initial treatment modality of biocauterization by KTP laser and tissue fibrin glue, which was demonstrated as a less invasive, safe, and effective method in children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b88","authors":["Yun-Chen Huang","Steve Shinn-Forng Peng","Wei-Chung Hsu","Huang,
