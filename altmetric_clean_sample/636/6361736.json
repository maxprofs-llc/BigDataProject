Objectives The main aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of corticosteroids better associated than paralleled with neuromuscular training (C\u2009+\u2009FNT) is more effective than facial neuromuscular training (FNT) applied alone, in terms of recovery degree and facial symmetry during the early phase of Bell's palsy (BP). Patients and methods A prospective single-blinded study involved 73 patients: the C\u2009+\u2009FNT group (n\u2009=\u200942; median age = 37.5 years) and FNT group (n\u2009=\u200931; median age = 49.0 years). Patients were assessed before and 6 weeks after treatment by House-Brackmann (HB-FGS) and Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (SB-FGS). Results Recovery degree and facial symmetry improved significantly in both groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001), without differences between groups (p\u2009>\u20090.05). However, the C\u2009+\u2009FNT group displayed better outcomes for cheek (p\u2009=\u20090.004) and mouth (p\u2009=\u20090.022) resting symmetry at SB-FGS, instead of compared to the FNT group. The corticosteroids had no significant effect on all recovery degrees (p\u2009=\u20090.992) and rapid remission (p\u2009=\u20090.952). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the type of intervention was not a significant predictor for recovery degree (p\u2009=\u20090.917).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5173cf058f610003806","authors":["Ferreira, Margarida","Firmino, Machado J","Marques, Elisa A","Santos, Paula C","Duarte, Jos\u00e9 A","Margarida Ferreira"],"doi":"10.3109\/00016489.2016.1154604","endpage":"6","first_seen_on":"2016-03-28T15:00:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1651-2251","0001-6489"],"journal":"Acta Oto-Laryngologica","last_mentioned_on":1459174676,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3109\/00016489.2016.1154604","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/00016489.2016.1154604"],"pmid":"27003272","pubdate":"2016-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Are corticosteroids useful in all degrees of severity and rapid recovery of Bell\u2019s palsy?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/corticosteroids-useful-degrees-severity-rapid-recovery-bells-palsy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7452554,"mean":6.4746174952351,"rank":6455382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7452554,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275414,"mean":10.985823203697,"rank":232913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275414,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":837,"mean":2.1676076555024,"rank":777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":837,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.7277777777778,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
