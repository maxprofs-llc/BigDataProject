We performed a randomized double-blind multicenter trial to evaluate its efficacy and safety compared with the innovator medication Neoral for preventing acute rejection episodes in adult patients during the first year after renal transplant.\nWe used 221 de novo renal transplant recipients from 6 transplant centers in Iran enrolled between April 2008, and January 2010. They were randomized to receive either Iminoral or Neoral as the calcineurin inhibitor component of the immunosuppressive regimen in addition to mycophenolate mofetil and oral corticosteroids. They were followed-up for 1 year. The primary endpoint was the rate of acute allograft rejection. Secondary endpoints consisted of 1-year graft survival rates, daily dosages of cyclosporine, trough and C2 cyclosporine blood level, serum creatinine levels, patient death rates, discontinuing the study drug, tolerability, and adverse events.\nThe risk of acute rejection episode during the first month after transplant was 9% for Iminoral and 10% for Neoral; these declined to 4% and 2% during next 11 months. One-year graft survival rate was 0.86 for both groups. Renal function stabilized during the first month. Declination of the creatinine levels was similar between the 2 groups and reached a stable value of 114.9 \u03bcmol\/L five months after the transplant. The frequency of clinical complications was similar between the groups.\nIminoral is safe and effective when used in de novo kidney transplant patients as an immunosuppressive medication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9353cf058f61000dec6","authors":["Khatami, Seyyed Mohammad Reza","Taheri, Shahram","Azmandian, Jalal","Sagheb, Mohammad Mahdi","Nazemian, Fatemeh","Razeghi, Effat","Shahidi, Sharzad","Sadri, Farzaneh","Shamshiri, Ahmad Reza","Sayyah, Mohammad"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-28T13:56:35+00:00","issns":["2146-8427"],"issue":"3","journal":"Experimental and clinical transplantation official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1459173379,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26086833?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"26086833","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"One-Year Multicenter Double-Blind Randomized Clinical Trial on the Efficacy and Safety of Generic Cyclosporine (Iminoral) in De Novo Kidney Transplant Recipients.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oneyear-multicenter-doubleblind-randomized-clinical-trial-efficacy-safety-generic-cyclosporine-imino-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7452554,"mean":6.4746174952351,"rank":5377861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1812801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7452554,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275415,"mean":10.985784223024,"rank":178017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":81891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275415,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199,"mean":0.73378787878788,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.60714285714286,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
