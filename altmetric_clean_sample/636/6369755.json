We aimed to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of endoscopic injection of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) for preventing esophageal strictures after ESD for superficial esophageal squamous carcinoma.\nSixty-seven superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinomas patients with a mucosal defects that exceeded one-half of the circumference of the esophagus after ESD treatment, were enrolled and randomly divided into 2 groups (group A, n=33; group B, n=34). Patients in group A (BTX-A group) were immediately injected of BTX-A after ESD, whereas patients in group B (control group) received ESD only. Endoscopy was performed when patients reported dysphagia symptoms and at 12 weeks post-ESD in patients without symptoms. Patients experienced post-ESD esophageal stricture in both groups received bougie dilation.\nThe number of patients who experienced esophageal stricture in group A (PP analysis, 6.1%, 2\/33; ITT analysis, 11.4%, 4\/35) was significantly less than that seen in group B (PP analysis, 32.4%, 11\/34; ITT analysis, 37.8%, 14\/37) (P < 0.05). Moreover, the number of bougie dilation procedures was significantly lower in group A (mean, 1.5; range, 0-2) than in group B (mean, 2.8; range, 0-5) (P<0.05).\nEndoscopic injection of BTX-A was effective in preventing post-ESD esophageal stricture and decreasing the times of bougie dilation procedures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058f7","authors":["Jing Wen","Zhongsheng Lu","Enqiang Linghu","Yunsheng Yang","Jing Yang","Shufang Wang","Bin Yan","Jie Song","Xiaodong Zhou","Xiangdong Wang","Ke Meng","Yan Dou","Qingsen Liu","Wen, Jing","Lu, Zhongsheng","Linghu, Enqiang","Yang, Yunsheng","Yang, Jing","Wang, Shufang","Yan, Bin","Song, Jie","Zhou, Xiaodong","Wang, Xiangdong","Meng, Ke","Dou, Yan","Liu, Qingsen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gie.2016.03.1484","endpage":"613","first_seen_on":"2016-03-29T06:52:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1097-6779","00165107"],"issue":"4","journal":"Gastrointestinal Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1477424706,"links":["http:\/\/www.giejournal.org\/article\/S0016-5107(16)01778-8\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.giejournal.org\/article\/S0016-5107(16)01778-8\/fulltext?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.giejournal.org\/article\/S0016510716017788\/pdf","pmid":"27032884","pubdate":"2016-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"606","subjects":["diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Prevention of esophageal strictures after endoscopic submucosal dissection with the injection of botulinum toxin type A","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevention-esophageal-strictures-after-endoscopic-submucosal-dissection-injection-botulinum-toxin-ty-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":2.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":3024370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4559883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276355,"mean":11.032043726524,"rank":102474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":173494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276355,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2177,"mean":3.1103106617647,"rank":796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2177,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":2.8933211009174,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
