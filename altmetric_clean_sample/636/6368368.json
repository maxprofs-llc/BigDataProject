In this study, we examined how these contradictory activities of Nrf2 - cancer chemoprevention and cancer cell growth enhancement - can be reconciled in an established mouse model of urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis. Using Keap1-knockdown (kd) mice which express high levels of Nrf2, we found that urethane was rapidly excreted into the urine, consistent with an upregulation in the expression of urethane detoxification genes. Consequently, urethane-induced tumors were significantly smaller and less frequent in Keap1-kd mice than in wild-type mice. In contrast, tumor cells derived from Keap1-kd mice and transplanted into nude mice exhibited higher tumorigenicity compared with cells derived from wild-type mice. To identify the factors contributing to the tumor growth phenotype in the transplantation model, we performed a microarray analysis and found that many antioxidative stress genes were upregulated in the Keap1-kd-derived tumors. Therefore, we suggest that Nrf2 activation in cancer cells enhances their tumorigenicity, but global Nrf2 activation, as in Keap1-kd mice, simultaneously enhances anticancer immunity, thereby suppressing the growth potential of Keap1-kd tumors. Our findings provide relevant insight into the dual role of Nrf2 in cancer and warrant further studies of Nrf2 function during different stages of carcinogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Hironori Satoh","Takashi Moriguchi","Daisuke Saigusa","Liam Baird","Lei Yu","Hirofumi Rokutan","Keiko Igarashi","Masahito Ebina","Tatsuhiro Shibata","Masayuki Yamamoto","Satoh, Hironori","Moriguchi, Takashi","Saigusa, Daisuke","Baird, Liam","Yu, Lei","Rokutan, Hirofumi","Igarashi, Keiko","Ebina, Masahito","Shibata, Tatsuhiro","Yamamoto, Masayuki"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-15-1584","first_seen_on":"2016-03-29T03:55:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1538-7445","0008-5472"],"issue":"10","journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1464373020,"links":["http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/26\/0008-5472.CAN-15-1584.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27020858?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/76\/10\/3088.short?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-15-1584","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/76\/10\/3088.short?rss=1&7KU9","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/76\/10\/3088.short?rss=1&PgwP","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/76\/10\/3088.short?rss=1&5M97w","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/76\/10\/3088.short?rss=1&Cl1sP","http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/76\/10\/3088.short?rss=1&bAm"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/26\/0008-5472.CAN-15-1584.full.pdf","pmid":"27020858","pubdate":"2016-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"NRF2 intensifies host defense systems to prevent lung carcinogenesis, but after tumor initiation accelerates malignant cell growth","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nrf2-intensifies-host-defense-systems-prevent-lung-carcinogenesis-after-tumor-initiation-accelerates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":667345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7151235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277940,"mean":11.067618815639,"rank":35466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":242329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277940,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7159,"mean":6.7155406538139,"rank":588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7159,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235,"mean":7.9183931623932,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
