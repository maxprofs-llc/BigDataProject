Patients were classified into three groups based on grade and stage: stage IA or IB grade 1 (low risk); stage IA or IB grade 2 (intermediate risk); and stage IA or IB grade 3 or any stage IC (high risk). Multivariable models were developed to examine predictors of chemotherapy use and survival.\nWe identified 21,758 patients including 4,196 (19.3%) low-risk, 3,777 (17.4%) intermediate-risk, and 13,785 (63.4%) high-risk women. The median follow-up of the cohort was 63.9 months. Use of chemotherapy within the groups was 15.5%, 39.5%, and 69.8%, respectively (P<.001). Among low-risk patients, chemotherapy was not associated with a change in survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.42), whereas chemotherapy was associated with reduced mortality for high-risk patients (adjusted HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.71-0.85). For intermediate-risk patients (stage IA-IB grade 2), chemotherapy was associated with a 26% reduction in mortality (adjusted HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.89). The association between chemotherapy and improved survival among intermediate-risk patients remained significant when limited to patients who underwent staging lymphadenectomy (adjusted HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.97).\nThere is widespread variation in the patterns of care for early-stage ovarian cancer. Chemotherapy was associated with improved survival for stage IA-IB grade 2 patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003224","authors":["Chatterjee, Sudeshna","Chen, Ling","Tergas, Ana I.","Burke, William M.","Hou, June Y.","Hu, Jim C.","Ananth, Cande V.","Neugut, Alfred I.","Hershman, Dawn L.","Wright, Jason D."],"doi":"10.1097\/aog.0000000000001404","first_seen_on":"2016-05-24T06:41:08+00:00","funders":["nci","niehs"],"issns":["1873-233X","0029-7844"],"issue":"6","journal":"Obstetrics & Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1493614457,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/greenjournal\/Abstract\/2016\/06000\/Utilization_and_Outcomes_of_Chemotherapy_in_Women.3.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/greenjournal\/Abstract\/2016\/06000\/Utilization_and_Outcomes_of_Chemotherapy_in_Women.3.aspx?utm_content=bufferc0c15&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/greenjournal\/Abstract\/2016\/06000\/Utilization_and_Outcomes_of_Chemotherapy_in_Women.3.aspx?utm_content=buffer04de8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/greenjournal\/2016\/06000\/Utilization_and_Outcomes_of_Chemotherapy_in_Women.3.pdf","pmid":"27159756","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"992","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Utilization and Outcomes of Chemotherapy in Women With Intermediate-Risk, Early-Stage Ovarian Cancer","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/greenjournal\/Fulltext\/2016\/06000\/Utilization_and_Outcomes_of_Chemotherapy_in_Women.3.aspx","volume":"127","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/utilization-outcomes-chemotherapy-women-intermediaterisk-earlystage-ovarian-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":2.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":1656265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6493834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271751,"mean":11.577376029438,"rank":69898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":201562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271751,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4768,"mean":10.990537025383,"rank":1653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4768,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":20.27652173913,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Chemistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"ES":1,"VE":1,"GT":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WKWomensHealth\/statuses\/734996322227388416","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8144061],"posted_on":"2016-05-24T06:35:53+00:00","author":{"name":"WK WomensHealth","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/562714651104788480\/5l0_gER9_normal.jpeg","description":"Updates from Wolters Kluwer's Women's Health journals and other OB\/GYN news.
