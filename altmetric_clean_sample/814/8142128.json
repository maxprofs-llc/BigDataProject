Conventional echocardiography of both the left ventricles (LV) and right ventricles (RV) was undertaken. An assessment of simultaneous longitudinal strain and LV volume\/RV area was provided. Data was presented as derived strain for % end diastolic volume\/area. Athletes in group IC and IIIC had larger LV end diastolic volumes compared to athletes in groups IA and IIIA (50\u2009\u00b1\u20096 and 54\u2009\u00b1\u20098\u00a0ml\/(m(2))(1.5) versus 42\u2009\u00b1\u20097 and 43\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0ml\/(m(2))(1.5) respectively). Group IIIC also had significantly larger mean wall thickness (MWT) compared to all groups. Athletes from group IIIC required greater longitudinal strain for any given % volume which correlated to MWT (r\u2009=\u20090.4, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Findings were similar in the RV with the exception that group IIIC athletes required lower strain for any given % area. There are physiological differences between athletes with the largest LV and RV in athletes from group IIIC. These athletes also have greater resting longitudinal contribution to volume change in the LV which, in part, is related to an increased wall thickness. A lower longitudinal contribution to area change in the RV is also apparent in these athletes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007843","authors":["Oxborough, David","Heemels, Annemieke","Somauroo, John","McClean, Gavin","Mistry, Punit","Lord, Rachel","Utomi, Victor","Jones, Nigel","Thijssen, Dick","Sharma, Sanjay","Osborne, Rebecca","Sculthorpe, Nicholas","George, Keith","David Oxborough","Annemieke Heemels","John Somauroo","Gavin McClean","Punit Mistry","Rachel Lord","Victor Utomi","Nigel Jones","Dick Thijssen","Sanjay Sharma","Rebecca Osborne","Nicholas Sculthorpe","Keith George"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10554-016-0910-4","first_seen_on":"2016-05-24T03:56:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-8312","1569-5794","1573-0743"],"journal":"The International Journal of Cardiovascular Imaging (formerly Cardiac Imaging)","last_mentioned_on":1465573566,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27209282?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10554-016-0910-4"],"pmid":"27209282","pubdate":"2016-05-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Left and right ventricular longitudinal strain-volume\/area relationships in elite athletes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/left-right-ventricular-longitudinal-strainvolumearea-relationships-elite-athletes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":858185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7019529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269695,"mean":11.446070932241,"rank":44085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":225510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269695,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":890,"mean":1.0908076490439,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":890,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.1636363636364,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
