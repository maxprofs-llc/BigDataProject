The activation of inflammasome can cause a series of inflammatory responses including maturation of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and a specialized form of cell death called pyroptosis. Since its identification in the early 2000s, inflammasomes have been implicated to play multifaceted roles in varied pathological and physiological conditions, especially in the mucosal compartments including the gut. Maintaining gut mucosal homeostasis has always been a remarkable challenge for the host due to both the vast mucosal surface that is exposed to the outside and the enormous amount of local microbiota. To accomplish this challenge, the host mounts a constant dynamic low-grade inflammatory response (physiological inflammation) in coping with insults of microbes in the intestine. This book chapter aims to summarize the current knowledge of how inflammasomes contribute to gut mucosal homeostasis.","aggregated_in":[26299658],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd24","authors":["Xiaomin Yao","Guangxun Meng"],"book":{"title":"Regulation of Inflammatory Signaling in Health and Disease","isbns":["9789811059865","9789811059872"],"uri":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/book\/10.1007%2F978-981-10-5987-2"},"doi":"10.1007\/978-981-10-5987-2_6","first_seen_on":"2017-09-19T08:31:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0065-2598"],"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","last_mentioned_on":1505816885,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-981-10-5987-2_6","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007%2F978-981-10-5987-2_6","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28921468?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"ordinal_number":6,"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F978-981-10-5987-2_6.pdf","pmid":"28921468","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer, Singapore","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Inflammasomes in the Gut Mucosal Homeostasis","type":"chapter","uri":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-981-10-5987-2_6","volume":"1024"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":1.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":4007713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4241520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111865,"mean":11.790350085819,"rank":49365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":59069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111865,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2535,"mean":3.4187663772691,"rank":908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2535,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Microbiome_Art\/statuses\/910059190239993857","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26299663,26299658],"posted_on":"2017-09-19T08:33:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Articles","url":"https:\/\/maximeborry.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/778305348469919744\/Kq4NuIyd_normal.jpg","description":"A bot retrieving and twitting all the latest Microbiome articles from PubMed.\nMade by @notmaxib","id_on_source":"Microbiome_Art","tweeter_id":"778208387754582018","geo":{"lt":48.84598,"ln":2.20289,"country":"FR"},"followers":404},"tweet_id":"910059190239993857"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HostMicroPapers\/statuses\/910082563871457280","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26299663,26299658],"posted_on":"2017-09-19T10:06:06+00:00","author":{"name":"HKAHostMicroPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/727224114998448128\/cO-ng_II_normal.jpg","description":"Tweets of new microbiome papers as they appear on pubmed. @HollyKArnold","id_on_source":"HostMicroPapers","tweeter_id":"726591212560355328","geo":{"lt":44.56457,"ln":-123.26204,"country":"US"},"followers":24},"tweet_id":"910082563871457280"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Symbiosispapers\/statuses\/910088097148182528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26299663,26299658],"posted_on":"2017-09-19T10:28:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Symbiosis papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471619200876687360\/8YeaykyW_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed of new symbiosis- and microbiome-related papers in PubMed.
