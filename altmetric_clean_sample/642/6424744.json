Identification of the isolated microorganisms was carried out by automatic bacteriologic analyzer VITEK2 Compact30 (BioMerieuX, France) and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis method on AutofleXIII (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) mass-spectrometer.\nComparative identification of 2005 isolates of microorganisms was carried out. Sequencing of ribosomal RNA was used as a reference method. Authenticity of species identification my MALDI-TOF-MS analysis method was: for staphylococci (95.8%), enterococci (97.5%), enterobacteria (98.4%), nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria (93.6%), \u03b2-hemolytiC staphylococci (93.8%), lactobacilli (92.8%), yeast fungi (99.9%).\nIntroduction of MALDI-TOF-MS analysis technology into practical work of microbiological laboratories exceeds previously used methods of microbiological testing in terms of speed; cost and authenticity of identification of a wide spectrum of microorganisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce1e","authors":["Priputnevich, T V","Melkumyan, A R","Lyubasovskaya, L A","Muravieva, V V","Ilina, E N","Sukhikh, G T"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-01T13:17:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0372-9311"],"issue":"1","journal":"Zhurnal mikrobiologii epidemiologii i immunobiologii","last_mentioned_on":1459516633,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27029117?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27029117","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["epidemiology","microbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"[MASS-SPECTROMETRY IN MICROBIOLOGICAL PRACTICE OF SCIENTIFIC CENTRE OF OBSTETRICS, GYNECOLOGY AND PERINATOLOGY].","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/massspectrometry-microbiological-practice-scientific-centre-obstetrics-gynecology-perinatology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":6473640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272639,"mean":11.124546321496,"rank":230678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272639,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":0.83093220338983,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.7,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/715890765415624704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6424744],"posted_on":"2016-04-01T13:17:13+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
