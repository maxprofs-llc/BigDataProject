As it is clear that ignoring the importance of a good design leads to an unprecedented rate of false discoveries which would poison our results, more and more tools are developed to help researchers designing proteomic experiments. In this review, we apply statistical thinking to go through the entire proteomics workflow for biomarker discovery and validation and relate the considerations that should be made at the level of hypothesis building, technology selection, experimental design and the optimization of the experimental parameters.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d9","authors":["Maes, Evelyne","Kelchtermans, Pieter","Bittremieux, Wout","De Grave, Kurt","Degroeve, Sven","Hooyberghs, Jef","Mertens, Inge","Baggerman, Geert","Ramon, Jan","Laukens, Kris","Martens, Lennart","Valkenborg, Dirk","Evelyne Maes"],"doi":"10.1586\/14789450.2016.1172967","endpage":"511","first_seen_on":"2016-04-01T10:38:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-8387","1478-9450"],"issue":"5","journal":"Expert Review of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1484132832,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27031651?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/14789450.2016.1172967?ai=1lx1s&mi=ianpxd&af=R","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1586\/14789450.2016.1172967"],"pmid":"27031651","pubdate":"2016-04-01T22:00:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"495","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Designing biomedical proteomics experiments: state-of-the-art and future perspectives.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/designing-biomedical-proteomics-experiments-stateoftheart-future-perspectives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":859887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7186550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277238,"mean":11.290650367736,"rank":43671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":232618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277238,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":1.7812462908012,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.3631578947368,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
