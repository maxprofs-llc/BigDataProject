Our purpose is to ascertain the 3-month safety and efficacy in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with intravitreal ziv-aflibercept.\nProspectively, consecutive patients with wet AMD underwent ziv-aflibercept intravitreal injection (1.25\u2005mg\/0.05\u2005mL) from March 2015 to November 2015. Monitoring of best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular inflammation, cataract progression and by spectral domain optical coherence tomography were carried out at baseline day 1, 1\u2005week, 1\u2005month, 2\u2005months and 3\u2005months after injections.\n30 eyes were treated (22 Caucasians, 8 Indians; 16 men, 14 women; 14 right eyes and 16 left eyes) with mean age of 74.3\u2005years with 11 treatment-na\u00efve cases and 19 having had treatment-non-na\u00efve. Best-corrected visual acuity improved from baseline logMAR 1.08-0.74 at 1\u2005week, 0.72 at 1\u2005month, 0.67 at 2\u2005months and 0.71 at 3\u2005months (p<0.001 for all time periods). Central macular thickness in microns decreased from 332.8 to 302.0 at 1\u2005week, 244.8 at 1\u2005month, 229.0 at 2\u2005months and 208.2 at 3\u2005months (p<0.001 for all time periods). There were no signs of intraocular inflammation, or change in lens status or increase in intraocular pressure throughout the study.\nOff label use of ziv-aflibercept improves visual acuity, without detectable ocular toxicity and offers a cheaper alternative to the same molecule aflibercept, especially in low\/middle-income countries and in countries where aflibercept (Eylea) is not available.\nNCT02486484.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000244f","authors":["Mansour, Ahmad M","Chhablani, Jay","Antonios, Rafic S","Yogi, Rohit","Younis, Muhammad H","Dakroub, Rola","Chahine, Hasan","Ahmad M Mansour","Jay Chhablani","Rafic S Antonios","Rohit Yogi","Muhammad H Younis","Rola Dakroub","Hasan Chahine"],"doi":"10.1136\/bjophthalmol-2015-308319","endpage":"1633","first_seen_on":"2016-04-01T13:13:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1468-2079","0007-1161"],"issue":"12","journal":"British Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1481175550,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27030277?dopt=Abstract#pubmed","http:\/\/bjo.bmj.com\/content\/100\/12\/1629.short?rss=1","http:\/\/bjobeta.bmj.com\/content\/100\/12\/1629?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjo.bmj.com\/content\/100\/12\/1629.full.pdf","pmid":"27030277","pubdate":"2016-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"bjophthalmol-2015-308319","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Three-month outcome of ziv-aflibercept for exudative age-related macular degeneration","type":"article","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threemonth-outcome-zivaflibercept-exudative-agerelated-macular-degeneration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":2.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7861897,"mean":6.6582651640212,"rank":1930948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4846170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7861897,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275910,"mean":11.178081381905,"rank":88960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":182583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275910,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2440,"mean":4.2993210332103,"rank":465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2440,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":13.87311827957,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"CA":1,"PE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OCTMD\/statuses\/715889629694705665","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6424669],"posted_on":"2016-04-01T13:12:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Brandon Lujan, MD","url":"http:\/\/OCTMD.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459117248297189376\/n_gr2d1r_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical Retina and Imaging Specialist with Expertise in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).","id_on_source":"OCTMD","tweeter_id":"244660420","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":1320},"tweet_id":"715889629694705665"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ruizoft\/statuses\/801068473866715136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6424669],"posted_on":"2016-11-22T14:23:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Clara Ruiz","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558901352613818368\/Wz9MvsD7_normal.jpeg","description":"Oftalm\u00f3loga Marina Baixa (Alicante) y Oftalmar (Alicante-Murcia) - Ophthalmologist - (Spain) http:\/\/es.linkedin.com\/in\/clararuizbelda\/","id_on_source":"ruizoft","tweeter_id":"435965366","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":628},"tweet_id":"801068473866715136"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PeterKarthMD\/statuses\/806642106970292229","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6424669],"posted_on":"2016-12-07T23:30:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Peter Karth, MD, MBA","url":"http:\/\/www.PeterKarthMD.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/762885187789205504\/w2SrDnMA_normal.jpg","description":"Vitreoretinal physician & surgeon.
