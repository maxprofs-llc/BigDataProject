The outcome measures included the incidence and number of multiple PTs, the main risk factors, and their associations with overall survival (OS).Of the 1836 patients, 1400 (76.3%) had a single PT, 344 (18.7%) a second PT, 67 (3.6%) a third PT, and 25 (1.4%) a fourth PT. Univariate analyses (log-rank test) identified the following factors as significantly associated with a fourth PT: simultaneous first and second PTs, betel quid chewing, buccal subsite, and pT3-4 status. After allowance for the potential confounding effect of other risk factors, all of these factors retained their independent prognostic significance in stepwise multivariate analyses, the only exception being betel chewing. The incidences of second, third, and fourth PTs at 5 and 10 years were 20.2%\/34.6%, 4.0%\/8.6%, and 1.0%\/2.3%, respectively. The 5 and 10-year OS rates (calculated from the diagnosis of each PTs) for patients with a single, second, third, and fourth PTs were 68%\/61%, 43%\/37%, 45%\/39%%, and 30%\/30%, respectively (P\u200a<\u200a0.0001). Among patients with a fourth PT, those who underwent radical surgery showed a significantly higher 3-year OS than those who did not (57% vs 13%; P\u200a=\u200a0.0442).Fourth PTs are rarely observed in OSCC patients in a betel quid-chewing endemic area. Long-term survival rates of patients treated with radical surgery seems acceptable, being 4-fold higher than their counterparts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Adel, Mohamad","Liao, Chun-Ta","Lee, Li-Yu","Hsueh, Chuen","Lin, Chien-Yu","Fan, Kang-Hsing","Wang, Hung-Ming","Ng, Shu-Hang","Lin, Chih-Hung","Tsao, Chung-Kan","Huang, Shiang-Fu","Kang, Chung-Jan","Fang, Ku-Hao","Wang, Yu-Chien","Chang, Kai-Ping","Fang, Tuan-Jen","Yang, Lan Yan","Yen, Tzu-Chen"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000002950","first_seen_on":"2016-04-01T16:01:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-5964","0025-7974"],"issue":"12","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1459526504,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2016\/03220\/Incidence_and_Outcomes_of_Patients_With_Oral.7.aspx?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/2016\/03220\/Incidence_and_Outcomes_of_Patients_With_Oral.7.pdf","pmid":"27015170","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e2950","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Incidence and Outcomes of Patients With Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Fourth Primary Tumors","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2016\/03220\/Incidence_and_Outcomes_of_Patients_With_Oral.7.aspx","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incidence-outcomes-patients-oral-cavity-squamous-cell-carcinoma-fourth-primary-tumors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":5393236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1818432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272638,"mean":11.124550812985,"rank":176075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":81005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272638,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3588,"mean":2.9497184276554,"rank":1844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3588,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":512,"mean":3.2400978473581,"rank":271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":512,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MedicineLWW\/statuses\/715932101556604929","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6427004],"posted_on":"2016-04-01T16:01:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Medicine LWW","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/569172208866439168\/f3-9P_th_normal.jpeg","description":"Medicine offers open access publication of original research across a broad spectrum of medical scientific disciplines and sub-specialties.","id_on_source":"MedicineLWW","tweeter_id":"217116133","geo":{"lt":39.29038,"ln":-76.61219,"country":"US"},"followers":169},"tweet_id":"715932101556604929"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Incidence and Outcomes of Patients With Oral Cavity Squamous... : Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1242194722476283&id=170363419659424","license":"public","citation_ids":[6427004],"posted_on":"2016-04-01T16:01:44+00:00","summary":"Current Issue: Incidence and Outcomes of Patients With Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Fourth Primary ... https:\/\/t.co\/JnT7oENEkL","author":{"name":"Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/170363419659424","facebook_wall_name":"Medicine","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/170363419659424\/picture","id_on_source":"170363419659424"}}]}}
