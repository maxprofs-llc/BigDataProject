The possibility that cells use receptor heteromerization to modulate individual receptor pathways is a surmise that cannot be precluded. Given the complexity of these processes, mathematical models contribute to understanding how receptors and their respective ligands regulate signaling. Here, a mathematical model is presented that quantifies the allosteric interactions within a receptor heterodimer. The model is based on the operational model of allosterism including constitutive receptor activity, which provides the pharmacological analysis of heteromerization with well-established and widely used modeling and fitting procedures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002734","authors":["Zhou, Bin","Giraldo, Jes\u00fas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.drudis.2017.07.009","first_seen_on":"2017-08-02T22:09:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1359-6446","13596446","1878-5832"],"journal":"Drug Discovery Today","last_mentioned_on":1501711750,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1359644617301940"],"pmid":"28756203","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Quantifying the allosteric interactions within a G-protein-coupled receptor heterodimer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantifying-allosteric-interactions-within-gproteincoupled-receptor-heterodimer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":6308491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1125511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174902,"mean":11.743829194802,"rank":123438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174902,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":954,"mean":5.2217523609654,"rank":740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":954,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.653125,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/THebertMcGill\/statuses\/892869913051836416","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23377655],"posted_on":"2017-08-02T22:09:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Terry H\u00e9bert","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3692558110\/d2221dcaa41123dc08b3717e79d90d48_normal.jpeg","description":"Scientist;Interested in drug discovery and cellular signalling- opinions my own","id_on_source":"THebertMcGill","tweeter_id":"1447788685","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":776},"tweet_id":"892869913051836416"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Quantifying the allosteric interactions within a G-protein-coupled receptor heterodimer","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1424355620967190&id=638505559552204","license":"public","citation_ids":[23377655],"posted_on":"2017-08-02T22:09:05+00:00","summary":"Understanding how allostery works in GPCR dimers...\n\nhttp:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1359644617301940","author":{"name":"The GPCR Consortium","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/638505559552204","facebook_wall_name":"The GPCR Consortium","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/638505559552204\/picture","id_on_source":"638505559552204"}}]}}
