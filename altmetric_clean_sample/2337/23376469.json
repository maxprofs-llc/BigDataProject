By employing duplex-specific nuclease for signal amplification and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as the carriers of detection probes, a novel electrochemical assay of miRNAs was performed. The method is based on conversion of the well-known colorimetric assay into electrochemical analysis with enhanced sensitivity. DNA capture probes immobilized on the electrode surface and ferrocene (Fc)-labeled DNA detection probes (denoted \"Fc-DNA-Fc\") presented in the solution induced the assembly of positively charged AuNPs on the electrode surface through the electrostatic interaction. As a result, a large number of Fc-DNA-Fc molecules were attached on the electrode surface, thus amplifying the electrochemical signal. When duplex-specific nuclease was added to recycle the process of miRNA-initiated digestion of the immobilized DNA probes, Fc-DNA-Fc-induced assembly of AuNPs on the electrode surface could not occur. This resulted in a significant fall in the oxidation current of Fc. The current was found to be inversely proportional to the concentration of miRNAs in the range of 0-25 fM, and a detection limit of 0.1 fM was achieved. Moreover, this work presents a new method for converting colorimetric assays into sensitive electrochemical analyses, and thus would be valuable for design of novel chemical\/biosensors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["Xia, Ning","Liu, Ke","Zhou, Yingying","Li, Yuanyuan","Yi, Xinyao"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s138656","first_seen_on":"2017-08-02T20:42:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1178-2013"],"journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1501706525,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28761341?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5516875","pmid":"28761341","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Medical Press Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Sensitive detection of microRNAs based on the conversion of colorimetric assay into electrochemical analysis with duplex-specific nuclease-assisted signal amplification","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sensitive-detection-micrornas-based-conversion-colorimetric-assay-electrochemical-analysis-duplexspe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":7188630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174902,"mean":11.743814615125,"rank":143038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174902,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1816,"mean":2.562276584022,"rank":1542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1816,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.3009090909091,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiosensorPapers\/statuses\/892847998329176064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23376469],"posted_on":"2017-08-02T20:42:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Biosensor Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706647650213363712\/BpK5-z3e_normal.jpg","description":"Pubmed Twitterbot for #biosensor papers.
