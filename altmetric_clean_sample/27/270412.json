It is induced frequently by swallowing and yawning. GPN has not been described previously in MS patients. The authors report four MS patients with GPN. Three responded to carbamazepine and one resolved during treatment with adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH) and cyclophosphamide. Withdrawal of carbamazepine after 1 week in one patient resulted in recurrence of pain. GPN may be associated with MS and responds to carbamazepine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Minagar, A","Sheremata, W A"],"first_seen_on":"2011-09-15T14:02:23+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0028-3878"],"issue":"6","journal":"Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1316093477,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10746612"],"pmid":"10746612","pubdate":"2000-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Glossopharyngeal neuralgia and MS.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glossopharyngeal-neuralgia-ms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635015,"mean":4.9193540767705,"rank":2016673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635015,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60924,"mean":4.2518405528289,"rank":24899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":26882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60924,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5948,"mean":7.6165128636287,"rank":3801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5948,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179,"mean":3.0650561797753,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"CO":1,"ZA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/MSTrust\/status\/114330448544546816","citation_ids":[270412],"posted_on":"2011-09-15T13:31:17+00:00","author":{"name":"MSTrust","url":"http:\/\/www.mstrust.org.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1831593844\/MS_RGB_col_250mm_72dpi_normal.jpg","description":"We are here to support people with multiple sclerosis, their friends and families.
