The association between HLA-C and HIV disease outcome was originally determined through a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 35\u2003kb upstream of the HLA-C locus. More recent work has focused on elucidating the functional significance of the -35 SNP, and several groups now have demonstrated HLA-C surface expression to be a key element in control of HIV viral load, with higher surface expression associating with slower disease progression. Most recently, control of HLA-C surface expression has been correlated with the presence of microRNA binding sites that affect HLA-C expression and control of HIV disease. This review highlights these results and explores the ways in which HLA-C surface expression could affect immune system function in the setting of HIV disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a99","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2567.2011.03474.x","first_seen_on":"2011-09-15T14:04:26+00:00","issns":["1365-2567"],"issue":"2","journal":"Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1316101973,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21896007?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21896007","pubdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The emerging role of HLA-C in HIV-1 infection.","type":"article","volume":"134","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emerging-role-hlac-hiv1-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2672563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65821,"mean":5.1722393193558,"rank":30564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":23287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65821,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":661,"mean":3.0431393939394,"rank":383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":661,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":4.1664444444444,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
