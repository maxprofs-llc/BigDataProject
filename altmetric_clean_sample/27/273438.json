From first-principles calculations, we found that a large grain-boundary expansion is caused by a short-range overlap repulsion among densely segregated and neighboring sulfur atoms. This expansion results in a drastic grain-boundary decohesion that reduces the grain-boundary tensile strength by one order of magnitude. This decohesion may directly cause the embrittlement, because the critical sulfur concentration of this decohesion agrees well with experimental data on the embrittlement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2005Sci...307..393Y","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Masatake Yamaguchi","Motoyuki Shiga","Hideo Kaburaki"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1104624","first_seen_on":"2011-09-15T17:13:03+00:00","issns":["1095-9203"],"journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1316096600,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/307\/5708\/393.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/307\/5708\/393.full.pdf","pmid":"15637235","pubdate":"2005-01-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Grain Boundary Decohesion by Impurity Segregation in a Nickel-Sulfur System","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/grain-boundary-decohesion-impurity-segregation-nickelsulfur-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":3556289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":831532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65826,"mean":5.1720673300418,"rank":44614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":9717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65826,"percentile":14},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32016,"mean":27.637690832422,"rank":29467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32016,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":672,"mean":22.594876304024,"rank":564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":672,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
