Several studies have investigated the increased risk of CVD in people living with HIV (PLWH). However, less is known about the exact mechanisms involved in this increased risk. Also, specific guidelines for management of CVD in PLWH have not been developed yet. In this article, we review the recent literature on the mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of CVD in PLWH, with an emphasis on coronary artery disease (CAD).\nAlthough initial studies suspected the increased prevalence of traditional CVD risk factors and side effects of ART to be involved in the increased CVD risk in PLWH, recent studies have uncovered the important role of chronic persistent inflammation in this increased risk. In addition, biomarkers of inflammation have been associated with both CVD events and subclinical CAD in this population. Lastly, recent studies and ongoing clinical trials have been investigating medical interventions that aim to reduce inflammation and cardiovascular events. Different mechanisms of inflammation have been examined in PLWH, including subclinical viremia, microbial translocation, and coinfection with other pathogens such as cytomegalovirus. Although inflammatory biomarkers have been consistently associated with CVD and subclinical CVD outcomes, their prognostic value is unknown. Recent and ongoing trials are exploring the benefits of anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, and antimicrobial translocation drugs on both inflammation and CVD risk among PLWH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007048","authors":["John Charles A.
