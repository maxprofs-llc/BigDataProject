A salient feature of C. albicans biofilms is the presence of the biofilm matrix. This matrix is composed of exopolymeric materials secreted by sessile cells within the biofilm, in which all classes of macromolecules are represented, and provides protection against environmental challenges. In this review, we summarize the knowledge accumulated during the last two decades on the composition, structure, and function of the C. albicans biofilm matrix. Knowledge of the matrix components, its structure, and function will help pave the way to novel strategies to combat C. albicans biofilm infections.","altmetric_jid":"56b368412a83ee42788b45f4","authors":["Christopher Pierce","Taissa Vila","Jesus Romo","Daniel Montelongo-Jauregui","Gina Wall","Anand Ramasubramanian","Jose Lopez-Ribot"],"doi":"10.3390\/jof3010014","first_seen_on":"2017-03-09T02:18:18+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nigms"],"handles":[],"issns":["2309-608X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Fungi","last_mentioned_on":1495189663,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2309-608X\/3\/1\/14\/htm","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/jof3010014","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2309-608X\/3\/1\/14","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28516088?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2309-608X\/3\/1\/14\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC5431293","pmid":"28516088","pubdate":"2017-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"The Candida albicans Biofilm Matrix: Composition, Structure and Function","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/candida-albicans-biofilm-matrix-composition-structure-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":2.75,"6m":2.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":3271849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4930867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237218,"mean":13.789617927888,"rank":90501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":145567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237218,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":2.5268421052632,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.0222222222222,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
