We recruited 1,625 community-based children and 211 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases from 4 sites, and the parents of all participants completed the Chinese version of the ASRS. A robust weighted least squares means and variance adjusted estimator was used for exploratory factor analysis. The 3-factor structure included 59 items suitable for the current sample. The item reliability for the modified Chinese version of the ASRS (MC-ASRS) was excellent. Moreover, with 60 as the cut-off point, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the MC-ASRS had excellent discriminate validity, comparable to that of the unmodified Chinese version (UC-ASRS), with area under the curve values of 0.952 (95% CI: 0.936-0.967) and 0.948 (95% CI: 0.930-0.965), respectively. Meanwhile, the confirm factor analysis revealed that MC-ASRS had a better construct validity than UC-ASRS based on the above factor solution in another children sample. In conclusion, the MC-ASRS shows better efficacy in epidemiological screening for ASD in Chinese children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082b2","authors":["Hao Zhou","Lili Zhang","Xuerong Luo","Lijie Wu","Xiaobing Zou","Kun Xia","Yimin Wang","Xiu Xu","Xiaoling Ge","Yong-Hui Jiang","Eric Fombonne","Weili Yan","Yi Wang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12264-017-0104-7","first_seen_on":"2017-03-09T07:32:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1673-7067","1995-8218"],"journal":"Neuroscience Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1491604144,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28238114?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28238114","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Anatomy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Anesthesiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Modifying the Autism Spectrum Rating Scale (6\u201318\u00a0years) to a Chinese Context: An Exploratory Factor Analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s12264-017-0104-7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modifying-autism-spectrum-rating-scale-618years-chinese-context-exploratory-factor-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":4206355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2233281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231631,"mean":13.570009627423,"rank":132782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":77881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231631,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235,"mean":3.1562905982906,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":4.08375,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
