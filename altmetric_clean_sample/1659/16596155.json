The physicochemical characteristics of the different types of biochar affected the copper retention capacity, by determining the main mechanism involved. The capacity of the biochar to retain copper present in solution depended on the size of the inorganic fraction and varied in the following order: rice biochar>chicken manure biochar>olive mill waste biochar>acacia biochar>eucalyptus biochar>corn cob biochar. The distribution of copper between the forms bound to solid biochar, dissolved organic matter and free organic matter in solution also depended on the starting material. However, the effect of pH on the adsorption capacity was independent of the nature of the starting material, and the copper retention of all types of biochar increased with pH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Diego Ar\u00e1n","Juan Antelo","Sarah Fiol","Felipe Mac\u00edas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2016.04.043","first_seen_on":"2017-02-22T04:16:39+00:00","issns":["09608524"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1461079434,"links":["https:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/a\/1Su-x3QUFYz9YM"],"pmid":"27099945","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Influence of feedstock on the copper removal capacity of waste-derived biochars","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0960852416305302","volume":"212","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-feedstock-copper-removal-capacity-wastederived-biochars"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7571218,"mean":6.5337981331095,"rank":3912313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2120165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7571218,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207561,"mean":13.361722104452,"rank":117575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":70326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207561,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1824,"mean":2.2124904004388,"rank":702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1824,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":3.0221428571429,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
