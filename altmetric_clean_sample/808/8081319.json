Mitochondria control the processing of redox energy that yields adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the oxidation of glucose, pyruvate, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Ultimately, the generation of ROS occurs with the aerobic production of ATP. Although reduced levels of ROS may lead to tolerance against metabolic, mechanical, and oxidative stressors and the generation of brief periods of ROS during ischemia-reperfusion models may limit cellular injury, under most circumstances ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to apoptotic caspase activation and autophagy induction that can result in cellular demise. Yet, new work suggests that ROS generation may have a positive impact through respiratory complex I reverse electron transport that can extend lifespan. Such mechanisms may bring new insight into clinically relevant disorders that are linked to cellular senescence and aging of the body's system. Further investigation of the potential \"bright side\" of ROS and mitochondrial respiration is necessary to target specific pathways, such as the mechanistic target of rapamycin, nicotinamidases, sirtuins, mRNA decoupling and protein expression, and Wnt signaling, that can impact oxidative stress-ROS mechanisms to extend lifespan and eliminate disease onset.","authors":["Maiese, Kenneth","Kenneth Maiese"],"doi":"10.15761\/jts.1000138","first_seen_on":"2016-05-21T10:53:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2059-268X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of translational science","last_mentioned_on":1464828000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27200181?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27200181","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4869880\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4869880","pmid":"27200181","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"The bright side of reactive oxygen species: lifespan extension without cellular demise.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bright-side-reactive-oxygen-species-lifespan-extension-without-cellular-demise"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.858,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.858},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
