It is suggested that the genotype that carries thalassaemia and\/or the enzyme deficiency may have a high adaptive value in a malarial environment.It is concluded that there is a need further to investigate human genetic structure and the biological fitness of the principal genotype combinations in both existing environments and those that will result from continued cultural evolution.","altmetric_jid":"56a768dd2a83eeb12a8b4624","authors":["M.
