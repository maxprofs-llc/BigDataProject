Areas Covered: Endocardial stimulation rather than conventional epicardial pacing has been shown to: be more physiologically, improve electrical stimulation of the left ventricular, give less dispersion of repolarisation and result in better resynchronisation. The Wireless Cardiac Stimulation in Left Ventricle, WiCS-LV, system provides an option for wireless, left ventricular endocardial pacing triggered from a conventional right ventricular pacing spike from a co-implant. Expert Commentary: The feasibility of the WiCS-LV system has been successfully demonstrated in a population of failed cardiac resynchronisation patients, either failed implantation procedure of a conventional system, non-responder to conventional therapy or upgrade from pacemaker or defibrillator, where a conventional system was not an option. WiCS-LV is innovative technology with promising safety, performance and preliminary efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d3","authors":["M.
