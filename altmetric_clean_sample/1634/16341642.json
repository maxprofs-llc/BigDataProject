The factors affecting the metabolites extraction were optimized as follows: the volume of sample solution was 10 mL with pH 2 containing 0.5 mol\u00b7L(-1) sodium chloride, liquid membrane containing 1-octanol with 20% (w\/v) tributyl phosphate as the carrier, the time of extraction was 150 min, and stirring rate was 500 rpm. The organic phase immobilized in the pores of a hollow fiber was back-extracted into 24 \u00b5L of a solution containing sodium carbonate with pH 11, which was placed inside the lumen of the fiber. Under optimized conditions, the high enrichment factors of 172 and 195 folds, detection limit of 0.007 and 0.009 \u00b5g\u00b7mL(-1) were obtained. The relative standard deviation (RSD) (%) values for intra- and inter-day precisions were calculated at 2.5%-8.2% and 4.1%-10.7%, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of these metabolites in real urine samples. The results indicated that hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME) based on facilitated pH gradient transport can be used as a sensitive and effective method for the determination of mandelic acid and hippuric acid in urine specimens.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f2b","authors":["Abdulrahman Bahrami","Farhad Ghamari","Yadollah Yamini","Farshid Ghorbani Shahna","Abbas Moghimbeigi"],"doi":"10.3390\/membranes7010008","first_seen_on":"2017-02-12T09:33:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2077-0375"],"issue":"1","journal":"Membranes","last_mentioned_on":1487055192,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2077-0375\/7\/1\/8?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2077-0375\/7\/1\/8","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2077-0375\/7\/1\/8?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2077-0375\/7\/1\/8\/pdf","pmid":"28208685","pubdate":"2017-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Hollow Fiber Supported Liquid Membrane Extraction Combined with HPLC-UV for Simultaneous Preconcentration and Determination of Urinary Hippuric Acid and Mandelic Acid","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2077-0375\/7\/1\/8","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hollow-fiber-supported-liquid-membrane-extraction-combined-hplcuv-simultaneous-preconcentration-dete-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208063,"mean":6.9506291146371,"rank":3878360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4147175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208063,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268577,"mean":12.892741071428,"rank":130564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":130237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268577,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":1.0418918918919,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.64,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
