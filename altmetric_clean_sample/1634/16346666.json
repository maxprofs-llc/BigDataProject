Clinical observations suggest that many patients with 22q11.2DS suffer from severe fatigue. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the potential association between 22q11.2DS and fatigue. Twenty-nine patients (mean age 26.8, 18-38\u2009y) with 22q11.2DS completed the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI) measuring severity of fatigue. The results of the study group were compared with published population norms. In addition, cross-sectional associations between fatigue, depression (Beck Depression Inventory-BDI), and a quality of life questionnaire (WHO) in patients with 22q11.2 DS were examined. Subscales and total MFI scores were significantly higher in adults with 22q11.2DS. Approximately 80% of the study group had a total MFI score above the mean of the norms. A significant correlation between depressive symptoms and fatigue was found. Fatigue was also significantly associated with quality of life scores, specifically the general score, psychological health, and environment. This is the first report of high levels of fatigue in adults with the 22q11.2DS. Fatigue is a frequent complaint in this age group and should get the necessary attention given its association with quality of life and depression severity. Taking into account the multisystem nature of the 22q11.2DS, we recommend a systematic clinical examination to exclude underlying somatic or psychiatric causes of fatigue. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697d","authors":["Vergaelen, Elfi","Claes, Stephan","Kempke, Stefan","Swillen, Ann","Elfi Vergaelen","Stephan Claes","Stefan Kempke","Ann Swillen"],"doi":"10.1002\/ajmg.a.38094","first_seen_on":"2017-02-12T17:41:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-4833","15524825"],"journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics.
