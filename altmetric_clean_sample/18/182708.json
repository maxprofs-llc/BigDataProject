Therefore, it is important to know to what extent these parental reports are valid and whether it makes a difference if the parents measured their children's weight and height at home or whether they simply estimated these values. The aim of this study is to compare the validity of parent-reported height, weight and BMI values of preschool children (3-7 y-old), when measured at home or estimated by parents without actual measurement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b3","authors":["Inge Huybrechts","John H Himes","Charlene Ottevaere","Tineke De Vriendt","Willem De Keyzer","Bianca Cox","Inge Van Trimpont","Dirk De Bacquer","Stefaan De Henauw","Huybrechts I","Himes JH","Ottevaere C","De Vriendt T","De Keyzer W","Cox B","Van Trimpont I","De Bacquer D","De Henauw S"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2431-11-63","handle":"1854\/LU-1906505","handles":["1854\/LU-1906505"],"issns":["1471-2431",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1310151608,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2431\/11\/63","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2431-11-63","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2431-11-63"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2431-11-63.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3149571","pmid":"21736757","pubdate":"2011-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"63","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Validity of parent-reported weight and height of preschool children measured at home or estimated without home measurement: a validation study","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/validity-parentreported-weight-height-preschool-children-measured-home-estimated-without-home-measur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8163518,"mean":6.8970466082141,"rank":5911019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1958728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8163518,"percentile":23},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7531785,"mean":7.218473799827,"rank":5474867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1785647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7531785,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1094,"mean":5.1958536139067,"rank":785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1094,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1074,"mean":5.2612003727866,"rank":773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1074,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
