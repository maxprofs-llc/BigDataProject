The two common functional polymorphisms of MTHFR, 677 C\u2192T and 1298 A\u2192C, have been shown to impact various diseases, including cancer. The 677 C\u2192T polymorphism has been widely investigated in different cancers and has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of various cancers. We investigated MTHFR C677T genotype frequency in colorectal cancer cases in the Kashmiri population and correlated this information with the known clinicopathological characters of colorectal cancer, in a case-control study. Eighty-six colorectal cancer cases were studied for MTHFR C677T polymorphism, compared to 160 controls taken from the general population, employing the PCR-RFLP technique. We found the frequency of the three different genotypes of MTHFR in our ethnic Kashmir population, i.e., CC, CT and TT, to be 68.6, 20.9 and 10.4% among colorectal cancer cases and 75.6, 16.9 and 7.5% among the general control population, respectively. There was a significant association between the MTHFR TT genotype and colorectal cancer in the higher age group. We conclude that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism slightly increases the risk for colorectal cancer development in our ethnic Kashmir population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007523","doi":"10.4238\/vol10-2gmr1067","issns":["1676-5680"],"issue":"2","journal":"Genetics and Molecular Research","last_mentioned_on":1310076258,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21732284?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21732284","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Risk of colorectal cancer associated with the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism in the Kashmiri population.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-colorectal-cancer-associated-methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase-mthfr-c677t-polymorphism-kashm-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":981075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3441808,"mean":5.761742188843,"rank":2400196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":737084,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3441808,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":903,"mean":0.64626164079823,"rank":236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":903,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":773,"mean":0.67257512953368,"rank":203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":773,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Computer Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DK":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/NicholasMMurphy\/status\/89092400907157504","citation_ids":[182065],"posted_on":"2011-07-07T22:04:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Nick Murphy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/978677061\/345_n_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"nicholasmmurphy","tweeter_id":"74478819","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":814},"tweet_id":"89092400907157504"}]}}
