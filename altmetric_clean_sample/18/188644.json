The identification of biologically relevant pathways that influence frailty is challenged by its biological complexity and the necessity in separating disease states from the syndrome of frailty. As with longevity research, genetic analyses may help to provide insights into biologically relevant pathways that contribute to frailty.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fab","authors":["Y.-Y.
