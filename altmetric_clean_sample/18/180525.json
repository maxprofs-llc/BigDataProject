Recording movies and analyzing dynamics of individual macromolecules have brought new insights into the mechanisms of many processes in molecular biology, such as DNA-protein interactions, gene regulation, transcription, translation, and replication, among others. Here we review the key methods of single-molecule detection and highlight numerous examples to illustrate how these experiments are contributing to the quantitative understanding of the fundamental processes in a living cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002290","authors":["X.
