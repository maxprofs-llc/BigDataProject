Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 is a cytokine that maintains intestinal homeostasis, in part by inducing Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress immune responses. TGF-\u03b2 is expressed at high levels in the gastrointestinal tract as a latent complex that must be activated. However, the pathways that control TGF-\u03b2 activation in the intestine are poorly defined. We investigated the cellular and molecular pathways that control activation of TGF-\u03b2 and induction of Foxp3(+) Tregs in the intestines of mice to maintain immune homeostasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074fe","authors":["Worthington JJ","Czajkowska BI","Melton AC","Travis MA","John J.
