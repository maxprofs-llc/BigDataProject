Postprandial state is a pro-inflammatory condition associated with a transiently impaired endothelial function; an increased oxidative stress is considered as a mediator of such effects in T2D. We evaluated the short-term effect of a lipid meal on markers of early vascular damage in subjects at risk of developing T2D. A total of thirty-two healthy volunteers, divided according to the presence (FHD+) or absence (FHD\u00a0-\u00a0) of a family history of T2D, underwent a fatty meal test. We measured the monocyte mRNA expressions of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and nitrotyrosine plasma concentrations at baseline and in the post-meal phase, relating them to the lipid profile and other biochemical parameters. The basal expression of the cytokines did not differ in FHD\u00a0-\u00a0 and FHD+ subjects; neither was it modified by the meal ingestion. IL-6 and sCD40L plasma levels, similar in the two groups in the fasting state, did not vary after the meal. VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 increased in FHD+ subjects but not in FHD\u00a0-\u00a0 subjects. Nitrotyrosine, similar between the FHD\u00a0-\u00a0 and FHD+ subjects at baseline, increased more in FHD+ subjects than in FHD\u00a0-\u00a0 subjects after the meal. In conclusion, the presence of a familial history of T2D confers an abnormal endothelial activation after an oral lipid meal, coupled with an increased oxidative stress, supporting the hypothesis of an early endothelial dysfunction already present in healthy individuals prone to develop T2D.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000579a","doi":"10.1017\/s0007114511000286","first_seen_on":"2011-07-13T13:00:39+00:00","issns":["1475-2662"],"issue":"03","journal":"British Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1310560543,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8326068"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S0007114511000286","pmid":"21385511","pubdate":"2011-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"364","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Effect of a fatty meal on inflammatory markers in healthy volunteers with a family history of type 2 diabetes","type":"article","volume":"106","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-fatty-meal-inflammatory-markers-healthy-volunteers-family-history-type-2-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2327908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1535471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54624,"mean":4.9485167054171,"rank":24964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":21402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54624,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2393,"mean":6.2412056856187,"rank":1561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2393,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":5.0674545454545,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
