We review several major studies from Ochsner Medical Center demonstrating the high prevalence of psychological distress in CHD patients and the marked benefits that occur following formal cardiac rehabilitation and exercise training programs. These benefits include reductions in psychological stress, improvements in CHD risk factors that accompany high stress, and reduced all-cause mortality. These data support the benefits of exercise training and increased levels of fitness to improve psychological stress and subsequent prognosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005bd4","authors":["Carl J.
