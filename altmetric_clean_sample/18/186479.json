These materials were thus examined for effects on human leukocyte activity and on lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. It was revealed that these materials significantly increased intracellular calcium ion concentration, phagocytosis, and generation of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils, and the blastogenetic response of lymphocytes to mitogens. Chemotactic activity by neutrophils was also enhanced by exposure to tourmaline and the palm of \"Kikohshi\" i.e., a person who heals professionally by the laying on of hands. Despite the increase in reactive oxygen species generated by neutrophils, lipid peroxidation from unsaturated fatty acid was markedly inhibited by these four materials. The results suggest that materials emitting electromagnetic radiation in the far infrared range, which are widely used in Japan for cosmetic, therapeutic, and preservative purposes, appear capable of potentiating leukocyte functions without promoting oxidative injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b28","first_seen_on":"2011-07-12T17:46:09+00:00","issns":["0020-7128"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Biometeorology","last_mentioned_on":1382140260,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8406976"],"pmid":"8406976","pubdate":"1993-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Atmospheric Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Earth and Planetary Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Electromagnetic wave emitting products and \"Kikoh\" potentiate human leukocyte functions.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electromagnetic-wave-emitting-products-kikoh-potentiate-human-leukocyte-functions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4870132,"mean":5.7970808239066,"rank":1867189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2963156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4870132,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56076,"mean":5.390661827909,"rank":19394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":35931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56076,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":306,"mean":4.4111868852459,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":306,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":14.564666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/KikohReiki\/status\/90836396176187392","citation_ids":[186479],"posted_on":"2011-07-12T17:34:19+00:00","author":{"name":"kikoh Reiki","url":"http:\/\/www.kikohreiki.com","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/746705823\/Logo_72dpiRGB_small_normal.jpg","description":"A fresh modern perspective on chillaxin and unwinding for todays hetic urbanites","id_on_source":"kikohreiki","tweeter_id":"93861670","geo":{"lt":53.34807,"ln":-6.248274,"country":"IE"},"followers":100},"tweet_id":"90836396176187392"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/KikohReiki\/status\/391350733552885760","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[186479],"posted_on":"2013-10-18T23:51:00+00:00","author":{"name":"kikoh Reiki","url":"http:\/\/www.kikohreiki.com","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/746705823\/Logo_72dpiRGB_small_normal.jpg","description":"A fresh modern perspective on chillaxin and unwinding for todays hetic urbanites","id_on_source":"KikohReiki","tweeter_id":"93861670","geo":{"lt":53.34807,"ln":-6.248274,"country":"IE"},"followers":100},"tweet_id":"391350733552885760"}],"facebook":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=466745830035130&id=375998459109868","citation_ids":[186479],"posted_on":"2012-11-07T23:53:32+00:00","summary":"BONDADES DE LA TURMALINA\r\nSANACION, PROTECCION  Y MAS\r\n\r\n\u00bfQU\u00c9 ES LA TURMALINA?\r\n\r\nEs un mineral del grupo de los silicatos con una formulaci\u00f3n qu\u00edmica muy compleja.\r\n\r\nSe presenta en m\u00faltiples colores, algunos de ellos muy intensos, las variedades m\u00e1s frec","author":{"name":"Sanando Vidas","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/375998459109868","facebook_wall_name":"Sanando Vidas","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/375998459109868\/picture","id_on_source":"375998459109868"}},{"title":"Electromagnetic wave emitting products and...
