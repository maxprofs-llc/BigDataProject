A wide range of quinoline derivatives, including 2-alkylquinolines, 2-arylquinolines, and 2-functionalized and 2,3-disubstituted quinoline derivatives, were efficiently hydrogenated to give 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines with up to >99% ee and full conversions. This catalytic protocol is applicable to the gram-scale synthesis of some biologically active tetrahydroquinolines, such as (-)-angustureine, and 6-fluoro-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, a key intermediate for the preparation of the antibacterial agent (S)-flumequine. The catalytic pathway of this reaction has been investigated in detail using a combination of stoichiometric reaction, intermediate characterization, and isotope labeling patterns. The evidence obtained from these experiments revealed that quinoline is reduced via an ionic and cascade reaction pathway, including 1,4-hydride addition, isomerization, and 1,2-hydride addition, and hydrogen addition undergoes a stepwise H(+)\/H(-) transfer process outside the coordination sphere rather than a concerted mechanism. In addition, DFT calculations indicate that the enantioselectivity originates from the CH\/\u03c0 attraction between the \u03b7(6)-arene ligand in the Ru-complex and the fused phenyl ring of dihydroquinoline via a 10-membered ring transition state with the participation of TfO(-) anion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Tianli Wang","Lian-Gang Zhuo","Zhiwei Li","Fei Chen","Ziyuan Ding","Yanmei He","Qing-Hua Fan","Junfeng Xiang","Zhi-Xiang Yu","Albert S.
