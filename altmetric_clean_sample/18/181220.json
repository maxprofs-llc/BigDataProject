Upon activation, TLR7 and 9 are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to endolysosomes for nucleic acid sensing by an ER-resident protein, Unc93B1. Little is known, however, about a role for sensor transportation in controlling autoimmunity. TLR9 competes with TLR7 for Unc93B1-dependent trafficking and predominates over TLR7. TLR9 skewing is actively maintained by Unc93B1 and reversed to TLR7 if Unc93B1 loses preferential binding via a D34A mutation. We here demonstrate that mice harboring a D34A mutation showed TLR7-dependent, systemic lethal inflammation. CD4(+) T\u00a0cells showed marked differentiation toward T helper 1 (Th1) or Th17 cell subsets. B cell depletion abolished T\u00a0cell differentiation and systemic inflammation. Thus, Unc93B1 controls homeostatic TLR7 activation by balancing TLR9 to TLR7 trafficking.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a95","doi":"10.1016\/j.immuni.2011.05.010","issns":["1097-4180"],"journal":"Immunity","last_mentioned_on":1309997781,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21683627"],"pmid":"21683627","pubdate":"2011-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Unc93B1 Restricts Systemic Lethal Inflammation by Orchestrating Toll-like Receptor 7 and 9 Trafficking.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unc93b1-restricts-systemic-lethal-inflammation-orchestrating-tolllike-receptor-7-9-trafficking"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":981065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3441809,"mean":5.7617421854313,"rank":2400198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":737076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3441809,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1935,"mean":5.2055222337125,"rank":1545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1935,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1716,"mean":4.853421574344,"rank":1363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1716,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
