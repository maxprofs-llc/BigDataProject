While tools are available for aligning sets of reads to genomes and interpreting the results, fewer tools have been developed to address the storage and retrieval requirements of large collections of aligned datasets. We present ReadDB, a network accessible column store database system for aligned high-throughput read datasets.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["P Alexander Rolfe","P Alexander Rolfe","David K Gifford"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-12-278","issns":["","1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1311046334,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/12\/278"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-12-278.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3143109","pmid":"21736741","pubdate":"2011-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"278","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"ReadDB Provides Efficient Storage for Mapped Short Reads","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/automatic-fitness-generative-jazz"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":1006113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2929895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3441968,"mean":5.765337529195,"rank":849832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2182043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3441968,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2646,"mean":4.2870865784499,"rank":902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2646,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2517,"mean":4.3657488076312,"rank":896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":1534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2517,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
