Congenital defects, hematologic tumors, and intrauterine growth retardation can occur during childhood. This study evaluated clinical and laboratory treatment approaches in children diagnosed with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutations. Our group included 23 boys and 14 girls, aged 103.4 \u00b1 70.8 months S.D. Clinical findings of patients and homocysteine, vitamin B12, folate, hemogram, electroencephalography, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, and echocardiography data were evaluated in terms of treatment approach. Our patients' findings included vitamin B12 at 400.4 \u00b1 224.6 pg\/mL S.D. (normal range, 300-700 pg\/mL), folate at 10.1 \u00b1 4.5 ng\/mL S.D. (normal range, 1.8-9 ng\/mL), and homocysteine at 8.4 \u00b1 4.7 \u03bcmol\/L S.D. (normal range, 5.5-17 \u03bcmol\/L). Eighty-eight percent of patients demonstrated clinical findings. In comparisons involving categorical variables between groups, \u03c7(2) tests were used. No relationship was evident between mutation type, laboratory data, and clinical severity. All mothers who had MTHFR mutations and had babies with sacral dimples had taken folate supplements during pregnancy. To avoid the risk of neural tube defects, pregnant women with a MTHFR mutation may require higher than normally recommended doses of folic acid supplementation for optimum health.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b1","authors":["\u00d6zer I","\u00d6z\u00e7etin M","Karaer H","Kurt SG","\u015eahin \u015e"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pediatrneurol.2011.01.019","issns":["1873-5150","0887-8994"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pediatric Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1447944168,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21723457?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21723457","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.pediatrneurol.2011.01.019"],"pmid":"21723457","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Retrospective Approach to Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase Mutations in Children","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retrospective-approach-methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase-mutations-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6585900,"mean":6.1107691393388,"rank":2203660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4360814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6585900,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5652108,"mean":6.6897578718882,"rank":1951383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3681790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5652108,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1018,"mean":2.3769636184857,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1018,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":787,"mean":2.7099643765903,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":787,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
