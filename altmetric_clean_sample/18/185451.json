Aged beta-pol(+\/-) mice express 50% less beta-pol transcripts and protein (P < 0.05) than aged beta-pol(+\/+) mice, showing maintenance of the heterozygous state over the life span of the mouse. This reduction in beta-pol expression was not associated with an increase in mutation rate but was associated with a 100% increase in the onset of hypoploidy. Aged beta-pol(+\/-) mice exhibited a 6.7-fold increase in developing lymphoma (P < 0.01). Accordingly, 38% of beta-pol(+\/-) mice exhibited lymphoid hyperplasia, whereas none of the beta-pol(+\/+) exhibited this phenotype. beta-pol(+\/-) mice were also more likely to develop adenocarcinoma (2.7-fold increase; P < 0.05) and more likely to develop multiple tumors, as 20% of the beta-pol(+\/-) animals died bearing multiple tumors compared with only 5% of the beta-pol(+\/+) animals (P < 0.05). In spite of accelerated tumor development, no gross effect of beta-pol heterozygosity was seen with respect to life span. However, the survival curves for the beta-pol(+\/+) and beta-pol(+\/-) mice are not identical. A maximum likelihood estimation analysis showed a modest but significant (P < 0.05) acceleration of the age-dependent mortality rate in beta-pol(+\/-) mice. Thus, the beta-pol(+\/-) mouse represents a model in which mortality rate and tumor development are accelerated and provides evidence supporting the role of genomic maintenance in both aging and carcinogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["D.
