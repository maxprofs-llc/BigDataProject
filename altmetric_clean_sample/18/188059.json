Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a new therapeutic modality for ARDS because MSCs can attenuate inflammation and repair the damaged tissue by differentiating into several cell types. Macrophages participate in the development of ARDS; however, MSCs only weakly modulate macrophage function. The chemokine CCL2 is a potent inducer of macrophage recruitment and activation, and its expression is elevated in patients with ARDS. We established MSCs that are stably transduced by a lentiviral vector expressing 7ND, a dominant-negative inhibitor of CCL2, to enhance the therapeutic function of MSCs. 7ND-MSCs retained the innate properties of MSCs and produced a large amount of 7ND. Many 7ND-MSCs were detected in bleomycin-treated lungs (immunostaining 24 hours after injection), suggesting that MSCs could work as a drug delivery tool. Mice treated with 7ND-MSCs showed significantly milder weight loss, lung injury, collagen content, accumulation of inflammatory cells and inflammatory mediators that were induced by bleomycin, and subsequent survival benefit. No evidence of 7ND-MSC-induced toxicity was observed during or after treatment. Thus, inhibiting the effects of macrophages may greatly enhance the ability of MSCs to effect lung repair in ARDS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006988","doi":"10.1016\/j.ajpath.2011.05.027","first_seen_on":"2011-07-14T08:26:02+00:00","issns":["1525-2191"],"journal":"American Journal of Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1310630673,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21741938?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21741938","pubdate":"2011-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells Stably Transduced with a Dominant-Negative Inhibitor of CCL2 Greatly Attenuate Bleomycin-Induced Lung Damage.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mesenchymal-stem-cells-stably-transduced-dominantnegative-inhibitor-ccl2-greatly-attenuate-bleomycin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":2328577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1533985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54727,"mean":4.9722784416913,"rank":25433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":20428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54727,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1618,"mean":3.1405392702536,"rank":717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1618,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.52645,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
