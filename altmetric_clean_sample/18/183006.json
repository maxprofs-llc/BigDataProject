The social networks of service users often decrease significantly following the first onset, although many will remain in close contact with some family members particularly during the early phases. However, the negative impact of psychosis on families and their relationship with the identified service user are well documented. Family intervention is a recommended and evidence-based treatment in later psychosis. In this paper, we review the literature on family interventions in early psychosis in the context of new evidence for its efficacy and its routine incorporation in early intervention services for psychosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f6100072c6","issns":["2045-7960"],"issue":"2","journal":"Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1310497509,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21714356?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21714356","pubdate":"2011-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["epidemiology","psychiatry"],"title":"Family interventions in early psychosis: specificity and effectiveness.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/family-interventions-early-psychosis-specificity-effectiveness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":1786773,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2631910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3441619,"mean":5.7487532319873,"rank":1414331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":1969819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3441619,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255,"mean":2.8815196850394,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":3.2956494845361,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
