Although current understanding of both cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is significant, how their activity generates this prototypical dynamics is not understood yet. In order to gain insight about the mechanisms that drive these relapsing-remitting dynamics, we developed a computational model using such biological knowledge. We hypothesized that the relapsing dynamics in autoimmunity can arise through the failure in the mechanisms controlling cross-regulation between regulatory and effector T cells with the interplay of stochastic events (e.g. failure in central tolerance, activation by pathogens) that are able to trigger the immune system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007db","authors":["Nieves V\u00e9lez de Mendiz\u00e1bal","Nieves V\u00e9lez de Mendiz\u00e1bal","Jorge Carneiro","Ricard V Sol\u00e9","Joaqu\u00edn Go\u00f1i","Jean Bragard","Ivan Martinez-Forero","Sara Martinez-Pasamar","Jorge Sepulcre","Javier Torrealdea","Francesca Bagnato","Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo","Pablo Villoslada"],"doi":"10.1186\/1752-0509-5-114","first_seen_on":"2011-07-15T17:09:33+00:00","issns":["","1752-0509"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Systems Biology","last_mentioned_on":1374868678,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1752-0509\/5\/114","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1752-0509\/5\/114\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1752-0509-5-114.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3155504","pmid":"21762505","pubdate":"2011-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"114","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Modeling the effector - regulatory T cell cross-regulation reveals the intrinsic character of relapses in Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modeling-effector-regulatory-t-cell-crossregulation-reveals-intrinsic-character-relapses-multiple-sc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229091,"mean":5.9655632456766,"rank":1324415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":4897313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229091,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59315,"mean":5.7735375459419,"rank":15833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":43459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59315,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":777,"mean":3.1139639175258,"rank":157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":777,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":2.1901818181818,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
