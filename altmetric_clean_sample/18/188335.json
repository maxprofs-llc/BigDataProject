The design is based on chirped-pulse Fourier-transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy [G. G. Brown, B. C. Dian, K. O. Douglass, S. M. Geyer, S. T. Shipman, and B. H. Pate, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 79, 053103 (2008)], which is described for frequencies up to 20 GHz. We have built an instrument that covers the 70-102 GHz frequency region and can acquire up to 12 GHz of spectrum in a single shot. Challenges to using chirped-pulse Fourier-transform spectroscopy in the millimeter-wave region include lower achievable sample polarization, shorter Doppler dephasing times, and problems with signal phase stability. However, these challenges have been partially overcome and preliminary tests indicate a significant advantage over existing millimeter-wave spectrometers in the time required to record survey spectra. Further improvement to the sensitivity is expected as more powerful broadband millimeter-wave amplifiers become affordable. The ability to acquire broadband Fourier-transform millimeter-wave spectra enables rapid measurement of survey spectra at sufficiently high resolution to measure diagnostically important electronic properties such as electric and magnetic dipole moments and hyperfine coupling constants. It should also yield accurate relative line strengths across a broadband region. Several example spectra are presented to demonstrate initial applications of the spectrometer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011JChPh.135b4202P","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["G.
