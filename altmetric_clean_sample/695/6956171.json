The structures of the new compounds were determined by spectroscopic methods and comparison with previously described compounds. Compound 5 showed almost 4-fold activation of pregnane X receptor, while 2 inhibited BACE1 with an IC50 value of 82 \u03bcM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8b","authors":["Jingqiu Dai","Dai, Jingqiu","Yoshida, Wesley Y","Kelly, Michelle","Williams, Philip"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jnatprod.6b00042","first_seen_on":"2016-04-25T23:30:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6025","0163-3864"],"journal":"Journal of Natural Products","last_mentioned_on":1461283200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.jnatprod.6b00042"],"pmid":"27104967","pubdate":"2016-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"\n              Pregnane-10,2-carbolactones from a Hawaiian Marine Sponge in the Genus\n              Myrmekioderma\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pregnane102carbolactones-hawaiian-marine-sponge-genus-myrmekioderma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7584550,"mean":6.538792679956,"rank":1039258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6478217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7584550,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266507,"mean":11.404669906118,"rank":53677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":209128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266507,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1520,"mean":3.8863028308097,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":1352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1520,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":5.2078620689655,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
