Reproductive risk factors, benign breast disease, use of postmenopausal hormones, weight, and alcohol intake were evaluated as risk factors. Among 58,520 women aged 30-55 years in 1980, followed through June 1, 1994, 1,761 incident invasive breast cancer cases were identified. All risks are multivariate adjusted. History of benign breast disease is associated with a 57% increase (95% confidence interval (CI): 43%, 73%) in cumulative risk of breast cancer by age 70 years. Use of unopposed postmenopausal estrogen from ages 50-60 years increases risk of breast cancer to age 70 by 23% (95% CI: 6%, 42%) compared with a woman who never uses hormones. Ten years of use of estrogen plus progestin increases risk to age 70 years by 67% (95% CI: 18%, 136%). Compared with never drinking alcohol, one drink per day from age 18 years increases risk to age 70 by 7% (95% CI: 0%, 13%). Use of unopposed postmenopausal hormones for 10 years significantly increases the risk of breast cancer, and the addition of progestin further increases the risk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f7","authors":["Graham A.
