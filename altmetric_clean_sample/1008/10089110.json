Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is perhaps the best-defined tumor marker for HCC, and as such, it is widely used in clinical settings as an adjuvant diagnostic and prognostic tool. Up to 70% of HCC cases exhibit elevated serum level of AFP, but its pathophysiological functions in HCC are poorly defined. It is now known that AFP is not just a fetal form of carrier protein and a tumor marker, it is also critically involved in the regulation of several important cellular functions, such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and immune regulation. In this mini-review, we summarize the recent development of AFP in hepatocellular carcinoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007141","authors":["Meng, Wenbo","Bai, Bing","Bai, Zhongtian","Li, Yan","Yue, Ping","Li, Xun","Qiao, Liang"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-28T10:26:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-7930"],"issue":"118","journal":"Discovery Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1469701546,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27448785?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27448785","pubdate":"2016-07-28T22:47:47+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The immunosuppression role of alpha-fetoprotein in human hepatocellular carcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunosuppression-role-alphafetoprotein-human-hepatocellular-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148366,"mean":6.8920487793494,"rank":7056581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148366,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257952,"mean":11.978910242643,"rank":218140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257952,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218,"mean":2.3595299539171,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.25,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/758609386088521728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10089110],"posted_on":"2016-07-28T10:25:46+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"758609386088521728"}]}}
