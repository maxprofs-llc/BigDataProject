This document updates the ISCEV standard for clinical VEP testing and supersedes the 2009 standard. The main changes in this revision are the acknowledgment that pattern stimuli can be produced using a variety of technologies with an emphasis on the need for manufacturers to ensure that there is no luminance change during pattern reversal or pattern onset\/offset. The document is also edited to bring the VEP standard into closer harmony with other ISCEV standards. The ISCEV standard VEP is based on a subset of stimulus and recording conditions that provide core clinical information and can be performed by most clinical electrophysiology laboratories throughout the world. These are: (1) Pattern-reversal VEPs elicited by checkerboard stimuli with large 1 degree (\u00b0) and small 0.25\u00b0 checks. (2) Pattern onset\/offset VEPs elicited by checkerboard stimuli with large 1\u00b0 and small 0.25\u00b0 checks. (3) Flash VEPs elicited by a flash (brief luminance increment) which subtends a visual field of at least 20\u00b0. The ISCEV standard VEP protocols are defined for a single recording channel with a midline occipital active electrode. These protocols are intended for assessment of the eye and\/or optic nerves anterior to the optic chiasm. Extended, multi-channel protocols are required to evaluate postchiasmal lesions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000715c","authors":["J. Vernon Odom","Michael Bach","Mitchell Brigell","Graham E.
