The quality of included trials was assessed according to the handbook for Cochrane reviewer. Statistical analysis was carried out by RevMan5.1 software.\n30 randomized controlled trials containing 3854 patients were contained in our meta-analysis, the results indicated that postoperative SEN could absolutely reduce the incidence of postoperative infectious (P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001) and non-infectious complications (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0003), together with its positive effect on the length of hospital stay (P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001). Additionally, enteral nutrition enhanced with immune stimulation was confirmed to be better, with a significant difference between groups in terms of total infectious (P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001) and non-infectious complications (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04), and IEN could also significantly shorten the length of hospital stay (P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001).\nEarly use of Enteral nutrition in digestive tumor patients after surgery could significantly reduce the postoperative complications and shorten the length of hospital stay, IEN should be the optimal management, while the use of parenteral nutrition should be restrict to few patients with severe intolerance to enteral nutrition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000580d","authors":["Yan, Xia","Zhou, Fu-Xiang","Lan, Tian","Xu, Hui","Yang,
