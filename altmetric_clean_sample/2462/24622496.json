Traditionally, anterolateral emergency department thoracotomy is used for temporary control of noncompressible torso hemorrhage and to increase preload after trauma. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta is a minimally invasive technique that achieves similar goals. It is therefore imperative for the anesthesiologist to understand physiologic implications during resuscitative endovascular aortic occlusion and after balloon deflation. We report a case of a patient with significant pelvic and lower-extremity trauma who required acute resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta deployment, aggressive resuscitation, and extensive intraoperative hemorrhage control.","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb62a83ee005f8b4577","authors":["Conti, Bianca M.","Richards, Justin E.","Kundi, Rishi","Nascone, Jason","Scalea, Thomas M.","McCunn, Maureen"],"doi":"10.1213\/xaa.0000000000000461","first_seen_on":"2017-09-01T16:44:19+00:00","issns":["2325-7237"],"issue":"5","journal":"A&A Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1504284244,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aacr\/Fulltext\/2017\/09010\/Resuscitative_Endovascular_Balloon_Occlusion_of.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/aacr\/2017\/09010\/Resuscitative_Endovascular_Balloon_Occlusion_of.8.pdf","pmid":"28379869","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","startpage":"154","title":"Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta and the Anesthesiologist","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aacr\/Fulltext\/2017\/09010\/Resuscitative_Endovascular_Balloon_Occlusion_of.8.aspx","volume":"9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":4520080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2356142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173831,"mean":12.402057285854,"rank":94864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":61462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173831,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":334,"mean":1.4205705705706,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":334,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.175,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dr_tgro\/statuses\/903659732665290753","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24622496],"posted_on":"2017-09-01T16:44:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Taras Grosh, MD","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/890749038575878145\/feJIKbKA_normal.jpg","description":"Orthopedic & Regional Anesthesiologist interested in acute in chronic pain management, OR sustainability and reducing waste streams","id_on_source":"dr_tgro","tweeter_id":"824033399480389633","geo":{"lt":39.95234,"ln":-75.16379,"country":"US"},"followers":182},"tweet_id":"903659732665290753"}]}}
