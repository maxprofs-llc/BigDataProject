The use of more biocompatible materials such as titanium and PEEK is becoming more prevalent in NHP research. We describe a cost-effective set of procedures that maximizes the integration of headposts and recording cylinders with the animal's tissues while reducing surgery time. Nine rhesus monkeys were implanted with titanium headposts and one of these was also implanted with a recording chamber. In each case, a 3D printed replica of the skull was created based on computerized tomography scans. The titanium feet of the headposts were shaped and the skull thickness measured pre-operatively, reducing surgery time by up to 70%. The recording cylinder was manufactured to conform tightly to the skull, which was fastened to the skull with 4 screws and remained watertight for 8.5 months. We quantified the amount of regression of the skin edge at the headpost. We found a large degree of variability in the timing and extent of skin regression that could not be explained by any single recorded factor. However, there was not a single case of bone exposure: while skin retracted from the titanium, skin also remained adhered to the skull adjacent to those regions. The headposts remained fully functional and free of complications for the experimental life of each animal, several of which are still participating in experiments over 4 years after implant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e78","authors":["Jacqueline A Overton","Dylan F.
