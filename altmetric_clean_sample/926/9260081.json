After EAE initiation, CIG was intragastrically administered daily for 32\u00a0days and reduced disease severity. Histopathological staining and western blotting both showed that CIG could prevent brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) loss in the spinal cord of EAE mice. In conclusion, our findings indicated that CIG treatment suppressed disease severity of EAE partially through blocking downregulation of neurotrophic factor expression such as BDNF and NGF, suggesting that CIG may have beneficial effects for the treatment of demyelinating diseases such as MS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000829e","authors":["Qu, Zhao","Zheng, Na","Zhang, Yifan","Zhang, Li","Liu, Jianghong","Wang, Qi","Yin, Linlin"],"doi":"10.1080\/01616412.2016.1200766","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2016-07-05T21:04:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1743-1328","0161-6412"],"journal":"Neurological Research","last_mentioned_on":1467752620,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27373350?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27373350","pubdate":"2016-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Preventing the BDNF and NGF loss involved in the effects of cornel iridoid glycoside on attenuation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preventing-bdnf-ngf-loss-involved-effects-cornel-iridoid-glycoside-attenuation-experimental-autoimmu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":6914575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260266,"mean":11.510729064607,"rank":218680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260266,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330,"mean":2.6736474164134,"rank":266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.9772727272727,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MltplSclppr\/statuses\/750434996658114561","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9260081],"posted_on":"2016-07-05T21:03:40+00:00","author":{"name":"MS Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/599614030790008833\/7IuEjHC7_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"MltplSclppr","tweeter_id":"3262004991","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":211},"tweet_id":"750434996658114561"}]}}
