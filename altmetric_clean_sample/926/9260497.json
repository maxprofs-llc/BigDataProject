Deacetylation of the latter at C-7 with imidazole in 1,4-dioxane at 40\u00b0C furnished the corresponding diacetate in 80% yield. Methylation of the obtained free hydroxy group and subsequent removal of the remaining two acetyl groups gave sakuranetin, which was previously isolated as a phytoalexin against rice blast disease fungus, Pyricularia oryzae, in 71% overall yield. The same intermediate, naringenin triacetate, was subjected to transesterification with 2-propanol in tetrahydrofuran, catalyzed by Candida antarctica lipase B. A contrasting regioselective preference for C-4' deacetylation was observed, giving an isomeric diacetate in 82% yield. Prenylation of the free hydroxy group under Mitsunobu conditions and subsequent deprotection furnished selinone, which was previously isolated from Monotes engleri and exhibits antifungal activity against Candida albicans, in 55% overall yield.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e40","authors":["Yamashita, Yasunobu","Hanaya, Kengo","Shoji, Mitsuru","Sugai, Takeshi"],"doi":"10.1248\/cpb.c16-00190","endpage":"965","first_seen_on":"2016-07-05T21:19:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1347-5223","0009-2363"],"issue":"7","journal":"Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1467753543,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27373654?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27373654","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"961","subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Simple Synthesis of Sakuranetin and Selinone <i>via<\/i> a Common Intermediate, Utilizing Complementary Regioselectivity in the Deacetylation of Naringenin Triacetate","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simple-synthesis-sakuranetin-selinone-via-common-untermediate-utilizing-complementary-regioselectivi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":6914558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260267,"mean":11.510663321371,"rank":218670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260267,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":505,"mean":2.1701349206349,"rank":435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":505,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
