Noncoding RNAs play essential regulatory roles in a broad range of developmental processes and diseases, notably human cancers. Regulatory ncRNAs represent multiple levels of structurally and functionally distinct RNAs, including the best-known microRNAs (miRNAs), the complicated long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and the newly identified circular RNAs (circRNAs). However, the mechanisms by which they act remain elusive. In this chapter, we will review the current knowledge of the ncRNA field, discussing the genomic context, biological functions, and mechanisms of action of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs. We also highlight the implications of the biogenesis and gene expression dysregulation of different ncRNA subtypes in the initiation and development of human malignancies.","aggregated_in":[11010819],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd24","authors":["Chen, Xueman","Fan, Siting","Song, Erwei","Xueman Chen","Siting Fan","Erwei Song"],"book":{"title":"The Long and Short Non-coding RNAs in Cancer Biology","isbns":["9789811014963","9789811014987"],"uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/book\/10.1007%2F978-981-10-1498-7"},"doi":"10.1007\/978-981-10-1498-7_1","editors":["Erwei Song"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-06T01:41:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0065-2598","2214-8019"],"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","last_mentioned_on":1467778776,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27376730?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/978-981-10-1498-7_1"],"ordinal_number":1,"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F978-981-10-1498-7_1.pdf","pmid":"27376730","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Singapore","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"series":{"title":"Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology","issn":"0065-2598"},"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"The Long and Short Non-coding RNAs in Cancer Biology","type":"chapter","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007%2F978-981-10-1498-7_1","volume":"927","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/noncoding-rnas-new-players-cancers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002013,"mean":6.750266627688,"rank":6067473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1078363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002013,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260070,"mean":11.521608973003,"rank":182698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260070,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2339,"mean":3.2039726261762,"rank":1413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2339,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.5434615384615,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
