While there is a strong emphasis for older people to maintain their mobility, the safety of older drivers is a serious community concern. Frailty and declines in a range of age-related sensory, cognitive, and physical impairments can place older drivers at an increased risk of crash-related injuries and death. A number of studies have indicated that in-vehicle technologies such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVIS) may provide assistance to older drivers. However, these technologies will only benefit older drivers if their design is congruent with the complex needs and diverse abilities of this driving cohort. The design of ADAS and IVIS is largely informed by automotive Human Machine Interface (HMI) guidelines. However, it is unclear to what extent the declining sensory, cognitive and physical capabilities of older drivers are addressed in the current guidelines. This paper provides a review of key current design guidelines for IVIS and ADAS with respect to the extent they address age-related changes in functional capacities. The review revealed that most of the HMI guidelines do not address design issues related to older driver impairments. In fact, in many guidelines driver age and sensory cognitive and physical impairments are not mentioned at all and where reference is made, it is typically very broad. Prescriptive advice on how to actually design a system so that it addresses the needs and limitations of older drivers is not provided. In order for older drivers to reap the full benefits that in-vehicle technology can afford, it is critical that further work establish how older driver limitations and capabilities can be supported by the system design process, including their inclusion into HMI design guidelines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213e","authors":["Young, K L","Koppel, S","Charlton, J L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aap.2016.06.010","first_seen_on":"2016-07-06T01:39:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-2057","00014575"],"journal":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1467769145,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27374247?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27374247","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Transportation And Freight Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Toward best practice in Human Machine Interface design for older drivers: A review of current design guidelines","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toward-best-practice-human-machine-interface-design-older-drivers-review-current-design-guidelines-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002013,"mean":6.750266627688,"rank":6924581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002013,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260069,"mean":11.521735176954,"rank":218524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260069,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2494,"mean":5.590678700361,"rank":1932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2494,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":3.181775,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
