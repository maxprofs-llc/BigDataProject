Response varies between individuals. Gene expression integrates genetic and environmental influences. We analysed the effect of gene expression and genetic markers separately and together on treatment response.\nAdult participants (n\u2264181) diagnosed with panic disorder or a specific phobia underwent eCBT as part of standard care. Percentage decrease in the Clinical Global Impression severity rating was assessed across treatment, and between baseline and a six month follow-up. Associations with treatment response were assessed using expression data from 3,233 probes, and expression profiles clustered in a data-driven and literature-driven manner. 3,343,497 genetic variants were used to predict treatment response alone and combined in polygenic risk scores. Genotype and expression data were combined in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses.\nExpression levels were not associated with either treatment phenotype in any analysis. 1,492 eQTLs were identified with q<0.05, but interactions between genetic variants and treatment response did not affect expression levels significantly. Genetic variants did not significantly predict treatment response alone or in polygenic risk scores.\nWe assessed gene expression alone and alongside genetic variants. No associations with treatment outcome were identified. Future studies require larger sample sizes to discover associations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53c3cf058f61000472c","authors":["Coleman, Jonathan R I","Lester, Kathryn J","Roberts, Susanna","Keers, Robert","Lee, Sang Hyuck","De Jong, Simone","Gaspar, Helena","Teismann, Tobias","Wannem\u00fcller, Andr\u00e9","Schneider, Silvia","J\u00f6hren, Peter","Margraf, J\u00fcrgen","Breen, Gerome","Eley, Thalia C","Jonathan R.I.
