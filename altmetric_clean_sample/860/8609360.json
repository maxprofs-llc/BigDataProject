We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing post-transplant outcomes in these 2 populations.\nAfter conducting an electronic database search, we selected studies evaluating mortality, cause-specific mortality, and risk of reoperation and dialysis in adult CHD vs non-CHD patients. We used random-effects models for the meta-analysis.\nThirty-day mortality was significantly higher in CHD vs non-CHD patients (risk ratio [RR], 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-2.93; I(2) = 41%). This was influenced by increased mortality in Fontan\/Glenn patients compared with non-CHD patients (RR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.89-5.77; I(2) = 0%). Mortality at 1 and 5 years was higher in the CHD population, although neither achieved statistical significance. Ten-year mortality was significantly lower in CHD patients (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.95, I(2) = 42%). Deaths caused by malignancy, infection, rejection, and cardiac allograft vasculopathy were decreased in CHD patients, although only death from malignancy achieved significance. Death secondary to primary graft failure, stroke, and hemorrhage was significantly higher in CHD patients. Risk of reoperation and dialysis were not statistically different between the 2 groups.\nAlthough adult CHD patients have higher early mortality, post-transplantation long-term survival is superior to non-CHD recipients. The challenge is to identify the CHD patients who will benefit from transplantation vs those who are higher risk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd6","authors":["Barbara Stella Doumouras","Ana Carolina Alba","Farid Foroutan","Luke James Burchill","Dipchand Anne Indira","Heather Joan Ross"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.healun.2016.06.003","first_seen_on":"2016-06-09T12:43:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-3117"],"journal":"Journal of Heart & Lung Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1465478345,"links":["http:\/\/www.jhltonline.org\/article\/S1053-2498(16)30167-X\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jhltonline.org\/article\/S105324981630167X\/pdf","pmid":"27431751","pubdate":"2016-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Outcomes in adult congenital heart disease patients undergoing heart transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-adult-congenital-heart-disease-patients-undergoing-heart-transplantation-systematic-review-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7876706,"mean":6.669712343671,"rank":3839431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3975896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7876706,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268679,"mean":11.393022026366,"rank":130763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":135120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268679,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":626,"mean":3.1770464,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":626,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.6910714285714,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"UZ":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrDePasquale\/statuses\/740881632060669952","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8609360],"posted_on":"2016-06-09T12:22:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Eugene DePasquale MD","url":"http:\/\/uclahealth.org\/EugeneDePasquale","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/605208205099040769\/OSg6Xqew_normal.jpg","description":"Assoc Director, #HF, #HeartTransplant & #VAD Program |Interests: #HeartFailure, #HeartTransplant, #VAD, #SportsCardiology, #HCM, #Tennis | Opinions are my own.","id_on_source":"DrDePasquale","tweeter_id":"1466319950","geo":{"lt":41.70754,"ln":63.84911,"country":"UZ"},"followers":889},"tweet_id":"740881632060669952"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hearthealthydoc\/statuses\/740895997421838338","license":"gnip","rt":["DrDePasquale"],"citation_ids":[8609360],"posted_on":"2016-06-09T13:19:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Heather Ross","url":"http:\/\/www.testyourlimits.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/829739962119630849\/5hidXqmO_normal.jpg","description":"Heart Failure Doctor, Director of Ted Rogers Centre of Excellence in Heart Function, Leader of TestYourLimits.
