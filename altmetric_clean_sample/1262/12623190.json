They are present since the early stages of the disease and have negative impact on the disease process. BPSD assessment is crucial in clinical practice and also in future clinical trials targeting disease-modifying therapies for dementia. In this article, we will first review current assessment tools for BPSD, mainly global and domain-specific scales, and new assessment methods, currently available or in development, including new scales, diagnostic criteria and new technologies such as ambulatory actigraphy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043bf","authors":["David, Renaud","Mulin, Emmanuel","Mallea, Patrick","Robert, Philippe H"],"doi":"10.3390\/ph3082387","endpage":"2397","first_seen_on":"2016-10-15T00:31:48+00:00","issns":["1424-8247"],"issue":"8","journal":"Pharmaceuticals","last_mentioned_on":1476486881,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27713359"],"pmid":"27713359","pubdate":"2010-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2387","title":"Measurement of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Clinical Trials Targeting Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measurement-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-clinical-trials-targeting-alzheimers-disease-related-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7540906,"mean":6.5135694142772,"rank":1031067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6443140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7540906,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239168,"mean":12.414539530955,"rank":50212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":185530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239168,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273,"mean":3.2503823529412,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":4.428125,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"FR":1,"CH":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Measurement of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Clinical Trials Targeting Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=28283987649&p=1pl&v=1&x=rJPvmIu3n7EpHAcZGnCpzw","license":"public","citation_ids":[12623190],"posted_on":"2016-10-14T23:14:41+00:00","summary":".
