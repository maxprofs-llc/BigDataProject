However, GCxGC\/TOF-MS data processing is currently limited to vendor software and typically requires several preprocessing steps. In this work, we implement a web-based platform, which we call GC(2)MS, to facilitate the application of recent advances in GCxGC\/TOF-MS, especially for metabolomics studies. The core processing workflow of GC(2)MS consists of blob\/peak detection, baseline correction, and blob alignment. GC(2)MS treats GCxGC\/TOF-MS data as pictures and clusters the pixels as blobs according to the brightness of each pixel to generate a blob table. GC(2)MS then aligns the blobs of two GCxGC\/TOF-MS datasets according to their distance and similarity. The blob distance and similarity are the Euclidean distance of the first and second retention times of two blobs and the Pearson's correlation coefficient of the two mass spectra, respectively. GC(2)MS also directly corrects the raw data baseline. The analytical performance of GC(2)MS was evaluated using GCxGC\/TOF-MS datasets of Angelica sinensis compounds acquired under different experimental conditions and of human plasma samples. The results show that GC(2)MS is an easy-to-use tool for detecting peaks and correcting baselines, and GC(2)MS is able to align GCxGC\/TOF-MS datasets acquired under different experimental conditions.
