Methylglyoxal (MG) is a reactive dicarbonyl compound formed during glycolysis and reported to increase in kidney damage. Metformin is used as a MG scavenger in the clinic. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of Pb-induced renal injury and the effect of metformin on Pb-induced nephrotoxicity. Eighteen Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, Pb, and Pb\u2009+\u2009metformin groups. Pb (250\u2009ppm) was administered in drinking water, and 50\u2009mg\/Kg of metformin was co-administered orally. After 28\u2009days, the levels of MG and its metabolite d-lactate in urine, serum, and renal tissues were examined. The elevation of renal MG (56.86\u2009\u00b1\u200917.47 versus 36.40\u2009\u00b1\u20095.69, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and urinary d-lactate (0.68\u2009\u00b1\u20090.28 versus 0.32\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13, p\u2009<\u20090.01) were observed in Pb-exposed rats compared with those in control rats. After co-treatment with metformin, these phenomena were attenuated. In the present study, it was demonstrated for the first time that urinary d-lactate might serve as the candidate marker for Pb-induced nephrotoxicity in the clinic, and metformin might be a new therapeutic candidate for Pb poisoning.
