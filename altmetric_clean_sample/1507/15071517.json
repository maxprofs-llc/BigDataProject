The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) may also be sensitive to novelty as it responds to both uncertainty and threat. If so, a BNST novelty response may also be affected by trait anxiety and interact with stimulus negativity. We presented participants with novel and repeated negative and neutral images while measuring brain activity via fMRI, and assessed participants' self-reported trait anxiety. We expected to replicate past findings of novelty responses in the hippocampus and amygdala that are independent of stimulus negativity. We also expected BNST novelty-sensitivity and that trait anxiety would predict greater sensitivity to both novelty and negativity in the amygdala and BNST, but not the hippocampus. Our a priori analyses replicated past findings of a novelty response that was independent of valence in the hippocampus and amygdala. The BNST exhibited a novelty response for negative, but not neutral, images. Trait anxiety did not modulate the response to novelty or negativity in any of the ROIs investigated. Our findings suggest that the BNST plays a role in the detection of novelty.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045d6","authors":["Walker S. Pedersen","Nicholas L. Balderston","Tara A.
