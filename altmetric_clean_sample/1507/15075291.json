These telechelic supramolecular amphiphiles possess a rigid core and flexible corona. Increasing the multiarm host polymer coupled onto the rigid POSS core made the molecular architecture tend to be symmetrical and spherical. POSS-Azo8@[\u03b2-CD-PDMAEMA]1\u21928 could self-assemble into diverse morphologies evolving from spherical micelles, wormlike micelles, and branched aggregates to bowl-shaped vesicles. Distinct from the traditional linear amphiphilic polymers, we discovered that the self-assembly of POSS-Azo8@[\u03b2-CD-PDMAEMA]1\u21928 was dominantly regulated by their molecular architectures instead of hydrophilicity, which has also been verified using computer simulation results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Juan Wang"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.langmuir.6b03550","first_seen_on":"2016-12-26T08:20:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5827","0743-7463"],"issue":"51","journal":"Langmuir","last_mentioned_on":1482749434,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.langmuir.6b03550?utm_content=buffer86629&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer&"],"pmid":"27966989","pubdate":"2016-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Morphological Evolution of Self-Assembled Structures Induced by the Molecular Architecture of Supra-Amphiphiles","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/morphological-evolution-selfassembled-structures-induced-molecular-architecture-supraamphiphiles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7940332,"mean":6.711930007446,"rank":6019793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1067831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7940332,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252724,"mean":12.511594330551,"rank":179291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":45333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252724,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2744,"mean":2.8822026977762,"rank":1550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2744,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":2.0702380952381,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
