Increasing resistance to new generations of \u03b2-lactam and quinolone antibiotics in multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates is considered an emergency health issue worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolated from urinary tract infections (UTIs). In our study ESBL-producing isolates were assessed by screening methods. After determination of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, detection of ESBLs and quinolone resistance genes was performed. A total of 97 ESBL-producing E. coli were determined. The bla-TEM, bla-SHV and bla-CTX-M genes were detected in 90 isolates. The bla-TEM was the most frequently detected gene (46.4%), followed by bla-SHV (31.9%) and bla-CTX-M (14.4%). The most prevalent quinolone resistance gene among ESBL-producing isolates was oqxAB which was found in 67 isolates (69.1%). The frequencies of the aac(6')-Ib-cr, qnr and qepA were 65 (67%), 8 (8.2%) and 6 (6.2%), respectively. Our data indicate that the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in ESBL-positive isolates is increasing. The co-dissemination of PMQR and ESBL genes among E. coli isolates can be considered a threat to public health. Therefore, prescription of antibiotics against infectious disease should be managed carefully.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cea9","authors":["Tayebi, Zahra","Heidari, Hamid","Kazemian, Hossein","Ghafoori, Seyed Mohammad","Boroumandi, Shahram","Houri, Hamidreza"],"first_seen_on":"2016-12-26T07:24:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1124-9390"],"issue":"24","journal":"infezioni in medicina rivista periodica di eziologia epidemiologia diagnostica clinica e terapia delle patologie infettive","last_mentioned_on":1482747894,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28011969"],"pmid":"28011969","pubdate":"2016-12-26T22:04:24+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Comparison of quinolone and beta-lactam resistance among Escherichia coli strains isolated from urinary tract infections.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-quinolone-betalactam-resistance-among-escherichia-coli-strains-isolated-urinary-tract-inf-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7940332,"mean":6.711930007446,"rank":3236558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4660697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7940332,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252724,"mean":12.511585031833,"rank":99807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":150746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252724,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":1.6497011494253,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
