Advances in T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, and spectroscopic imaging are described along with advances related to radiofrequency coils and imaging at high magnetic field. As mpMRI is increasingly becoming routine in various aspects of clinical prostate cancer management, its role in detection, localization, staging, assessment of aggressiveness, and active surveillance is discussed. Combined with growing clinical adoption of the techniques already at hand, continual optimization of acquisition techniques and image interpretation schemes will further strengthen the role of mpMRI as an important diagnostic test in prostate cancer management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a7a","authors":["Scheenen, Tom W J","Rosenkrantz, Andrew B","Haider, Masoom A","F\u00fctterer, Jurgen J"],"doi":"10.1097\/rli.0000000000000163","first_seen_on":"2015-05-15T06:27:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-9996","1536-0210"],"issue":"9","journal":"Investigative Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1439787355,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Multiparametric_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_in.99315.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/Multiparametric_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_in.6.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/Fulltext\/2015\/09000\/Multiparametric_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_in.6.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/9000\/00000\/Multiparametric_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging_in.99315.pdf","pmid":"25974203","pubdate":"2015-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Management: Current Status and Future Perspectives","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiparametric-magnetic-resonance-imaging-prostate-cancer-management-current-status-future-perspect-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5492745,"mean":6.376680732254,"rank":3636472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1626910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5492745,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172085,"mean":9.2746445224426,"rank":115507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":48433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172085,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":894,"mean":1.1534826427772,"rank":252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":894,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.6882962962963,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
