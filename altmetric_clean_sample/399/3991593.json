However, an effort\/reward imbalance was not directly associated with work schedules (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.87-4.35). Among nurses working rotation rotating shifts, those who had 2 days off after their most recent night shifts showed an alleviated risk of overcommitment (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32-0.82), but those who had worked for at least one series of 7 consecutive work days per month had an increased risk of effort\/reward imbalance (OR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.69-4.48). Additionally, those who had little or no participation in planning working hours and shift scheduling and worked overtime at least three times per week during the preceding 2 months tended to have high stress.\nThe nurses who worked rotating shifts tended to experience work-related stress, but their stress levels improved if they had at least 2 days off after their most recent night shift and if they were not scheduled to work 7 consecutive days. These empirical data can be used to optimize work schedules for nurses to alleviate work stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dad","authors":["Lin, Pei-Chen","Chen, Chung-Hey","Pan, Shung-Mei","Chen, Yao-Mei","Pan, Chih-Hong","Hung, Hsin-Chia","Wu, Ming-Tsang"],"doi":"10.1539\/joh.13-0284-oa","first_seen_on":"2015-05-13T08:29:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1348-9585"],"journal":"Journal of Occupational Health","last_mentioned_on":1431599594,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25958974"],"pmid":"25958974","pubdate":"2015-05-13T22:06:43+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"The association between rotating shift work and increased occupational stress in nurses.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-rotating-shift-work-increased-occupational-stress-nurses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5098139,"mean":6.0408647239452,"rank":2467147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2581598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5098139,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162983,"mean":9.2756075640255,"rank":84047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":77325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162983,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":2.5529203539823,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.85,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
