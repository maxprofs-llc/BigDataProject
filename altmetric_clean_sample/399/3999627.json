Periodic monitoring of treated sites included recording of probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and gingival recession. Pretreatment and 1-year postoperative findings were statistically analyzed within and between groups.\nThe PD and CAL values decreased significantly with time, but not those between study groups. The mean pretreatment and 1-year post-treatment PDs of the IBDs of the GTR group (n=16; sites=67) were 8.93\u00b11.14mm and 3.58\u00b10.50mm, respectively, and the mean CALs were 9.03\u00b11.03mm and 4.16\u00b10.53mm, respectively. The mean PDs of the EMD\/DBX group (n=16; sites=73) were 8.77\u00b11.04mm mm and 3.61\u00b10.36mm, respectively, and the mean CALS were 8.79\u00b11.04mm and 3.77\u00b10.22mm, respectively (p<0.001 for all).\nSurgical treatment of AgP patients by either GTR or by application of EMD\/DBX yielded similarly successful clinical results at 1-year post-treatment.
