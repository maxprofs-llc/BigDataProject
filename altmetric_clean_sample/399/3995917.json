While previous studies have examined signals involved in the induction of FAT\/CD36 translocation to sarcolemmal membranes, to date the signaling events responsible for FAT\/CD36 accumulation on mitochondrial membranes have not been investigated. In the current study muscle contraction rapidly increased FAT\/CD36 on plasma membranes (7.5 minutes), while in contrast, FAT\/CD36 only increased on mitochondrial membranes after 22.5 minutes of muscle contraction, a response that was exercise-intensity dependent. Considering that previous research has shown that AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) \u03b12 is not required for FAT\/CD36 translocation to the plasma membrane, we investigated whether AMPK \u03b12 signaling is necessary for mitochondrial FAT\/CD36 accumulation. Administration of 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) induced AMPK phosphorylation, and resulted in FAT\/CD36 accumulation on SS mitochondria, suggesting AMPK signaling may mediate this response. However, SS mitochondrial FAT\/CD36 increased following acute treadmill running in both wild-type (WT) and AMPK\u03b1 2 kinase dead (KD) mice. These data suggest that AMPK signaling is not required for SS mitochondrial FAT\/CD36 accumulation. The current data also implicates alternative signaling pathways that are exercise-intensity dependent, as IMF mitochondrial FAT\/CD36 content only occurred at a higher power output. Taken altogether the current data suggests that activation of AMPK signaling is sufficient but not required for exercise-induced accumulation in mitochondrial FAT\/CD36.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Cynthia Monaco","Jamie Whitfield","Swati S.
