The inhibition of cholesterol absorption in the small intestine is an attractive approach to lowering plasma cholesterol, one that is addressed by drug therapy as well as dietary supplementation with plant sterols and plant sterol esters (PSEs).\nThis study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the cholesterol-lowering effects of PSE require hydrolysis to free sterols (FSs).\nMale Syrian hamsters were fed atherogenic diets (AIN-93M purified diet containing 0.12% cholesterol and 8% coconut oil) to which one of the following was added to the diet: no PSEs or ethers (control), 5% sterol stearate esters, 5% sterol palmitate esters (PEs), 5% sterol oleate esters (OEs), 5% sterol stearate ethers (STs; to mimic nonhydrolyzable PSE), or 3% FS plus 2% sunflower oil. The treatments effectively created a spectrum of PSE hydrolysis across which cholesterol metabolism could be compared. Metabolic measurements included cholesterol absorption, plasma and liver lipid concentration, and fecal neutral sterol and bile acid excretion.\nThe STs and the PEs and SEs were poorly hydrolyzed (1.69-4.12%). In contrast, OEs were 88.3% hydrolyzed. The percent hydrolysis was negatively correlated with cholesterol absorption (r = -0.85; P < 0.0001) and positively correlated with fecal cholesterol excretion (r = 0.92; P < 0.0001), suggesting that PSE hydrolysis plays a central role in the cholesterol-lowering properties of PSE.\nOur data in hamsters suggest that PSE hydrolysis and the presence of FS is necessary to induce an optimum cholesterol-lowering effect and that poorly hydrolyzed PSE may lower cholesterol through an alternative mechanism than that of competition with cholesterol for micelle incorporation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Trevor J Carden","Jiliang Hang","Patrick H Dussault","Timothy P Carr"],"doi":"10.3945\/jn.114.207662","first_seen_on":"2015-05-14T09:26:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1541-6100"],"journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1437379529,"links":["http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/13\/jn.114.207662.abstract?papetoc=","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/145\/7\/1402.short?rss=1","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/145\/7\/1402.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/13\/jn.114.207662.full.pdf","pmid":"25972524","pubdate":"2015-05-15T22:03:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Dietary Plant Sterol Esters Must Be Hydrolyzed to Reduce Intestinal Cholesterol Absorption in Hamsters","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dietary-plant-sterol-esters-hydrolyzed-reduce-intestinal-cholesterol-absorption-hamsters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5376712,"mean":6.2846964625775,"rank":2854623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1827704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5376712,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167775,"mean":9.3423060664943,"rank":96133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":55218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167775,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3262,"mean":10.243409383625,"rank":2306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3262,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":12.608541666667,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
