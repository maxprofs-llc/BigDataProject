The current study reports the long-term results of the same trial.\nPatients with single-level cervical spondylosis and radiculopathy with or without myelopathy unresponsive to nonoperative treatment were enrolled. The per protocol patient sample at 5 years included 293 patients (163 PCM, 130 ACDF). Adverse events and secondary surgical procedures are reported on the cohorts through current follow-up, which include 110 patients (68 PCM, 42 ACDF) at 7 years.\nAt 5 years postoperative, all patient-reported outcomes-neck and arm pain visual analogue scale score, neck disability index, and general health (36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical and mental component scores: physical component summary, mental component summary)-were significantly improved from baselines in both groups, and mean scores were significantly better in the PCM group for neck disability index (P = 0.001), neck pain (P = 0.002), general health (Pphysical component summary= 0.014; Pmental component summary= 0.004), and patient satisfaction (P = 0.005). PCM patients trended toward fewer 2- to 7-year device-related serious adverse events (1\/214, 0.5% PCM; 2\/190, 1.1% ACDF) and secondary surgical procedures (7\/211, 3.3% PCM; 14\/290, 7.6% ACDF). Adjacent-level degeneration was radiographically more frequent after ACDF (33.1% PCM, 50.9% ACDF; P = 0.006) and was the primary indication for the increase in late-term secondary surgical procedures after ACDF.\nThe long-term results show good clinical outcomes after ACDF and PCM arthroplasty. PCM patients showed greater improvement in neck disability index and neck pain scores with a lower rate of radiographical adjacent-level degeneration and a trend toward fewer secondary surgical procedures. These data support PCM arthroplasty to be a viable and sustainable alternative to ACDF.\n1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Phillips, Frank M","Geisler, Fred H","Gilder, Kye M","Reah, Christopher","Howell, Kelli M","McAfee, Paul C"],"doi":"10.1097\/brs.0000000000000869","first_seen_on":"2015-05-14T20:30:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1528-1159","0362-2436"],"issue":"10","journal":"Spine","last_mentioned_on":1432352534,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Abstract\/2015\/05150\/Long_term_Outcomes_of_the_US_FDA_IDE_Prospective,.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/2015\/05150\/Long_term_Outcomes_of_the_US_FDA_IDE_Prospective,.3.pdf","pmid":"25955086","pubdate":"2015-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"674","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Long-term Outcomes of the US FDA IDE Prospective, Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Comparing PCM Cervical Disc Arthroplasty With Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-outcomes-fda-ide-prospective-randomized-controlled-clinical-trial-comparing-pcm-cervical-di-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5133432,"mean":6.0721600422813,"rank":3390244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1528488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5133432,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164183,"mean":9.2624871788626,"rank":110625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":45858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164183,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3729,"mean":4.6767339055794,"rank":2091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3729,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":4.9233103448276,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
