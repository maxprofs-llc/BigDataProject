Therefore, the aim of this post-authorization safety study (PASS) was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Zolafren in patients with bipolar disorder (BD).\nAdverse events (AEs) associated with the use of Zolafren were recorded in a PASS, in an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter observational study involving 20,698 outpatients with BD.\nZolafren was used in both monotherapy (82.8%) and polytherapy (17.2%) at a mean dose of 12.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2\u00a0mg. The most commonly used formulation was coated tablets (70.9%). Orally dissolving tablets (19.7%) and hard capsules (9.4%) were less commonly used. During a period of 171\u00a0\u00b1\u00a047\u00a0days of exposure to Zolafren, 5883 AEs were reported in 2138 patients (10.3% of the study population). None of the reported AEs were severe. Zolafren-associated AEs were the reason for discontinuation in 43\u00a0patients and the reason for dose reduction in a further 762\u00a0patients. The most common AE was weight gain (by 1.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3\u00a0kg) which was considered unrelated to the dose of Zolafren. During follow-up, the percentage of patients with very good tolerance with Zolafren increased from 44.4% to 59.8%. The percentage of patients who had confidence in Zolafren also increased.\nThe results of this PASS support the safety of Zolafren use and indicate a high tolerance in patients treated for BD.\nAdamed Sp. z o.o., Czosn\u00f3w, Poland.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f6100068d9","authors":["Jerzy Chudek","Magdalena Olszanecka-Glinianowicz","Agnieszka Almgren-Rachtan","Tomasz Gabryelewicz","Chudek, Jerzy","Olszanecka-Glinianowicz, Magdalena","Almgren-Rachtan, Agnieszka","Gabryelewicz, Tomasz"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12325-015-0210-8","first_seen_on":"2015-05-15T11:31:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1865-8652","0741-238X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Advances in Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1462270717,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12325-015-0210-8","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25975817?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12325-015-0210-8.pdf","pmid":"25975817","pubdate":"2015-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Healthcare","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Evaluation of the Safety Profile of Zolafren\u00ae, a Generic Olanzapine Formulation, in Patients with Bipolar Disorder: A Post-Authorization Safety Study","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-safety-profile-zolafrensupsup-generic-olanzapine-formulation-patients-bipolar-disorder-po"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":3956090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2146086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208922,"mean":8.6179047678309,"rank":114001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":73989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208922,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":711,"mean":4.4707690140845,"rank":285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":711,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.1795454545455,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
