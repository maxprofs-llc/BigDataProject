The multinuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H, (2)H, (7)Li, (13)C, (15)N and (31)P) study of the species formed in the monolithiation of N-(tert-butyl)-P,P-diphenyl-N'-(quinolin-8-yl)phosphinimidic amide with n-BuLi in THF showed that proton abstraction occurred exclusively and quantitatively at the NH. The combination of the NMR results with a DFT study made it possible to describe the structure of the N-lithiated species as a dimer consisting of an eight-membered ring showing two lithium ions triply coordinated to nitrogen atoms corresponding to the deprotonated amine and aminoquinoline moieties of different monomers. The formation of a polymer featuring the same coordination mode couldn't be excluded. In addition, optimized conditions for the efficient derivatization of via ortho-lithiation were realised. The reaction of with 2.4 equiv. of t-BuLi in THF in the temperature range of -80 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C for 3 h afforded a N,Cortho-dilithiated species that was trapped with a series of electrophiles leading to new functionalized ortho derivatives of in good yields.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Nerea Fern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1ez","Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez","Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Iglesias","Fernando Lopez-Ortiz","Nerea Fern\u00e1ndez S\u00e1ez","Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez","Fernando L\u00f3pez Ortiz"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5dt01392e","endpage":"11513","first_seen_on":"2015-05-15T11:39:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"25","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1431689914,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C5DT01392E"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/dt\/c5dt01392e","pmid":"26030882","pubdate":"2015-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"11504","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Derivatization of (quinolin-8-yl)phosphinimidic amides via ortho-lithiation revisited","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/derivatization-quinolin8ylphosphinimidic-amides-via-ortholithiation-revisited"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5099132,"mean":6.0427967663529,"rank":4241415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5099132,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163924,"mean":9.2574791456966,"rank":136057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163924,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8984,"mean":0.62773572303239,"rank":2470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8984,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":592,"mean":0.4844331641286,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":592,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/status\/599177043650084864","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3999033],"posted_on":"2015-05-15T11:38:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"599177043650084864"}]}}
