Strategies aimed at modulating GVHD, while maintaining the GVT effect, are needed to improve the cure rate of transplant. Given the emerging role of JAK signaling in lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative diseases and its established function at dictating T cell differentiation, we postulated that JAKs might be potential therapeutic targets through a pharmacological approach.\nWe examined the effect of JAK1\/JAK2 modulation by ruxolitinib in a mouse model of fully MHC mismatched bone marrow transplant comprising in-vivo tumor inoculation.\nJAK1\/JAK2 inhibition by ruxolitinib improved both overall survival (p=0.03) and acute GVHD pathological score at target organs (p\u22640.001) of treated mice. In addition, treatment with ruxolitinib was associated with a preserved GVT effect, as evidenced by reduction of tumor burden (p=0.001) and increase of survival time (p=0.01). JAK1\/JAK2 inhibition did not impair the in vivo acquisition of donor T cell alloreactivity; this observation may account at least in part to the preserved GVT effect. Rather, JAK1\/JAK2 inhibition of GVHD was associated with the modulation of chemokine receptor expression, which may have been one factor in the reduced infiltration of donor T cells in GVHD target organs.\nThese data provide further evidence that JAK inhibition represents a new and potentially clinically relevant approach to GVHD prevention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Cristiana Carniti","Silvia Gimondi","Antonio Vendramin","Camilla Recordati","Davide Confalonieri","Anisa Bermema","Paolo Corradini","Jacopo Mariotti"],"doi":"10.1158\/1078-0432.ccr-14-2758","first_seen_on":"2015-05-15T13:03:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-3265","1078-0432"],"journal":"Clinical Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1465989761,"links":["http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/14\/1078-0432.CCR-14-2758.abstract?papetoc=","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25977345?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25977345?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25977345?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/21\/16\/3740.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/14\/1078-0432.CCR-14-2758.full.pdf","pmid":"25977345","pubdate":"2015-05-16T22:01:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Pharmacologic Inhibition of JAK1\/JAK2 Signaling Reduces Experimental Murine Acute GVHD While Preserving GVT Effects","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacologic-inhibition-jak1jak2-signaling-reduces-experimental-murine-acute-gvhd-while-preserving"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7902020,"mean":6.6891515940364,"rank":1530202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6365990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7902020,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210049,"mean":8.6813300293267,"rank":50227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":159545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210049,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5277,"mean":5.6996520090978,"rank":986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":4284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5277,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230,"mean":4.5250655021834,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
