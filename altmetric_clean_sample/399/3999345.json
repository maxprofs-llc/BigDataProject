The current sensitivity of standard color-based analyte detection limits the further use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in research and clinical diagnoses. Here, we demonstrate a novel method that uses the Raman signal as the signal-generating system of an ELISA and combines surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with silver nanoparticles aggregation for ultrasensitive analyte detection. The enzyme label of the ELISA controls the dissolution of Raman reporter-labelled silver nanoparticles through hydrogen peroxide and generates a strong Raman signal when the analyte is present. Using this assay, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and the adrenal stimulant Ractopamine (Rac) were detected in whole serum and urine at the ultralow concentrations of 10-9 ng\/ml and 10-6 ng\/ml, respectively. The methodology proposed here could potentially be applied to other molecules detection as well as PSA and Rac.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Jiajie Liang"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b01011","first_seen_on":"2015-05-15T13:46:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6882"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1432592186,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b01011?hootPostID=33b31898b0bc3c9e6c94d30e8ad40ded&"],"pmid":"25928837","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Aggregated Silver Nanoparticles Based Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Ultrasensitive Detection of Protein Biomarkers and Small Molecules","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aggregated-silver-nanoparticles-based-surfaceenhanced-raman-scattering-enzymelinked-immunosorbent-as-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6288446,"mean":5.9490497208785,"rank":2278167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3997637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6288446,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164831,"mean":9.4507426196689,"rank":66791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":97697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164831,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5824,"mean":3.1398821913103,"rank":1609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":4204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5824,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":2.975064516129,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
