In vitro the complexes exhibited higher anticancer activity than the free ligand OG against the tested cancer cell lines. Among the tested cell lines, HepG2 is the most sensitive to the complexes. Complex can trigger DNA damage in HepG2 cells, resulting in cell cycle arrest in the S phase and leading to cell apoptosis. The S phase cell-cycle arrest is caused via the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated)-Chk2-Cdc25A pathway. Chk2 is phosphorylated and activated in an ATM-dependent manner. It, in turn, phosphorylates Cdc25A phosphatise on serine124, causing the inactivation of Cdc25A in ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation. The cyclin-Cdk complexes of the S phase could also be inhibited by limited supply of cyclins A and E. This irreversible cell cycle arrest process ultimately induces mitochondria-involved apoptotic cell death via the activation of Bcl-2 protein. Complex effectively inhibited tumour growth in the BEL-7402 xenograft mouse model and exhibited higher safety in vivo than cisplatin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Zhen-Feng Chen","Jian-Hua Wei","Jiao-Lan Qin","Yan-Cheng Liu","Zhu-Quan Li","Taj-Malook Khan","Meng Wang","Yan-Hua Jiang","Wen-Ying Shen","Hong Liang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5dt00926j","endpage":"11419","first_seen_on":"2015-05-13T15:10:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"25","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1431529775,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2015\/DT\/C5DT00926J"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2015\/dt\/c5dt00926j","pmid":"26017376","pubdate":"2015-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"11408","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Water-soluble oxoglaucine-Y(III), Dy(III) complexes: In vitro and in vivo anticancer activity by triggering DNA damage, leading to S phase arrest and apoptosis","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/watersoluble-oxoglaucineyiii-dyiii-complexes-vitro-vivo-anticancer-activities-triggering-dna-damage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5094627,"mean":6.0370384043911,"rank":4237705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5094627,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162833,"mean":9.2799754102389,"rank":135321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162833,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8979,"mean":0.62764535531299,"rank":2470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8979,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":589,"mean":0.48562925170068,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":589,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
