The integral optic density (IOD), representing the expression level of BAP31 in each tissue sample was calculated using Image-Pro Plus. Immunohistochemical analysis of BAP31 protein levels in 74 paired HCC tissue and peritumoral non-cancerous tissues showed that BAP31 proteins was significantly higher in HCC tumor tissues (P=0.025). Prognostic value of BAP31 in HCC was evaluated in 234 cases of training cohort and 63 cases of validation cohort. The expression level of BAP31 was significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) in both training and validation cohort. The lower the level of BAP31 expression in HCC tissue, the poorer prognosis was observed. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the expression level of BAP31 in HCC was an independent prognostic factor for OS in both training cohort and validation cohort.\nBAP31 expression is an independent prognostic factor for OS of postoperative HCC, and low expression levels of BAP31 in HCC may indicate poor outcome of HCC patient after surgical resection.
