The surface is integrated to calculate time-dependent volume changes during respiration.\nThe method provides a useful means of continuously measuring volume changes during respiration with high spatial and temporal resolution. The system was tested by comparison with pneumotachometry equipment and a clear periodic signal, of a frequency corresponding to the reference data, was observed.\nThe approach is unique in performing breathing monitoring (with potential diagnostic capability) for unconstrained patients in virtually any lighting conditions (including darkness during sleep) and in a non-contact, unobtrusive (i.e. using imperceptible light) fashion.
