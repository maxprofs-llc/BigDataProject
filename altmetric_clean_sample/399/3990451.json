This article reviews the development of the country's child and adolescent psychiatry services through the years, in the background of other developments within the country's education, social and legal services. Research and other available data on the prevalence of psychiatric problems among children and adolescents in Singapore are summarized, although there has been no nation-wide epidemiological study done. One of the most recent developments has been the establishment of a community mental health service, which works collaboratively with schools and community partners. Some challenges are also discussed especially in the area of child and adolescent psychiatry training. Possible future directions include providing mental heath care for preschool children as well as epidemiological studies to identify disease prevalence and mental health needs among children and adolescents in Singapore.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007f7","authors":["Choon G Lim","Say H Ong","Chee H Chin","Daniel SS Fung"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13034-015-0037-8","first_seen_on":"2015-05-13T00:14:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1753-2000"],"journal":"Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health","last_mentioned_on":1433256689,"links":["http:\/\/www.capmh.com\/content\/9\/1\/7","http:\/\/www.capmh.com\/content\/9\/1\/7\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.capmh.com\/content\/pdf\/s13034-015-0037-8.pdf","pmid":"25972918","pubdate":"2015-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Child and adolescent psychiatry services in Singapore","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/child-adolescent-psychiatry-services-singapore"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5180722,"mean":6.1095284115883,"rank":2559534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2465775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5180722,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164341,"mean":9.2827859437752,"rank":86348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":70985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164341,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214,"mean":3.5339248826291,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.1,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
