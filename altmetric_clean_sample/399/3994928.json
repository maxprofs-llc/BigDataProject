This includes both elective endoscopic procedures, such as screening colonoscopies and variceal banding, as well as the acutely bleeding cirrhotic patient. Peri-procedural management and standards of care for acute gastrointestinal hemorrhaging of cirrhotic patients will be emphasized. This article will focus on the plethora of data available to highlight the benefits of endoscopic intervention in the care of patients with liver disease and outline the areas of future emphasis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d1","authors":["Jennifer L Horsley-Silva","Hugo E Vargas","Horsley-Silva, Jennifer L","Vargas, Hugo E"],"doi":"10.1586\/17474124.2015.1044978","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2015-05-14T03:17:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1747-4124","1747-4132"],"journal":"Expert Review of Gastroenterology and Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1458817949,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/17474124.2015.1044978?ai=9b1e&mi=4ca1o4&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25967459?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25967459?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1586\/17474124.2015.1044978"],"pmid":"25967459","pubdate":"2015-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Informa Healthcare","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Gastrointestinal endoscopy in the cirrhotic patient","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gastrointestinal-endoscopy-cirrhotic-patient"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7863012,"mean":6.6583743937223,"rank":5682785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1900110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7863012,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209376,"mean":8.6602853635822,"rank":135643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":61194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209376,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":476,"mean":1.6205347368421,"rank":183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":476,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.0178571428571,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ERJournals\/status\/598688391371206656","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3994928],"posted_on":"2015-05-14T03:16:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Expert Reviews","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/page\/ExpertReviews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000496751182\/2258702d67dd42cedd317fb79fc5212a_normal.jpeg","description":"Expert Reviews is a leading series of 16 journals providing commentary and analysis on modern healthcare","id_on_source":"ERJournals","tweeter_id":"1886949961","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1286},"tweet_id":"598688391371206656"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/712947239014916100","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[3994928],"posted_on":"2016-03-24T10:20:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
