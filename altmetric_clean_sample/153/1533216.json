We have developed a five-step data pipeline to extract quantitative data on segmentation gene expression from confocal images of gene expression patterns in Drosophila. This protocol describes the preparation of Drosophila embryos for imaging by confocal microscopy. Embryos are collected at the appropriate developmental stage and fixed. They are then stained with both primary antibodies and secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorophores to reveal the segmentation gene expression patterns.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f3d","doi":"10.1101\/pdb.prot075093","first_seen_on":"2013-06-05T10:33:31+00:00","issns":["1559-6095"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cold Spring Harbor Protocols","last_mentioned_on":1370428401,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23734021?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23734021","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Preparation of Drosophila embryos for quantitative imaging of gene expression.","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preparation-drosophila-embryos-quantitative-imaging-gene-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":2898685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85556,"mean":7.0446950850332,"rank":67507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85556,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254,"mean":2.2993438735178,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fly_papers\/statuses\/342227636564680704","license":"public","citation_ids":[1533216],"posted_on":"2013-06-05T10:33:21+00:00","author":{"name":"flypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3298285242\/dc1d0402d707fe3606f9d653cd85fe6d_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Drosophila papers in #PubMed\/#arXiv\/#bioRxiv\/#PeerJ\/#F1000.
