Twelve right-handed TD children and twelve gender-matched children with DCD and probable DCD produce a motor switching task in which they have (1) to synchronize with the beat of an auditory metronome to produce bimanual symmetrical tapping and (2) to selectively inhibit their left finger's tapping while continuing their right finger's tapping and conversely. We assess (1) the development of the capacity to inhibit the stopping finger (number of supplementary taps after the stopping instruction) and (2) the development of the capacity to maintain the continuing finger (changes in the mean tempo and its variability for the continuing finger's tapping) and (3) the evolution of performance through trials. Results indicate that (1) TD children present an age-related increase in the capacity to inhibit and to maintain the left finger's tapping, (2) DCD exhibits persistent difficulties to inhibit the left finger's tapping, and (3) both groups improve their capacity to inhibit the left finger's movements through trials. In conclusion, the lateralized switching task provides a simple and fine tool to reveal differences in selective inhibition of symmetric movements in TD children and children with DCD. More theoretically, the specific improvement in selective inhibition of the left finger suggests a progressive development of inter-hemispheric communication during typical development that is absent or delayed in children with DCD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003464","authors":["Jessica Tallet","Jean-Michel Albaret","J\u00e9r\u00f4me Barral"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ridd.2013.05.020","endpage":"2532","first_seen_on":"2013-06-07T14:03:53+00:00","issns":["08914222"],"issue":"9","journal":"Research in Developmental Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1370600489,"links":["http:\/\/rss.sciencedirect.com\/action\/redirectFile?&zone=main&currentActivity=feed&usageType=outward&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0891422213002047%26_version%3D1%26md5%3De4d2429b210708b31dfbe51eda361a92"],"pmid":"23751298","pubdate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"2523","title":"Developmental changes in lateralized inhibition of symmetric movements in children with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developmental-changes-lateralized-inhibition-symmetric-movements-children-without-developmental-coor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":2901835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85324,"mean":7.0659309213227,"rank":67446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85324,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":868,"mean":2.3796585928489,"rank":673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":868,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.6565217391304,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
