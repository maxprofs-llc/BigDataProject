We determined rates and correlates of separation among 469 serodiscordant couples in Nairobi and found that 113 (24 %) separated during 2 years of follow-up. Couples with a female HIV-1 infected partner (F+M-) and no income were more likely to separate than M+F- couples without income (HR = 5.0; 95 % CI 1.1-25.0), and F+M- and M+F- couples with income (HR = 2.4; 95 % CI 1.3-4.5 and HR = 2.3; 95 % CI 1.2-4.8, respectively). High separation rates may be important for couple support services and for conducting discordant couple studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","doi":"10.1007\/s10461-013-0529-6","first_seen_on":"2013-06-06T22:05:56+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1573-3254"],"journal":"AIDS & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1372408534,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23728523"],"pmid":"23728523","pubdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome","behavioralsciences"],"title":"High Rates of Relationship Dissolution Among Heterosexual HIV-Serodiscordant Couples in Kenya.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-rates-relationship-dissolution-among-heterosexual-hivserodiscordant-couples-kenya"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628118,"mean":4.9440792284301,"rank":1986581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1610441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628118,"percentile":44},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85271,"mean":7.1049042570659,"rank":43572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":40605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85271,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":943,"mean":3.2881825902335,"rank":624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":943,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.7586206896552,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
