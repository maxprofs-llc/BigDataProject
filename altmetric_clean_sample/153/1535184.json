In prior research demonstrating automatic inhibition in response to unconsciously processed stimuli, the unconscious stimuli had previously been consciously associated with an inhibitory response within the context of the experiment, and participants had consciously formed a goal to activate inhibition processes when presented with the stimuli (because task instructions required participants to engage in inhibition when the stimuli occurred). Therefore, prior work suggests that some amount of conscious thought and intentionality are required for inhibitory control. In the present research, we recorded event-related potentials during two go\/no-go experiments in which participants were subliminally primed with general action\/inaction concepts that had never been consciously associated with task-specific responses. We provide the first demonstration that inhibitory control processes can be modulated completely unconsciously and unintentionally.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002589","authors":["Justin Hepler","Dolores Albarracin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cognition.2013.04.012","endpage":"279","first_seen_on":"2013-06-06T03:19:42+00:00","issns":["00100277"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1386100664,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0010027713000930"],"pmid":"23747649","pubdate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"271","title":"Complete unconscious control: Using (in)action primes to demonstrate completely unconscious activation of inhibitory control mechanisms","type":"article","volume":"128","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-unconscious-control-using-inaction-primes-demonstrate-completely-unconscious-activation-inh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":77.87,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":77.87},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229233,"mean":5.9658211095702,"rank":70753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":6158632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229233,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99352,"mean":7.4166895149521,"rank":1567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":97785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99352,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1358,"mean":11.301314664702,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1358,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":4.4789473684211,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
