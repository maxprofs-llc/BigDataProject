Here we compare the structure, expression, and phylogeny of the beta (\u03b2)-keratins in two crocodilian genomes and two avian genomes to gain a better understanding of the evolutionary origin of the feather \u03b2-keratins. Unlike squamates such as the green anole with 40 \u03b2-keratins in its genome, the chicken and zebra finch genomes have over 100 \u03b2-keratin genes in their genomes, while the American alligator has 20 \u03b2-keratin genes, and the saltwater crocodile has 21 \u03b2-keratin genes. The crocodilian \u03b2-keratins are similar to those of birds and these structural proteins have a central filament domain and N- and C-termini, which contribute to the matrix material between the twisted \u03b2-sheets, which form the 2-3 nm filament. Overall the expression of alligator \u03b2-keratin genes in the integument increases during development. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that a crocodilian \u03b2-keratin clade forms a monophyletic group with the avian scale and feather \u03b2-keratins, suggesting that avian scale and feather \u03b2-keratins along with a subset of crocodilian \u03b2-keratins evolved from a common ancestral gene\/s. Overall, our analyses support the view that the epidermal appendages of basal archosaurs used a diverse array of \u03b2-keratins, which evolved into crocodilian and avian specific clades. In birds, the scale and feather subfamilies appear to have evolved independently in the avian lineage from a subset of archosaurian claw \u03b2-keratins. The expansion of the avian specific feather \u03b2-keratin genes accompanied the diversification of birds and the evolution of feathers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c7a","authors":["Greenwold, Matthew J.","Sawyer, Roger H.","Matthew J.
