Optomechanics with superfluids has been proposed as a path towards ultra-low optical- and mechanical-dissipation. However, there have been no optomechanics experiments reported with non-solid phases of matter. Direct liquid immersion of optomechanics experiments is challenging, as the acoustic energy simply leaks out to the higher-impedance liquid surrounding the device. Here we confine liquids within hollow resonators to circumvent this issue and to enable optical excitation of mechanical whispering-gallery modes at frequencies ranging from 2 to 11,000 MHz. Our device enables optomechanical investigation with liquids, while light is conventionally coupled from the outer dry side of the capillary, and liquids are provided by means of a standard microfluidic inlet.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Gaurav Bahl","Kyu Hyun Kim","Wonsuk Lee","Jing Liu","Xudong Fan","Tal Carmon"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms2994","first_seen_on":"2013-06-07T10:06:57+00:00","issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1371830440,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1038\/ncomms2994"],"pmid":"23744103","pubdate":"2013-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Brillouin cavity optomechanics with microfluidic devices","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brillouin-cavity-optomechanics-microfluidic-devices"},"altmetric_score":{"score":59.618,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":59.618},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9408620385482,"rank":39987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":3645121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85746,"mean":7.0146134934981,"rank":1821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":83925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85746,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5285,"mean":25.471107494322,"rank":662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5285,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":22.511096774194,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
