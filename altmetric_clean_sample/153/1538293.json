Recent case reports describe lipid infusion for the successful treatment of refractory cardiac arrest caused by parenteral administration of local anesthetics, but clinical evidence has been lacking for lipid's antidotal efficacy on toxicity caused by ingested medications. A 17-year-old girl developed seizure activity and cardiovascular collapse after intentional ingestion of up to 7.95 g of bupropion and 4 g of lamotrigine. Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 70 minutes was unsuccessful in restoring sustained circulation. A 100-mL intravenous bolus of 20% lipid emulsion was then administered, and after 1 minute an effective sustained pulse was observed. The patient subsequently manifested significant acute lung injury but had rapid improvement in cardiovascular status and recovered, with near-normal neurologic function. Serum bupropion levels before and after lipid infusion paralleled triglyceride levels. This patient developed cardiovascular collapse because of intentional, oral overdose of bupropion and lamotrigine that was initially refractory to standard resuscitation measures. An infusion of lipid emulsion was followed rapidly by restoration of effective circulation. Toxicologic studies are consistent with the lipid sink theory of antidotal efficacy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005724","authors":["Sirianni AJ","Osterhoudt KC","Calello DP","Muller AA","Waterhouse MR","Goodkin MB","Weinberg GL","Henretig FM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.annemergmed.2007.06.004","endpage":"415.e1","first_seen_on":"2013-06-07T10:29:13+00:00","issns":["0196-0644","01960644"],"issue":"4","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1478267964,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17766009","http:\/\/www.annemergmed.com\/article\/S0196-0644(07)00717-2\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.annemergmed.2007.06.004","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/17766009\/@NBHochfelden\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/17766009\/"],"pmid":"17766009","pubdate":"2007-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"412","subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Use of lipid emulsion in the resuscitation of a patient with prolonged cardiovascular collapse after overdose of bupropion and lamotrigine.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/response-lipid-emulsion-resuscitation-patient-prolonged-cardiovascular-collapse-after-overdose-bupro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.7,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":420109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7224338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121470,"mean":6.7638551729249,"rank":7881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":113576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121470,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3189,"mean":13.247651819322,"rank":449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":2740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3189,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":24.071684210526,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":18,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
