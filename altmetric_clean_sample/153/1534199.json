This has been termed a \"paradox,\" as Blacks suffer greater exposure to social stressors, a risk factor for depression. Subgroup analyses can inform hypotheses to explain this paradox. For example, it has been suggested that selection bias in household samples undercounts depression in Blacks; if selection is driving the paradox, Black-White differences should be most pronounced among young men with low education.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003562","doi":"10.1007\/s00127-013-0718-7","first_seen_on":"2013-06-05T17:12:20+00:00","issns":["1433-9285"],"journal":"Social Psychiatry & Psychiatric Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1370452237,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23732705"],"pmid":"23732705","pubdate":"2013-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["epidemiology","socialsciences","psychiatry"],"title":"Racial differences in depression in the United States: how do subgroup analyses inform a paradox?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/racial-differences-depression-united-states-subgroup-analyses-inform-paradox"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3078070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":957263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89725,"mean":7.2557071686507,"rank":61873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89725,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":694,"mean":5.1225916305916,"rank":531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":694,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":3.4622777777778,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
