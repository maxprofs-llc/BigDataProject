It also investigates the sources and effects of P level increase, including the underlying mechanisms and potential strategies in preventing its elevation during ovarian stimulation. The origin of production of P in the early follicular phase is adrenal which shifts toward the ovaries prior to the ovulation. Several factors contribute to the etiology of P level increase including the number of multiple follicles, the overdose of gonadotropins and poor ovarian response. Nowadays, the influence of the preovulatory P rise on IVF outcome remains controversial. Several authors have failed to demonstrate any negative impact, while others reported a detrimental effect associated with the rise of P. It seems that P rise (\u2264 1.5 ng\/ml or 4.77 nmol\/l) may have deleterious effects on endometrial receptivity, namely, accelerating the endometrial maturation process that subsequently narrows the time-frame for implantation and thus decreases pregnancy rates. To prevent a P rise, it might be preferable to use milder stimulation protocols, earlier trigger of ovulation, cryopreservation of all embryos and transfer in the natural cycle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003cff","authors":["Miro Kasum","Branko Radakovic","Velimir Simunic","Slavko Ore\u0161kovic"],"doi":"10.3109\/09513590.2013.798280","endpage":"5","first_seen_on":"2013-06-08T03:15:57+00:00","issns":["0951-3590","1473-0766"],"journal":"Gynecological Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1370665212,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/09513590.2013.798280","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/09513590.2013.798280?ai=1lij&mi=3gfofr&af=R&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed&","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/09513590.2013.798280?ai=1lij&mi=3hg502&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&"],"pmid":"23745784","pubdate":"2013-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["endocrinology","gynecology"],"title":"Preovulatory progesterone rise during ovarian stimulation for IVF.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preovulatory-progesterone-rise-during-ovarian-stimulation-ivf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2309577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1582394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89566,"mean":7.244520270195,"rank":45257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":30871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89566,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":471,"mean":1.5999659574468,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":471,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.86086956521739,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1,"HR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IHC_AntiAging\/statuses\/343204699148783616","license":"public","citation_ids":[1539931],"posted_on":"2013-06-08T03:15:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Anti-Aging Research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1867332936\/2012-128x128icons-IHC_AntiAging_normal.png","id_on_source":"IHC_AntiAging","tweeter_id":"210901686","followers":159},"tweet_id":"343204699148783616"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IHC_Obstetrics\/statuses\/343220893792747521","license":"public","citation_ids":[1539931],"posted_on":"2013-06-08T04:20:12+00:00","author":{"name":"T&F Obs and Gyn","url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/obsgyntandf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/668777730255753216\/g1_Tu0lK_normal.png","description":"Keep up to date with all the latest news and content from Taylor & Francis Obstetrics and Gynecology journals.","id_on_source":"IHC_Obstetrics","tweeter_id":"210899760","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3403},"tweet_id":"343220893792747521"}]}}
