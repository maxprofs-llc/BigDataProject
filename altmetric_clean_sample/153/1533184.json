Furthermore, there is still significant variation in the conduct of this complex perioperative technique. This variation in deep hypothermic circulatory arrest practice has not been adequately characterized and may offer multiple opportunities for outcome enhancement. The hypothesis of this study was that the current practice of adult deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in China has significant variations that might offer therapeutic opportunities for reduction of procedural risk.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67b3cf058f6100097b8","authors":["Augoustides JG","Patel P","Ghadimi R","Choi J","Yue Y","Silvay G"],"first_seen_on":"2013-06-05T10:29:11+00:00","issns":["2037-0504"],"issue":"1","journal":"HSR Proceedings in Intensive Care & Cardiovascular Anesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1370428143,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23734286?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3670723","pmid":"23734286","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Current conduct of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in China.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-conduct-deep-hypothermic-circulatory-arrest-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632750,"mean":4.9231796234803,"rank":2897989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632750,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85580,"mean":7.0395808317463,"rank":67479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85580,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.359375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
