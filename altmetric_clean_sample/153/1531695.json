DCs comprise a heterogeneous mixture of subsets that are located throughout the body and possess distinct and specialized functions. Although numerous defined precursors from the bone marrow and spleen have been identified, emerging data in the field suggests many alternative routes of DC differentiation from precursors with multilineage potential. Here, we discuss how the combinatorial expression of transcription factors can promote one DC lineage over another as well as the integration of cytokine signaling in this process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5183cf058f610003830","authors":["Moore, Amanda J."],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/949513","first_seen_on":"2013-06-04T19:31:21+00:00","issns":["1687-9104"],"journal":"Advances in Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1371664593,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ah\/2013\/949513\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ah\/2013\/949513.pdf","pmid":"23476654","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Dendritic Cell Development: A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Story","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dendritic-cell-development-chooseyourownadventure-story"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":964811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89511,"mean":7.2680265445203,"rank":61854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89511,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":1.3406101694915,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":8.44,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
