The antibacterial activity was examined for thirteen plant species from several genera that were identified as a result of TRAMIL ethnopharmacological surveys or were reported in ethnobotanical accounts from Puerto Rico. The aim of this study was to validate the traditional use of these plant species for the treatment of bacterial infections, such as conjunctivitis, fever, otitis media and furuncles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b0","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6882-13-126","first_seen_on":"2013-06-04T06:06:33+00:00","issns":["1472-6882"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1375077452,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6882\/13\/126\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6882-13-126.pdf","pmid":"23731467","pubdate":"2013-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"126","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"A screening for antimicrobial activities of Caribbean herbal remedies","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/screening-antimicrobial-activities-caribbean-herbal-remedies-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820613,"mean":6.631918187471,"rank":1547202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6266358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820613,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122022,"mean":6.8087916670083,"rank":24452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":97428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122022,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1944,"mean":6.3826392177046,"rank":449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1944,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":5.1524827586207,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
