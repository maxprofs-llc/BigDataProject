Unfortunately, however, none of the first-generation CDK inhibitors has yielded the expected efficacy to be successfully translated to the clinic mostly because, by targeting the very conserved kinase ATP-binding site resulted to be poorly specific and quite toxic.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c5","authors":["Agnese Abate","Antonio Giordano","Francesca Pentimalli","Esposito Luca"],"doi":"10.1517\/13543784.2013.798641","endpage":"12","first_seen_on":"2013-06-06T03:19:08+00:00","issns":["1354-3784","1744-7658"],"journal":"Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1370488742,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/13543784.2013.798641","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/13543784.2013.798641?ai=ry&mi=3j7h3l&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&"],"pmid":"23735075","pubdate":"2013-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"ATP-noncompetitive CDK inhibitors for cancer therapy: an overview.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atpnoncompetitive-cdk-inhibitors-cancer-therapy-overview-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4202697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94039,"mean":7.3983198281548,"rank":77785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94039,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":630,"mean":2.0657138314785,"rank":483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":630,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.4626923076923,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
