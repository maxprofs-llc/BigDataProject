Type 1 diabetes is considered as an autoimmune disease with unknown aetiology. Here we propose that the immune reaction may be initiated by food-derived mechanisms. The incidence of diabetes parallels an increased consumption of pasta, white bread, meat, cheese, low-fat milk, exotic fruits, soda, and snacks. Simultaneously, the consumption of potatoes, butter, high-fat milk, and domestic fruit has decreased. Three categories of food related reaction mechanisms are discussed against the following items (1) proteins from wheat, meat, and milk, (2) fat from processed food, and (3) exotic fruits. The current food consumption is suggested to initiate a pro-inflammatory reaction in the intestine and thereby reduce the intestinal barrier function. This may influence tolerance development and thus pave the way for an autoimmune attack on pancreatic beta cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008126","authors":["Landin-Olsson, Mona","Hillman, Magnus","Erlanson-Albertsson, Charlotte"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mehy.2013.03.046","first_seen_on":"2013-06-06T15:00:34+00:00","issns":["0306-9877"],"journal":"Medical Hypotheses","last_mentioned_on":1375829997,"links":["http:\/\/www.medical-hypotheses.com\/article\/S0306-9877%2813%2900170-9\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.medical-hypotheses.com\/article\/S0306-9877(13)00170-9\/pdf","pmid":"23688738","pubdate":"2013-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Is type 1 diabetes a food-induced disease?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/type-1-diabetes-foodinduced-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2917271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1439496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89556,"mean":7.2954532968569,"rank":56686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":29189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89556,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1690,"mean":4.7404203670811,"rank":1137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1690,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.9539411764706,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":6,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":8,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2,"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":8,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NZ":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=571378866236266&id=532473496793470","license":"public","citation_ids":[1536206],"posted_on":"2013-06-05T18:22:34+00:00","summary":"Is type 1 diabetes a food-induced disease?
