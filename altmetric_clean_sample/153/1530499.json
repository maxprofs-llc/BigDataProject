Forty-one healthy participants were selected, ranging from 20 to 30\u00a0years of age. The US tests were conducted and interpreted by two observers (A and B) on two separate occasions (Test 1 and Test 2). Intra-observer and interobserver reproducibility and repeatability of US measurements were determined by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC[2,1] ) using a 95% confidence interval (CI). Interobserver reproducibility assessment showed 'high correlation' for Test 1 and Test 2 (ICC[2,1] \u00a0=\u00a00\u00b783, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b770-0\u00b791, and ICC[2,1] \u00a0=\u00a00\u00b779, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b761-0\u00b789, respectively). Intra-observer reproducibility assessment showed 'moderate correlation' for observer A (ICC[2,1] \u00a0=\u00a00\u00b769, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b745-0\u00b784) and for observer B (ICC[2,1] \u00a0=\u00a00\u00b765, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b739-0\u00b781). Repeatability assessment showed 'high correlation' for all tests performed (ICC[2,1] \u00a0=\u00a00\u00b786, 0\u00b780, 0\u00b774, 0\u00b779, P<0\u00b7001). In conclusion, US measurement of craniocaudal displacement of the left branch of the portal vein is a reproducible method of measuring right hemidiaphragm mobility in healthy young adults.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002573","authors":["Grams, Samantha T.","Salti\u00e9l, Rossana","Mayer, Anamaria F.","Schivinski, Camila I.
