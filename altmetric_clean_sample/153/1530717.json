However, solutions based solely on cost-effectiveness analyses may lead to biased and insufficiently justified priorities. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this paper are to 1) demonstrate how a range of equity concerns can be used to identify feasible priority setting criteria, 2) show how these criteria can be fed into a multi-criteria decision-making matrix, and 3) discuss the conditions under which this decision-making procedure should be carried out in a real-world decision-making context. METHODS: This paper draws on elements from theories of decision analysis and ethical theories of fair resource allocation. We explore six typical NTD interventions by employing a modified multi-criteria decision analysis model with predefined criteria, drawn from a priority setting guide under development by the WHO. To identify relevant evidence for the six chosen interventions, we searched the PubMed and Cochrane databases. DISCUSSION: Our in vitro multi-criteria decision analysis suggested that case management for visceral leishmaniasis should be given a higher priority than mass campaigns to prevent soil-transmitted helminthic infections. This seems to contradict current health care priorities and recommendations in the literature. We also consider procedural conditions that should be met in a contextualised decision-making process and we stress the limitations of this study exercise. CONCLUSION: By exploring how several criteria relevant to the multi-facetted characteristics of NTDs can be taken into account simultaneously, we are able to suggest how improved priority settings among NTDs can be realised.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e6","authors":["Str\u00f8mme, Elisabeth Marie","B\u00e6r\u00f8e, Kristine","Norheim, Ole Frithjof","Elisabeth Marie Str\u00f8mme","Kristine Baer\u00f8e","Ole Frithjof Norheim"],"doi":"10.1111\/dewb.12016","endpage":"141","first_seen_on":"2013-06-04T12:12:39+00:00","issns":["1471-8847","1471-8731","14718731"],"issue":"3","journal":"Developing World Bioethics","last_mentioned_on":1420070400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23724925","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dewb.12016\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/dewb.12016"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/dewb.12016\/pdf","pmid":"23724925","pubdate":"2013-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Religion And Religious Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"132","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Disease Control Priorities for Neglected Tropical Diseases: Lessons from Priority Ranking Based on the Quality of Evidence, Cost Effectiveness, Severity of Disease, Catastrophic Health Expenditures, and Loss of Productivity.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disease-control-priorities-neglected-tropical-diseases-lessons-priority-ranking-based-quality-eviden"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085712,"mean":6.894559944072,"rank":1265689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6815119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085712,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123460,"mean":6.9833760519688,"rank":20423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":102962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123460,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":3.9688057553957,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
