Most studies have focused on MYC translocations but there is little information regarding the impact of numerical alterations and protein expression. We analyzed the genetic alterations and protein expression of MYC, BCL2, BCL6, and MALT1 in 219 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. MYC rearrangement occurred as the sole abnormality (MYC single-hit) in 3% of cases, MYC and concurrent BCL2 and\/or BCL6 rearrangements (MYC double\/triple-hit) in 4%, MYC amplifications in 2% and MYC gains in 19%. MYC single-hit, MYC double\/triple-hit and MYC amplifications, but not MYC gains or other gene rearrangements, were associated with unfavorable progression-free survival and overall survival. MYC protein expression, evaluated using computerized image analysis, captured the unfavorable prognosis of MYC translocations\/amplifications and identified an additional subset of patients without gene alterations but with similar poor prognosis. Patients with tumors expressing both MYC\/BCL2 had the worst prognosis, whereas those with double-negative tumors had the best outcome. High MYC expression was associated with shorter overall survival irrespectively of the International Prognostic Index and BCL2 expression. In conclusion, MYC protein expression identifies a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with very poor prognosis independently of gene alterations and other prognostic parameters.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f6100075cb","authors":["Valera Barros, Alexandra","Alexandra Valera","Armando L\u00f3pez-Guillermo","Teresa Cardesa-Salzmann","Fina Climent","Eva Gonz\u00e1lez-Barca","Santiago Mercadal","\u00cd\u00f1igo Espinosa","Silvana Novelli","Javier Briones","Jos\u00e9 L.
