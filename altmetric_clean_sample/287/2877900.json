In this study, we determined the threshold by comparing perfusion, using ICG imaging (SPY imaging system, LifeCell Corporation), to clinical evidence of nonviability in rat abdominal perforator flaps.Abdominal flaps, based on a single perforator, were elevated and re-inset in Sprague-Dawley rats. ICG imaging and clinical assessments were conducted preoperatively, as well as 0, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively. SPY-Q software allowed standardization of the perforator's perfusion for comparison purposes. A total of 278 random percentage measurements were made from postoperative day 0 giving a mean (SE) percentage perfusion of 26.8% (1.6%) and 59.1% (1.3%), respectively, for necrosis and survival (P < 0.05). We demonstrate that ICG angiography can be readily analyzed in a perforator flap environment allowing a determination of the perfusion threshold.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a2c","authors":["Monahan J","Hwang BH","Kennedy JM","Chen W","Nguyen GK","Schooler WG","Wong AK"],"doi":"10.1097\/sap.0b013e318276da2d","endpage":"606","first_seen_on":"2014-11-12T01:36:38+00:00","issns":["0148-7043"],"issue":"5","journal":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1415756179,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Abstract\/2014\/11000\/Determination_of_a_Perfusion_Threshold_in.26.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/2014\/11000\/Determination_of_a_Perfusion_Threshold_in.26.pdf","pmid":"24625512","pubdate":"2014-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"602","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Determination of a Perfusion Threshold in Experimental Perforator Flap Surgery Using Indocyanine Green Angiography","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determination-perfusion-threshold-experimental-perforator-flap-surgery-using-indocyanine-green-angio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4198638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142405,"mean":8.8011626077921,"rank":114245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142405,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1961,"mean":1.0118602040816,"rank":1149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1961,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":0.93101265822785,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
