In this regards microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing, have received considerable interest. miRNAs repress gene expression via their ability to pair with target sequences in the 3' un-translated (3' UTR) region of the mRNA. miRNAs play a crucial role in the biogenesis and function of the cardiovascular system and are implicated as dynamic regulators of cardiac and vascular signalling and pathophysiology. Numerous miRNAs have been identified as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for CVD. In this review, we discuss the contribution of miRNAs to the regulation of CVD, their role in macro\/micro vascular (dys)function, their potential as important biomarkers for the early detection of CVD and, finally, as therapeutic targets.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb9","authors":["Gnanapragasam Arunachalam","Rohit Upadhyay","Hong Ding","Chris R Triggle"],"doi":"10.1097\/fjc.0000000000000178","first_seen_on":"2014-11-11T11:41:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-4023","0160-2446"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1434094027,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25384197?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25384197","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/Fulltext\/2015\/05000\/MicroRNA_Signature_and_Cardiovascular_Dysfunction.4.aspx"],"pmid":"25384197","pubdate":"2014-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","cardiology"],"title":"MicroRNA Signature and Cardiovascular Dysfunction","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna-signature-cardiovascular-dysfunction-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5221989,"mean":6.1572936372149,"rank":1986265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3217825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5221989,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147828,"mean":8.7548670269979,"rank":47705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":99415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147828,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1086,"mean":1.7122341013825,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1086,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.0481578947368,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
