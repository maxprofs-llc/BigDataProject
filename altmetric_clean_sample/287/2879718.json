The aim of this study was to assess the effect of ectopic expression of Oct-4 in human amniotic fluid stem cells. Materials and Methods: We developed a novel method for isolation of putative human amniotic fluid-derived multipotent stem cells (hAFSCs). These cells showing mesenchymal stem cell phenotypes (hAFMSCs) were transfected with a plasmid carrying genes for Oct-4 and the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The stably transfected cells, hAFMSCs-Oct4\/GFP, were selected by using G418 and found to express the GFP reporter gene under the control of Oct-4 promoter. Results: We found that hAFMSCs developed by our method possess very high self-renewal ability (about 78 cumulative population doublings) and multi-lineage differentiation potency. Significantly, the hAFMSCs-Oct4\/GFP cells showed enhanced expression of the 3 major pluripotency genes, Oct-4, Nanog and Sox-2, and increased colony-forming ability and growth rate compared to the parental hAFMSCs. Conclusion: We demonstrated that ectopic expression of Oct-4 gene in hAFMSCs with high self-renewal ability could upregulate Nanog and Sox-2 gene expression, enhance cell growth rate and colony forming efficiency. Therefore, the ectopic expression of Oct-4 could be a strategy to develop pluripotency in hAFMSCs for clinical applications. This article is protected by copyright.
