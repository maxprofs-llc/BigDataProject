However, protein expression within different thymic subsets, stromal and\/or lymphoid, has not been characterized due a lack of specific reagents. To address this, we generated a hybridoma (G9P3-1) secreting a monoclonal antibody (G9P3-1Mab), reactive against both human and mouse EVA1. The G9P3-1Mab was generated by immunizing Mpzl2-deficient gene-targeted mice with the extracellular domain of EVA1, followed by a conventional hybridoma fusion protocol, illustrating the feasibility of using gene-targeted mice to generate monoclonal antibodies with multiple species cross-reactivity. We confirmed expression of EVA1 on cortical and medullary epithelial cell subsets and revealed a restricted pattern of expression on CD4- CD8- double negative (DN) cell subsets, with the highest level of expression on DN3 (CD44(low)CD25(+)) thymocytes. G9P3-1MAb is a valuable reagent to study thymic T cell development and is likely useful for the analysis of pathological conditions affecting thymopoiesis, such as thymic involution caused by stress or aging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Garabatos N","Blanco J","Fandos C","Lopez E","Santamaria P","Ruiz A","Perez-Vidakovics ML","Benveniste P","Galkin O","Zu\u00f1iga-Pflucker JC","Serra P"],"doi":"10.1089\/mab.2014.0030","first_seen_on":"2014-11-10T17:11:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[""],"issue":"5","journal":"Monoclon Antib Immunodiagn Immunother","last_mentioned_on":1415639526,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25357997"],"pmid":"25357997","pubdate":"2014-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"A Monoclonal Antibody Against the Extracellular Domain of Mouse and Human Epithelial V-like Antigen 1 Reveals a Restricted Expression Pattern Among CD4- CD8- Thymocytes.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monoclonal-antibody-against-extracellular-domain-mouse-human-epithelial-vlike-antigen-1-reveals-rest"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":3982611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133572,"mean":8.9291025147676,"rank":107074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133572,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":367,"mean":2.7026885245902,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":367,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/semantic_bot\/status\/531856583211622400","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2870273],"posted_on":"2014-11-10T17:11:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Berkeley Bot","url":"http:\/\/markfarrell.ca\/creal","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/530906132680695808\/WJYpLqU8_normal.png","description":"Beep!
