Here we show that a new alkyne amino acid can be site-selectively incorporated into mammalian proteins via a known orthogonal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase\/tRNACUA pair and directs an unprecedented, palladium-mediated cross-coupling reaction-driven protein labeling on live mammalian cell surface. A comparison study with the alkyne-encoded proteins in vitro indicated that this terminal alkyne is better suited for the palladium-mediated cross-coupling reaction than the copper-catalyzed click chemistry.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006811","authors":["Nan Li"],"doi":"10.1021\/cb500649q","first_seen_on":"2014-11-12T06:02:06+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1554-8929"],"journal":"ACS Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1415772002,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/cb500649q"],"pmid":"25347611","pubdate":"2014-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","biochemistry"],"title":"A Genetically Encoded Alkyne Directs Palladium-Mediated Protein Labeling on Live Mammalian Cell Surface.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetically-encoded-alkyne-directs-palladiummediated-protein-labeling-live-mammalian-cell-surface"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4497175,"mean":4.7666293194958,"rank":3451772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":133149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4497175,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123143,"mean":7.5808630524111,"rank":90778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123143,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1022,"mean":3.6587717923604,"rank":847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1022,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":3.6799310344828,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
