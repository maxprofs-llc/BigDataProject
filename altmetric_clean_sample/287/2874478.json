Six kinds of macroporous resins were investigated in the first step and X-5 macroporous resin was selected for the enrichment of the target compounds. The recoveries of the target compounds reached 89.0, 85.9, 82.3 and 84.9% respectively after 40% ethanol elution. In the second step, the target compounds were separated by HSCCC with a two-phase solvent system composed of chloroform\/ethyl acetate\/methanol\/water (8:1:6:5, v\/v). The established method will be helpful for further characterization and utilization of Rheum tanguticum. The results demonstrate that MR coupled with HSCCC is a powerful technique for separation of bioactive compounds from natural products.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf7","authors":["Chen T","Liu YL","Chen C","Zou DL","You JM","Sun J","Li YL"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jchromb.2014.02.045","first_seen_on":"2014-11-11T11:14:46+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical & Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1415704452,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24662143?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24662143","pubdate":"2014-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Application of high-speed counter-current chromatography combined with macroporous resin for rapid enrichment and separation of three anthraquinone glycosides and one stilbene glycoside from Rheum tanguticum.","type":"article","volume":"957C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-highspeed-countercurrent-chromatography-combined-macroporous-resin-rapid-enrichment-sepa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4492191,"mean":4.7713588006591,"rank":3451782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":133279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4492191,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123549,"mean":7.5924117751806,"rank":91267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123549,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":637,"mean":1.6217924528302,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":637,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.607375,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
