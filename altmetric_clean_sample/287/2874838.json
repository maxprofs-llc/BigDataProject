A large proportion of AAA develops an intraluminal thrombus, which contributes to hypoxia, inflammation and tissue degradation. We have previously shown that patients with AAA produce clots with altered structure which is more resistant to fibrinolysis. The aim of this study was to investigate genetic polymorphisms of FXIII and fibrinogen in AAA to identify how changes to these proteins may play a role in the development of AAA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Fraser L Macrae","Hannah Lee Evans","Katherine I Bridge","Anne Johnson","D Julian A Scott","Robert A S Ari\u00ebns"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0112407","first_seen_on":"2014-11-11T12:13:09+00:00","funders":["niehs","bhf"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1415707953,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25384012?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25384012","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Common FXIII and Fibrinogen Polymorphisms in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/common-fxiii-fibrinogen-polymorphisms-abdominal-aortic-aneurysms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4492472,"mean":4.7708186478339,"rank":3450143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":133328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4492472,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123554,"mean":7.5921120005181,"rank":91146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123554,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79745,"mean":7.6595828651685,"rank":61405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79745,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2879,"mean":12.594786657401,"rank":2353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2879,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Physics and Astronomy":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/status\/532143843353710592","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2874838],"posted_on":"2014-11-11T12:12:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"532143843353710592"}]}}
