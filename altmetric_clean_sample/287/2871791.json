Gamma-glutamylethylamide (L-theanine), a natural glutamate analog in green tea, has been shown to exert strong anti-ischemic effect. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of L-theanine on neurotoxicity induced by PD-related neurotoxicants, rotenone and dieldrin in cultured human dopaminergic cell line, SH-SY5Y. Our initial experiments revealed that L-theanine (500 microM) attenuated both rotenone- and dieldrin-induced DNA fragmentation and apoptotic death in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, L-theanine partially prevented both rotenone- and dieldrin-induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) up-regulation. Both rotenone- and dieldrin-induced down-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1\/2 (ERK1\/2) phosphorylation was significantly blocked by pretreatment with L-theanine. Furthermore, pretreatment with L-theanine significantly attenuated the down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) production in SH-SY5Y cells. These results suggest that L-theanine directly provide neuroprotection against PD-related neurotoxicants and may be clinically useful for preventing PD symptoms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031b0","authors":["Cho HS","Kim S","Lee SY","Park JA","Kim SJ","Chun HS"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuro.2008.03.004","first_seen_on":"2014-11-10T23:36:09+00:00","issns":["0161-813X"],"issue":"4","journal":"NeuroToxicology","last_mentioned_on":1470074400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18452993"],"pmid":"18452993","pubdate":"2008-05-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","neurology"],"title":"Protective effect of the green tea component, L-theanine on environmental toxins-induced neuronal cell death.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protective-effect-green-tea-component-ltheanine-environmental-toxinsinduced-neuronal-cell-death"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":509917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7638532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202379,"mean":8.0376856772971,"rank":16229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":186093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202379,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":733,"mean":5.3124726775956,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":733,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.23625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
