It is not clear the reason why the frequencies of FTLD with positive family history were lower in Asia. Furthermore, these findings were not from studies focused on family history. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further studies on the family history of FTLD in Asia. This international multi-center research aims to investigate the family histories in patients with FTLD and related neurodegenerative diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and motor neuron diseases in a larger Asian cohort.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e83cf058f6100059c1","doi":"10.1017\/s1041610214000635","first_seen_on":"2014-11-11T21:01:05+00:00","issns":["1741-203X"],"issue":"12","journal":"International Psychogeriatrics","last_mentioned_on":1415631700,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?aid=9403098&fromPage=online"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S1041610214000635","pmid":"24759627","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1967","subjects":["geriatrics","psychiatry"],"title":"Family history of frontotemporal lobar degeneration in Asia \u2013 an international multi-center research","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/family-history-frontotemporal-lobar-degeneration-asia-international-multicenter-research"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4488773,"mean":4.773261823621,"rank":3449972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":132847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4488773,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123445,"mean":7.6001662292214,"rank":91287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123445,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":867,"mean":2.6179099307159,"rank":735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":867,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":5.8099411764706,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
