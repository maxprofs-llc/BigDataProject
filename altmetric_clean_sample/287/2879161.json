A large number of compounds were characterised, flavonoids and phenolic acids being the major components found in target samples, 39 compounds (flavonoids, phenolic acids, terpenoids, cyanogenic glycosides and organic acids) were identified in cherimoyas, lemons, papayas, passion-fruits and strawberries for the first time. Furthermore, all samples were systematically analysed for their total phenolic and flavonoid contents along with two radical scavenging methods (ABTS and ORAC) for antioxidant activity measurement. Target fruits presented high phenolic contents which is responsible for most of the antioxidant activity against radical reactive species (R(2)>0.80). Quantitative data showed that anthocyanins, in particular pelargonidin-3-O-hexoside (>300 mg\/100 mL), present only in strawberries were the compounds in largest amounts but are the ones which contribute less to the antioxidant activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2014.09.163","first_seen_on":"2014-11-12T08:40:34+00:00","issns":["03088146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1415781578,"links":["http:\/\/rss.sciencedirect.com\/action\/redirectFile?&zone=main&currentActivity=feed&usageType=outward&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0308814614015520%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D5a3bede20a8abbddd97f216406558dab"],"pmid":"25465990","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Identification and quantification of phenolic compounds of selected fruits from Madeira Island by HPLC-DAD\u2013ESI-MSn and screening for their antioxidant activity ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-quantification-phenolic-compounds-selected-fruits-madeira-island-hplcdadesimsn-screen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4497175,"mean":4.7666293194958,"rank":3451804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":133152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4497175,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123144,"mean":7.5810004466353,"rank":90782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123144,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2097,"mean":2.6944513358779,"rank":1334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2097,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":2.3743076923077,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
