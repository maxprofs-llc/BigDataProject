There is, however, increasing evidence for the presence of a previously unrecognised impingement-type condition around the hip - ischiofemoral impingement. This is caused by abnormal contact between the lesser trochanter of the femur and the ischium, and presents as atypical groin and\/or posterior buttock pain. The symptoms are gradual in onset and may be similar to those of iliopsoas tendonitis, hamstring injury or bursitis. The presence of ischiofemoral impingement may be indicated by pain caused by a combination of hip extension, adduction and external rotation. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates inflammation and oedema in the ischiofemoral space and quadratus femoris, and is distinct from an acute tear. To date this has only appeared in the specialist orthopaedic literature as a problem that has developed after total hip replacement, not in the unreplaced joint.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059fd","authors":["G.
