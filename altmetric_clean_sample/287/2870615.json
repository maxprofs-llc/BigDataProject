Grounded theory methodology was utilized in order to identify emergent themes and their interrelations, and build a meaningful, comprehensive theory of life after gastric bypass.\nPatients' report of a rebirth\/transformation was identified as the core process of the theory. The changes marking this process were clearly conceptualized in dichotomous terms comparing pre to postsurgical life. Patients reported changes that they regarded as unequivocally positive, a number of which had not been previously reported in the literature. Unique to this particular study was the finding of numerous life changes that generated tension and posed challenges in various aspects of patients' lives.\nThe grounded theory proposes that the extent to which patients successfully negotiate tension-generating changes may be a major determinant in the long-term outcome of gastric bypass, both weight loss and psychosocial adjustment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f610008357","authors":["Lindsey E Bocchieri","Marta Meana","Barry L Fisher"],"doi":"10.1381\/096089202320995556","first_seen_on":"2014-11-10T18:44:06+00:00","issns":["1708-0428","17080428","0960-8923","09608923"],"issue":"6","journal":"Obesity Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1415644961,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1381\/096089202320995556","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1381\/096089202320995556"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1381%2F096089202320995556.pdf","pmid":"12568182","pubdate":"2002-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism","generalsurgery"],"title":"Perceived Psychosocial Outcomes of Gastric Bypass Surgery: A Qualitative Study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1381\/096089202320995556","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perceived-psychosocial-outcomes-gastric-bypass-surgery-qualitative-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.636,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.636},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7361823,"mean":6.3962941763562,"rank":942226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6419689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7361823,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198031,"mean":7.7815549462204,"rank":30579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":167451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198031,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1682,"mean":3.1585508625818,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1682,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":3.8074626865672,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
