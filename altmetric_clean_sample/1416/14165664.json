Four hundred and twenty-seven patients from the China RIC Cooperative Group were enrolled, including 301 in the MRD, 79 in the HID, and 47 in the MUD groups. The conditioning regimen involved fludarabine combined with anti-lymphocyte globulin and cyclophosphamide. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was administered using cyclosporin A (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Four hundred and nineteen patients achieved stable donor chimerism. The incidence of stage II-IV acute GVHD in the HID group was 44.3\u00a0%, significantly higher than that in the MRD (23.6\u00a0%) and MUD (19.1\u00a0%) groups. The 1-year transplantation-related mortality (TRM) rates were 44.3, 17.6, and 21.3, respectively. Event-free survival (EFS) at 6\u00a0years in the HID group was 36.7\u00a0%, significantly lower than that of the MRD and MUD groups (59.1 and 66.0\u00a0%, P\u2009<\u20090.001 and P\u2009=\u20090.001, respectively). For advanced leukemia, the relapse rate of the HID group was 18.5\u00a0%, lower than that of the MRD group (37.5\u00a0%, P\u2009=\u20090.05), but the EFS at 6\u00a0years was 31.7 and 30.4\u00a0% (P\u2009>\u20090.05), respectively. RIC transplantation with MRD and MUD had similar outcome in leukemia which is better than that with HID. RIC transplantation with HID had lower relapsed with higher TRM and GVHD rate, particularly in advanced leukemias. RIC transplantation with MRD and MUD had similar outcomes in leukemia and they were better than those with HID. RIC transplantation with HID had a lower relapse rate but higher TRM and GVHD rates, particularly in cases of advanced leukemia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002278","authors":["Chang-Lin Yu","Zheng-Dong","Zhen-Hua Qiao","Jian-Min Wang","Huang-He","Ying-Min Liang","De-Pei Wu","Bao-An Chen","Bai-Hai","Bao-Fu Shi","Wan-Jun Sun","Jun-Xiao Qiao","Mei Guo","Jian-Hui Qiao","Qi-Yun Sun","Kai-Xun Hu","Ya-Jing Huang","Hong-li Zuo","Xiao-Jun Huang","Hui-Sheng Ai"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00277-016-2864-y","first_seen_on":"2016-11-29T20:05:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0584"],"journal":"Annals of Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1480449924,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00277-016-2864-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00277-016-2864-y.pdf","pmid":"27864604","pubdate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"The long-term outcome of reduced-intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a matched related or unrelated donor, or haploidentical family donor in patients with leukemia: a retrospective analysis of data from the China RIC Cooperative Group","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-outcome-reducedintensity-allogeneic-stem-cell-transplantation-matched-related-unrelated-don"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7822782,"mean":6.6331385505942,"rank":5933337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1046928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7822782,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250499,"mean":12.182817531477,"rank":173263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":47289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250499,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":580,"mean":2.1024905008636,"rank":378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":580,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.93461538461538,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PrecisionMedUS\/statuses\/803691348868079616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14165664],"posted_on":"2016-11-29T20:05:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Precision Med US","url":"https:\/\/goo.gl\/9z4Cb4","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/857656340264529922\/20M_tNBT_normal.jpg","description":"Coming soon: World Precision Medicine Congress USA 2017! #PrecisionMedicine #PMedUSA Visit the website to learn more! https:\/\/goo.gl\/9z4Cb4","id_on_source":"PrecisionMedUS","tweeter_id":"724701677039792130","geo":{"lt":43.00035,"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US"},"followers":1685},"tweet_id":"803691348868079616"}]}}
