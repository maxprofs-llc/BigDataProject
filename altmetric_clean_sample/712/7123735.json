At baseline, participants completed self-report depression and anxiety screens. Data regarding CVD events were obtained from an electronic medical record system and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services analytic files.\nDuring follow-up, 683 (33%) experienced a CVD event. Cox proportional hazards models-adjusted for demographic and CVD risk factors-revealed that a positive anxiety screen, but not a positive depression screen, was associated with an increased risk of a hard CVD event in separate models (Years 0-3: anxiety hazard ratio [HR] = 1.54, p < .001; Years 3+: anxiety HR = 0.99, p = .93; depression HR = 1.10, p = .41), as well as when entered into the same model (Years 0-3: anxiety HR = 1.53, p < .001; Years 3+: anxiety HR = 0.99, p = .99; depression HR = 1.03, p = .82). Analyses examining individual items and secondary outcomes showed that the anxiety-CVD association was largely driven by the feeling anxious item and the myocardial infarction outcome.\nAnxiety, especially feeling anxious, is a unique risk factor for CVD events in older adults, independent of conventional risk factors and depression. Anxiety deserves increased attention as a potential factor relevant to CVD risk stratification and a potential target of CVD primary prevention efforts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008675","authors":["Stewart, Jesse C","Hawkins, Misty A W","Khambaty, Tasneem","Perkins, Anthony J","Callahan, Christopher M"],"doi":"10.1097\/psy.0000000000000315","endpage":"601","first_seen_on":"2016-05-03T10:11:56+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1534-7796","0033-3174"],"issue":"5","journal":"Psychosomatic Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1484713500,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27136495?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27136495"],"pmid":"27136495","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Depression and Anxiety Screens as Predictors of 8-Year Incidence of Myocardial Infarction and Stroke in Primary Care Patients","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depression-anxiety-screens-predictors-8year-incidence-myocardial-infarction-stroke-primary-care-pati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082727,"mean":6.8629605662661,"rank":6138346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1085523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082727,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269446,"mean":11.510155571638,"rank":188030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269446,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1685,"mean":9.4950308788599,"rank":1410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1685,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":10.070133333333,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
