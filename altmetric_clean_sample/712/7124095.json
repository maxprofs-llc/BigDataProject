The score plot from principal component analysis using the EI-MS data showed that Japanese S. flavescens samples tended to cluster away from Chinese S. flavescens samples. Statistical techniques showed that ions arising from kurarinol and kushenol H, which we previously identified as marker molecules for Japanese S. flavescens, were characteristic of Japanese S. flavescens. Therefore, metabolomics based on EI-MS data is a valuable tool for confirming the geographical origins of S. flavescens samples. The results suggest that EI-MS-based metabolomics is suitable for the quality control of traditional medicines containing many components.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd23","authors":["Suzuki, Ryuichiro","Kai, Hisahiro","Uesawa, Yoshihiro","Matsuno, Koji","Okada, Yoshihito","Shirataki, Yoshiaki"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-03T10:35:03+00:00","issns":["1934-578X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Natural product communications","last_mentioned_on":1462270990,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26996023?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26996023","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","botany","pharmacology"],"title":"Electron Ionization Mass Spectrometry-based Metabolomics Studies of Sophoraflavescens can Identify the Geographical Origin of Root Samples.","type":"article","volume":"11"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":6616208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266342,"mean":11.387019084557,"rank":222888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266342,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":414,"mean":1.8410072639225,"rank":233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":414,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.1363636363636,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/statuses\/727443373351534592","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7124095],"posted_on":"2016-05-03T10:23:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
