A resorbable implant, a self-locking loop designed for surgery, was developed as an alternative to traditional ligation. The study aimed to test the feasibility of ligating the canine ovarian pedicle with the implant and to compare its performance to traditional suture ligation.\nIn total 45 intact female dogs destined for elective ovariohysterectomy and adoption were included. In 21 dogs the new resorbable implant was used to ligate the mesovarium, and in 24 control dogs traditional suture was used with one encircling ligature. Mean weight of implant dogs was 10.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6\u00a0kg (range 3.5-22.0), and mean weight of control dogs was 12.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0kg, (range 4.1-27.0). The body weight of dogs did not differ between groups (P\u00a0=\u00a00.25). In total, 42 ovarian pedicles were successfully ligated with the implant. In one control dog, intraoperative haemorrhage from the left ovarian pedicle was diagnosed. The mesovarium was re-ligated and haemostasis was confirmed. All dogs recovered uneventfully. The ligation time of the mesovarium was significantly shortened (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) by using the self-locking implant versus a single ligature (3'28''\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01'05'' and 5'29''\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03'54'', respectively). Total duration of surgery differed between the groups (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) with a shortened duration of surgery when using the self-locking implant (15'56''\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02'47'' and 20'39''\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08'58'', study group versus control group, respectively). In both groups, duration of surgery and time required to ligate the ovarian pedicle were longer in larger dogs than smaller dogs.\nThe results of this feasibility study suggested the implant can be used to ligate the canine mesovarium. Compared with traditional suture ligation, the results suggested that time to ligate the ovarian pedicle and duration of surgery were significantly reduced with the implant. More time was required to perform surgeries in larger dogs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000798","authors":["da Mota Costa, Matheus Roberto","de Abreu Oliveira, Andr\u00e9 Lacerda","Ramos, Renato Moran","de Moura Vidal, Leonardo Waldstein","Borg, Niklas","H\u00f6glund, Odd V","Matheus Roberto Mota Costa","Andr\u00e9 Lacerda Abreu Oliveira","Renato Moran Ramos","Leonardo Waldstein Moura Vidal","Niklas Borg","Odd V.
