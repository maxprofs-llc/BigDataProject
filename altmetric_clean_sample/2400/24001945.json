The aim of this study was to examine the long-term effects of prescribed exercise on depression, performed at 3 intensity levels. People aged 18-67years with mild to moderate depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score of \u226510) participated in a single-blind, parallel randomized control trial lasting 12weeks (Sweden 2011-2013). Four arms were included: Treatment as usual (TAU, n=310), light (n=106), moderate (n=105) and vigorous exercise (n=99). Severity of depression was measured at baseline, post-treatment and 12-month follow-up using the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Coefficients (\u03b2) and odds ratios were estimated using linear mixed models with time\u00d7group interactions. The results showed that at the 12month follow-up the light exercise group had significantly lower depression severity scores than the TAU (-1.9, 95% CI: -3.7, -0.04) and the moderate exercise group (-2.94 95% CI: -5.2, -0.7). The vigorous exercise group had significantly lower scores than the moderate exercise group only (-2.7, 95% CI: -4.9, -0.4). In conclusion, compared to usual care for depression, only light exercise resulted in significantly lower depression severity at 12-month follow-up. Both light and vigorous exercise was more effective than moderate exercise.\nThe study was registered with the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS study ID: DRKS00008745).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003383","authors":["Helgad\u00f3ttir, Bj\u00f6rg","Forsell, Yvonne","Hallgren, Mats","M\u00f6ller, Jette","Ekblom, \u00d6rjan","Bj\u00f6rg Helgad\u00f3ttir","Yvonne Forsell","Mats Hallgren","Jette M\u00f6ller","\u00d6rjan Ekblom"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ypmed.2017.08.008","first_seen_on":"2017-08-17T21:43:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0091-7435","00917435","1096-0260"],"journal":"Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1504689877,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0091743517302943?dgcid=raven_sd_aip_email","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0091743517302943","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0091743517302943&_version=1&md5=92e522b55d56de6527df2750c558aee7"],"pmid":"28823684","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Long-term effects of exercise at different intensity levels on depression: A randomized controlled trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-effects-exercise-different-intensity-levels-depression-randomized-controlled-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.05,"score_history":{"1y":6.05,"6m":6.05,"3m":6.05,"1m":6.05,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8373007,"mean":7.0576589951014,"rank":1384941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6983649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8373007,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160194,"mean":12.755694356183,"rank":35080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":124912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160194,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2614,"mean":12.061487179487,"rank":733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2614,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":40.565625,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":1,"US":2,"NL":2,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MaritaHennessy\/statuses\/898299106350833664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24001945],"posted_on":"2017-08-17T21:42:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Marita Hennessy","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Marita_Hennessy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/896056294246952972\/BEWpvdiE_normal.jpg","description":"@SPHeREprogramme PhD Scholar @hbcrg.
