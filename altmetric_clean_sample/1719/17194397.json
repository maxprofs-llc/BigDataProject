However, the safety and potential benefits of bariatric surgery for NAFLD with advanced fibrosis (stage 3-4) remain unclear. This study was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in patients with biopsy proven advanced fibrosis to those with minimal fibrosis.\nAll patients who underwent bariatric surgery between 2005-2014 and had evidence of NAFLD with fibrosis score 3-4 (advanced fibrosis) based on the staging system defined by Kleiner et al. on intraoperative liver biopsy were included and compared with patients who had fibrosis score 1-2 (minimal fibrosis). The groups were compared for length of hospital stay after bariatric surgery and incidence of postoperative complications over a follow-up period of one year. An improvement in hepatic function tests before and one year after surgery was used as a parameter to evaluate for NAFLD improvement.\n99 patients with F3-4 (group 1) and 198 patients with F1-2 (group 2) were included. Mean age (51.9 vs 50.1 years) and BMI (46.4 vs 46.5\u2009kg\/m(2)) were similar in the two groups. Median serum aspartate amino transferase (43.0 vs 30\u2009U\/l; normal 10-40\u2009U\/l) and alanine amino transferase (40.5 vs 34\u2009U\/l; normal 10-50\u2009U\/l) were significantly higher in Group 1 and improved one year after surgery. Median length of hospital stay after surgery was higher in group 1 than that in group 2 (4 days vs 3 days; P-value=0.002). The proportion of patients developing postoperative complications over one year was similar in both groups (36.4 vs 32.8%; P-value=0.54).\nAdvanced fibrosis does not increase the risk of developing postoperative complications in medically optimized patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Improvement in serum transaminase levels suggests a reduction in hepatic necroinflammatory activity following bariatric surgery.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 24 November 2016. doi:10.1038\/ijo.2016.212.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b83","authors":["T Singh","G S Kochhar","G B Goh","P Schauer","S Brethauer","M Kroh","A Aminian","R Lopez","S Dasarathy","A J McCullough"],"doi":"10.1038\/ijo.2016.212","endpage":"449","first_seen_on":"2017-03-10T10:55:40+00:00","issns":["0307-0565","1476-5497"],"journal":"International Journal of Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1489143329,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/v41\/n3\/full\/ijo2016212a.html"],"pmid":"27881858","pubdate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Bariatric surgery","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Obesity","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"443","subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in patients with advanced fibrosis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ijo.2016.212","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-efficacy-bariatric-surgery-patients-advanced-fibrosis-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6326382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1128692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242034,"mean":13.666354654117,"rank":175706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242034,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2464,"mean":16.10161591555,"rank":2198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2464,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":25.693859649123,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TheFitDr\/statuses\/840154133592190976","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17194397],"posted_on":"2017-03-10T10:55:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr. Stuart Fischer","url":"http:\/\/www.TheFitDr.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3158137503\/812ea0ada2403291f505aa5a16131913_normal.png","description":"Medical director of the King David Center; Professor of Medicine at Downstate; author of four books; media personality and health columnist.","id_on_source":"TheFitDr","tweeter_id":"1090070120","geo":{"lt":40.71427,"ln":-74.00597,"country":"US"},"followers":23692},"tweet_id":"840154133592190976"}]}}
