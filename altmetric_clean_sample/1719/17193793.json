Extruded AZ91 rod has a uniform microstructure and typical fiber texture. Torsion deformation can generate a gradient microstructure on the cross-section of the rod. After torsion, from the center to the edge in the cross-section of the rod, both stored dislocations and area fraction of {10-12} twins gradually increase, and the basal pole of the texture tends to rotate in the ED direction. Direct aging usually generates coarse discontinuous precipitates and fine continuous precipitates simultaneously. Both twin structures and dislocations via torsion deformation can be effective microstructures for the nucleation of continuous precipitates during subsequent aging. Thus, aging after torsion can promote continuous precipitation and generate gradient precipitation characteristics. Both aging treatment and torsion deformation can reduce yield asymmetry, and torsion deformation enhances the aging hardening effect by promoting continuous precipitation. Therefore, combined use of torsion deformation and aging treatment can effectively enhance the yield strength and almost eliminate the yield asymmetry of the present extruded AZ91 rod. Finally, the relevant mechanisms are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bc","authors":["Bo Song","Chunpeng Wang","Ning Guo","Hucheng Pan","Renlong Xin"],"doi":"10.3390\/ma10030280","first_seen_on":"2017-03-10T10:36:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1996-1944"],"issue":"3","journal":"Materials (1996-1944)","last_mentioned_on":1489142159,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/3\/280?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/10\/3\/280\/pdf","pmid":"28772638","pubdate":"2017-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Improving Tensile and Compressive Properties of an Extruded AZ91 Rod by the Combined Use of Torsion Deformation and Aging Treatment","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-tensile-compressive-properties-extruded-az91-rod-combined-torsion-deformation-aging-treatm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6326382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1128697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242033,"mean":13.66640285582,"rank":175706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242033,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1190,"mean":0.96334230445753,"rank":542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1190,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275,"mean":0.7478102189781,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
