However, research to date has concentrated on elucidating evolutionary patterns of genomic components shared between species, rather than identifying disparities between genomes. In this study, we searched for gene losses in the lineage leading to eutherian mammals. First, as a pilot analysis, we selected five gene families (Wnt, Fgf, Tbx, TGF\u03b2, and Frizzled) for molecular phylogenetic analyses, and identified mammalian lineage-specific losses of Wnt11b, Tbx6L\/VegT\/tbx16, Nodal-related, ADMP1, ADMP2, Sizzled, and Crescent. Second, automated genome-wide phylogenetic screening was implemented based on this pilot analysis. As a result, we detected 147 chicken genes without eutherian orthologs, which resulted from 141 gene loss events. Our inventory contained a group of regulatory genes governing early embryonic axis formation, such as Noggins, and multiple members of the opsin and prolactin-releasing hormone receptor (\"PRLHR\") gene families. Our findings highlight the potential of genome-wide gene phylogeny (\"phylome\") analysis in detecting possible rearrangement of gene networks and the importance of identifying losses of ancestral genomic components in analyzing the molecular basis underlying phenotypic evolution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ce3cf058f6100005a7","doi":"10.1093\/gbe\/evr120","first_seen_on":"2011-11-18T16:59:18+00:00","issns":["1759-6653"],"journal":"Genome Biology & Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1322121537,"links":["http:\/\/gbe.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2011\/11\/17\/gbe.evr120.long","http:\/\/gbe.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2011\/11\/17\/gbe.evr120.abstract?etoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/gbe.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2011\/11\/17\/gbe.evr120.full.pdf","pmid":"22094861","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biology"],"title":"Genome-wide Detection of Gene Extinction in Early Mammalian Evolution","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-detection-gene-extinction-early-mammalian-evolution"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2081521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2872571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232428,"mean":4.4602083837078,"rank":69274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":157671,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232428,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":969,"mean":6.0422231404959,"rank":511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":969,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":9.6042105263158,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
