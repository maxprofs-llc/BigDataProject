This creates a tightly interwoven network regulating and underlying oncogenesis and cancer biology. Although protein-coding gene signatures and single protein pathway markers have proliferated over the past decade, routine adoption of the former has been hampered by interpretability, reproducibility, and dimensionality, whereas the single molecule-phenotype reductionism of the latter is often overly simplistic to account for complex phenotypes. MicroRNA-derived biomarkers offer a powerful alternative; they have both the flexibility of gene expression signature classifiers and the desirable mechanistic transparency of single protein biomarkers. Furthermore, several advances have recently demonstrated the robust detection of microRNAs from various biofluids, thus providing an additional opportunity for obtaining bioinformatically derived biomarkers to accelerate the identification of individual patients for personalized therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5743cf058f610004cca","authors":["Yves A Lussier","Walter M Stadler","James L Chen","Lussier YA","Stadler WM","Chen JL"],"doi":"10.1136\/amiajnl-2011-000419","endpage":"160","first_seen_on":"2011-11-18T17:43:16+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1527-974X","1067-5027"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","last_mentioned_on":1328660232,"links":["http:\/\/jamia.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2011\/11\/17\/amiajnl-2011-000419.short?rss=1&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/jamia.bmj.com\/content\/19\/2\/156.short?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed&rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jamia.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2011\/11\/17\/amiajnl-2011-000419.full.pdf","pmid":"22101905","pubdate":"2011-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"156","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Advantages of genomic complexity: bioinformatics opportunities in microRNA cancer signatures","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/advantages-genomic-complexity-bioinformatics-opportunities-microrna-cancer-signatures-figure-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":3533661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":842363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232422,"mean":4.4638293269544,"rank":147200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":42411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232422,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1241,"mean":8.5420129032258,"rank":1067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1241,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":4.7023043478261,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
