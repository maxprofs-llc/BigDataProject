However, the notion of functionally distinct microtubule types has not been explored with similar intensity, mostly because mechanisms for generating divergent microtubule species were not yet known. Cells generate distinct microtubule subtypes through expression of different tubulin isotypes and through post-translational modifications, such as detyrosination and further cleavage to \u03942-tubulin, acetylation, polyglutamylation and polyglycylation. The recent discovery of enzymes responsible for many tubulin post-translational modifications has enabled functional studies demonstrating that these post-translational modifications may regulate microtubule functions through an amazing range of mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316d","authors":["Carsten Janke","Jeannette Chlo\u00eb Bulinski"],"doi":"10.1038\/nrm3227","endpage":"786","first_seen_on":"2011-11-23T15:45:57+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1471-0072","1471-0080"],"issue":"12","journal":"Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1493385973,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrm\/journal\/v12\/n12\/full\/nrm3227.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org\/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=22086369","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nrm3227","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22086369"],"pmid":"22086369","pubdate":"2011-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"773","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Post-translational regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton: mechanisms and functions.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/posttranslational-regulation-microtubule-cytoskeleton-mechanisms-functions-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8138092,"mean":6.879675480889,"rank":1905724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6195365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8138092,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245677,"mean":5.1164752926621,"rank":54638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":189026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245677,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1531,"mean":5.8677019607843,"rank":574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1531,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.8661851851852,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":24,"Researcher":93,"Student  > Doctoral Student":21,"Student  > Ph.
