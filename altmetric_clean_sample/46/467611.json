In contrast to the frequency-sweep EIS approach, measuring with broadband signals, i.e., multisine excitations, enables to collect, simultaneously, multiple myocardium tissue impedance data in a short measuring time. However, reducing the measuring time makes the measurements to be prone to the influence of the transients introduced by noise and the dynamic time-varying properties of tissue. This paper presents a novel approach for the impedance-frequency-response estimation based on the local polynomial method (LPM). The fast LPM version presented rejects the leakage error's influence on the impedance frequency response when measuring electrical bioimpedance in a short time. The theory is supported by a set of validation measurements. Novel preliminary experimental results obtained from real-time in vivo healthy myocardium tissue impedance characterization within the cardiac cycle using multisine excitation are reported.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a47","authors":["Vandersteen, G."],"doi":"10.1109\/tbme.2011.2166116","first_seen_on":"2011-11-24T11:24:16+00:00","issns":["0018-9294"],"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1322133381,"links":["http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/freeabs_all.jsp?isnumber=6082053&arnumber=5999711"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/iel5\/10\/6082053\/05999711.pdf?arnumber=5999711","pmid":"21878408","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IEEE","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Novel Estimation of the Electrical Bioimpedance Using the Local Polynomial Method.
