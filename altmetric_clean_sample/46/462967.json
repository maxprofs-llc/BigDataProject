This study examined within- and between-population pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue, and genetic variation and structure using 15 allozyme loci in Centaurium erythraea, an insect-pollinated, early-successional forest biennial herb occurring in a peri-urban forest (Brussels urban zone, Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (<15 m), and only a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns. The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding coefficients (F(IS)) and high genetic differentiation (F(ST)), suggesting restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank, contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road verges. These landscape elements might therefore have a potential conservation value by contributing to connectivity of early-successional species populations located in patchy open habitats.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003332","authors":["Van Rossum, F."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1438-8677.2008.00176.x","endpage":"737","first_seen_on":"2011-11-20T14:35:51+00:00","issns":["1438-8677","14388677"],"issue":"5","journal":"Plant Biology","last_mentioned_on":1321459059,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1438-8677.2008.00176.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1438-8677.2008.00176.x\/pdf","pmid":"19689780","pubdate":"2009-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"725","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Pollen dispersal and genetic variation in an early\u00e2\u0080\u0090successional forest herb in a peri\u00e2\u0080\u0090urban forest","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pollen-dispersal-genetic-variation-earlysuccessional-forest-herb-periurban-forest"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6376562,"mean":5.987737073322,"rank":5431565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6376562,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232125,"mean":4.7092158673814,"rank":191086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232125,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":332,"mean":2.3348459214502,"rank":206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":332,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.0857142857143,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
