Given that tissue angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) regulates such responses and that the deletion (D) [rather than insertion (I)] variant of the ACE gene is associated with higher tissue ACE levels, DD genotype might be associated with a poorer outcome in a uniform infectious disease state. Illness severity (Pediatric RIsk of Mortality score, the Glasgow Meningococcal Septicaemia Prognostic Score [GMSPS], and clinical course) was recorded for consecutive white patients with meningococcal disease (n = 110, 34 DD genotype, 61 male, aged 49.4 +\/- 5.4 months) referred to the Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital, UK. Compared with children with > or = I allele, DD genotype was associated with 14% higher predicted risk of mortality (p = 0.038), higher GMSPS (DD 9.4 +\/- 0.5, ID\/II 7.7+\/- 0.4 [mean +\/- SEM], p = 0.013), greater prevalence of inotropic support (76% versus 55%, p = 0.03) and ventilation (82% versus 63%, p = 0.04), and longer Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay (5.8 versus 3.9, p = 0.02). DD genotype frequency was 6% (1 case) for the 18 children who did not require PICU care, 33% for the 84 PICU survivors, and 45% for those who died (p = 0.01). ACE DD is associated with increased illness severity in meningococcal disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005716","authors":["Harding, David","Baines, Paul B","Brull, David","Vassiliou, Vassilis","Ellis, Ian","Hart, Anthony","Thomson, Alistair P J","Humphries, Steve E","Montgomery, Hugh E"],"doi":"10.1164\/ajrccm.165.8.2108089","first_seen_on":"2011-11-23T14:09:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1073-449X"],"issue":"8","journal":"American Journal of Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1322056800,"links":["http:\/\/ajrccm.atsjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/165\/8\/1103"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajrccm.atsjournals.org\/cgi\/reprint\/165\/8\/1103.pdf","pmid":"11956052","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Am Thoracic Soc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Severity of Meningococcal Disease in Children and the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Insertion\/Deletion Polymorphism","type":"article","volume":"165","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/severity-meningococcal-disease-children-angiotensinconverting-enzyme-insertiondeletion-polymorphism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":328804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3269292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226161,"mean":3.8993527856387,"rank":19985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":204731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226161,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2044,"mean":4.4914047968674,"rank":226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":1812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2044,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":4.2873538461538,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
