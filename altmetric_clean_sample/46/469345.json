However, clean slate effects might not characterize all nonmorally based decision making, particularly for people who mentally \"get stuck\" making decisions (i.e., compromised decision making).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d07","authors":["De Los Reyes, Andres","Aldao, Amelia","Kundey, Shannon M.A.","Lee, Bern G.","Molina, Sabrina"],"doi":"10.1002\/jclp.20851","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2011-11-25T19:25:06+00:00","issns":["1097-4679","0021-9762"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Clinical Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1335557048,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jclp.20851\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jclp.20851\/pdf","pmid":"22105558","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Compromised decision making and the effects of manipulating physical states on human judgments","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/compromised-decision-making-effects-manipulating-physical-states-human-judgments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":4207505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232909,"mean":4.4609086420392,"rank":190516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232909,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":701,"mean":4.3678742857143,"rank":608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":701,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":3.4727848101266,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
