Medical and surgical management of the child with intestinal failure was presented with a focus on the importance of multidisciplinary intestinal failure management. Issues of timing of referral and benefit risk analysis for intestine \"rehabilitation\" and transplant were presented. Areas of opportunity such as increased donor recovery, improvement of long-term transplant outcomes, optimization of immune monitoring, and quality-of-life outcomes were reviewed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008bed","doi":"10.1097\/tp.0b013e318234c325","first_seen_on":"2011-11-23T00:42:14+00:00","issns":["0041-1337"],"issue":"11","journal":"Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1328271724,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/transplantjournal\/Abstract\/2011\/12150\/Current_Status_of_Pediatric_Intestinal_Failure,.1.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/transplantjournal\/Fulltext\/2011\/12150\/Current_Status_of_Pediatric_Intestinal_Failure,.1.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22067308?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/transplantjournal\/2011\/12150\/Current_Status_of_Pediatric_Intestinal_Failure,.1.pdf","pmid":"22067308","pubdate":"2011-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1173","title":"Current Status of Pediatric Intestinal Failure, Rehabilitation, and Transplantation: Summary of a Colloquium","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-status-pediatric-intestinal-failure-rehabilitation-transplantation-summary-colloquium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":2325547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1543901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229622,"mean":4.1843699226119,"rank":98969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":96018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229622,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2134,"mean":1.7559324894515,"rank":885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2134,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":1.2763333333333,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
