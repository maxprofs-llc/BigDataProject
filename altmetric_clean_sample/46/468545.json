This study investigated the rates of parent-reported DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision) disorders in a large community sample of preschoolers using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA). Five hundred forty-one parents were interviewed with the PAPA. Of the children, 27.4% met criteria for a PAPA\/DSM-IV diagnosis; 9.2% met criteria for 2 or more diagnoses. Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (9.4%), specific phobia (9.1%), and separation anxiety disorder (5.4%) were the most common diagnoses; depression (1.8%), selective mutism (1.5%), and panic disorder (0.2%) were the least common. In addition, there was significant comorbidity\/covariation between depression, anxiety, and ODD and between ODD and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (odds ratios = 1.81-18.44; P < .05), and significant associations with measures of psychosocial functioning. The stability and clinical significance of diagnoses and patterns of comorbidity must be elucidated in future research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000582e","authors":["Bufferd SJ","Dougherty LR","Carlson GA","Klein DN"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.comppsych.2010.08.006","first_seen_on":"2011-11-25T03:46:00+00:00","issns":["1532-8384","0010-440X","0010440X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Comprehensive Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1322191474,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21683173"],"pmcid":"PMC3119453","pmid":"21683173","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Parent-reported mental health in preschoolers: findings using a diagnostic interview.","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parentreported-mental-health-preschoolers-findings-using-diagnostic-interview"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":4207586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232908,"mean":4.4609662225698,"rank":190520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232908,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":861,"mean":2.611076744186,"rank":764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":861,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.3977272727273,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
