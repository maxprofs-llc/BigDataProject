Background: The ideal treatment of mandibular subcondylar fractures continues to be debated. Acceptable results are often obtained with conservative measures such as mandibular maxillary fixation followed by elastics. On the other hand, an open approaches result in potential risk injury to the facial nerve. These 2 arguments have cautioned many surgeons from open treatment of condylar fractures. Recent advances in endoscopic techniques have made the mandibular condyle more accessible with less risk to the facial nerve. As with any new technique, endoscopic treatment of mandibular subcondylar fractures is not without its own limitations and complications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","doi":"10.1097\/scs.0b013e31823270e3","first_seen_on":"2011-11-25T07:49:03+00:00","issns":["1049-2275"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1322207105,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Pitfalls_in_Endoscopic_Treatment_of_Mandibular.99289.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Pitfalls_in_Endoscopic_Treatment_of_Mandibular.99289.pdf","pmid":"22075825","pubdate":"2011-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Pitfalls in Endoscopic Treatment of Mandibular Subcondylar Fractures","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pitfalls-endoscopic-treatment-mandibular-subcondylar-fractures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3513214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":134414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229699,"mean":4.1575936577595,"rank":174704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229699,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2563,"mean":0.9336237314598,"rank":1601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2563,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157,"mean":0.75,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
