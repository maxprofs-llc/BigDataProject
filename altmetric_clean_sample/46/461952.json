Therefore, the relationship between dispersal ability and speciation rates can be positive or negative. Furthermore, an 'intermediate dispersal' model that combines positive and negative effects predicts a unimodal relationship between dispersal and diversification. Because both dispersal ability and speciation rates are difficult to quantify, empirical evidence for the relationship between dispersal and diversification remains scarce. Using a surrogate for flight performance and a species-level DNA-based phylogeny of a large South American bird radiation (the Furnariidae), we found that lineages with higher dispersal ability experienced lower speciation rates. We propose that the degree of fragmentation or permeability of the geographical setting together with the intermediate dispersal model are crucial in reconciling previous, often contradictory findings regarding the relationship between dispersal and diversification.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a3","doi":"10.1098\/rspb.2011.1922","first_seen_on":"2011-11-19T14:58:09+00:00","issns":["1471-2954"],"journal":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1331302543,"links":["http:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/early\/2011\/11\/12\/rspb.2011.1922.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/early\/2011\/11\/12\/rspb.2011.1922.full.pdf","pmid":"22090382","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"High dispersal ability inhibits speciation in a continental radiation of passerine birds","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-dispersal-ability-inhibits-speciation-continental-radiation-passerine-birds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2940706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1424451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229239,"mean":4.1967189994681,"rank":133322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":86475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229239,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4221,"mean":17.090127962085,"rank":3765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4221,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":16.314070967742,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":57,"Student  > Doctoral Student":30,"Student  > Ph.
