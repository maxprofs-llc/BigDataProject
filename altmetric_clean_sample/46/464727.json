Here we review these developments and, where possible, highlight generic new approaches to solving membrane protein structures based on recent technological advances. Rational approaches to overcoming the bottlenecks in the field are urgently required as membrane proteins, which typically comprise ~30% of the proteomes of organisms, are dramatically under-represented in the structural database of the Protein Data Bank.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003162","authors":["Roslyn M Bill","Peter J F Henderson","So Iwata","Edmund R S Kunji","Hartmut Michel","Richard Neutze","Simon Newstead","Bert Poolman","Christopher G Tate","Horst Vogel","Bill RM","Henderson PJ","Iwata S","Kunji ER","Michel H","Neutze R","Newstead S","Poolman B","Tate CG","Vogel H"],"doi":"10.1038\/nbt.1833","endpage":"340","first_seen_on":"2011-11-22T11:33:03+00:00","funders":["mrc","bbsrc"],"issns":["1087-0156","1546-1696"],"issue":"4","journal":"Nature Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1321958910,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nbt\/journal\/v29\/n4\/abs\/nbt.1833.html"],"pmid":"21478852","pubdate":"2011-04-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"335","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Overcoming barriers to membrane protein structure determination","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nbt.1833","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overcoming-barriers-membrane-protein-structure-determination-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629051,"mean":4.9368884016521,"rank":2016410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629051,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226277,"mean":3.8924607912463,"rank":97296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":89458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226277,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2689,"mean":13.229950148809,"rank":2017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2689,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":8.3929662921348,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":14,"Researcher":93,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
