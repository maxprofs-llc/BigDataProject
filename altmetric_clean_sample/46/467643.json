In addition, human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) are increasingly accepted as a source for stem cell therapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the EBN extract (EBNE) on the proliferation of hADSCs and its action mechanisms. We found that EBNE strongly promoted the proliferation of hADSCs. In addition, EBNE-induced proliferation was found to be mediated through the production of IL-6 and VEGF, which was induced by activation of AP-1 and NF-\u03baB. Specially, we found that production of IL-6 and VEGF was induced by EBNE. In addition, EBNE-induced production of IL-6 and VEGF was inhibited by PD98059 (a p44\/42 MAPK inhibitor), SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor), and PDTC (a NF-\u03baB inhibitor), but not SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor). Similarly, EBNE-induced proliferation of hADSCs was also attenuated by PD98059, SB203580, and PDTC but not SP600125. Taken together, these findings suggest that the EBNE-induced proliferation of hADSCs primarily occurs through increased expression of IL-6 and VEGF genes, which is mediated by the activation of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 through p44\/42 MAPK and p38 MAPK.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Roh,
