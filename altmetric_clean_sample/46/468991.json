The study took place in six junior secondary schools of varying socioeconomic status in Gaborone, Botswana. Using a qualitative descriptive design, semistructured interviews were conducted with key school personnel. Directed content analysis was used to summarize the findings. School personnel believed that obesity was an important problem. They felt that school food was unhealthy and that physical activity was provided insufficiently. Participants shared enthusiasm for a school-based health-promoting intervention that must be fun and include active engagement and education on healthy lifestyles for all students. Participants supported on-site food shop inventory changes and physical activity programs. Potential barriers listed were schools' financial resources, interest of students, and time limitations of all involved.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005aa8","doi":"10.1177\/1059840511429003","first_seen_on":"2011-11-25T13:39:34+00:00","issns":["1546-8364"],"journal":"Journal of School Nursing (Allen Press Publishing Services Inc.)","last_mentioned_on":1346358170,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22114299?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22114299","pubdate":"2011-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","healthservices"],"title":"Adolescent Obesity Prevention in Botswana: Beliefs and Recommendations of School Personnel.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adolescent-obesity-prevention-botswana"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":2897922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226223,"mean":3.8716234141687,"rank":161270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226223,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":2.1921438848921,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.64375,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
