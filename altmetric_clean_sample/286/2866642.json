However, new epidermal islands are frequently formed on the granulation tissue remote from the wound edge. Thus, current theory of \"bulge\"-originating stem cells does not necessarily correspond to the histological pictures of the healing wound. We took imprints of a leg ulcer surface and found single dispersed, large nucleated cells, some of them in mitosis. These cells resembled those from epidermal spinosum layer. The question arouse as to whether these cells might be the \"spore-like\" stem cells creating epidermal island. We found similarly shaped cells among the keratinocyte preserved in pulverized sodium chloride as the only surviving population in culture and revealing enzymatic activity. The aim of this work was to study whether the population of human keratinocytes surviving sodium chloride preservation and transplanted to SCID mice may form epidermis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003694","authors":["W L Olszewski","A Domaszewska-Szostek","M Moscicka-Weso\u0142owska","M Zaleska"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.transproceed.2014.09.101","first_seen_on":"2014-11-09T11:04:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2623"],"issue":"8","journal":"Transplantation Proceedings","last_mentioned_on":1415530926,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25380942?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25380942","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Transplantation of keratinocyte spore-like stem cells.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transplantation-keratinocyte-sporelike-stem-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2668792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1697843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145153,"mean":8.7928617449297,"rank":75218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":53211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145153,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":809,"mean":1.3712846534653,"rank":243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":809,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.1848,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
