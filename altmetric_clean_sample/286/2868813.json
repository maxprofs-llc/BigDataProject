We suggest combining these new efforts with the already existing efforts in clinical practice guideline development. Existing clinical practice guidelines facilitate a more participatory and evidence-based approach to the development of top 5 lists. In return, adding top 5 lists (for overuse and underuse) to existing clinical practice guidelines nicely addresses a neglected dimension to clinical practice guideline development, namely explicit information on which Do or Don't do recommendations are frequently disregarded in practice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d61","authors":["Strech D","Follmann M","Klemperer D","Lelgemann M","Ollenschl\u00e4ger G","Raspe H","Nothacker M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.zefq.2014.10.014","first_seen_on":"2014-11-10T12:13:22+00:00","issns":["18659217"],"issue":"10","journal":"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualit\u00e4t im Gesundheitswesen","last_mentioned_on":1476381212,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1865921714002311","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25499114"],"pmid":"25499114","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"When Choosing Wisely meets clinical practice guidelines.","type":"article","volume":"108","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/choosing-wisely-meets-clinical-practice-guidelines-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7534762,"mean":6.5107844469081,"rank":967916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6563586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7534762,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199087,"mean":7.8243199622276,"rank":30593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":168373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199087,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193,"mean":1.90246875,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
