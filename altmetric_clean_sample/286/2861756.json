Methods: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed in serum samples from 40 women in reproductive age. Patients were divided into four groups: I (non-eutrophic with PCOS, n\u2009=\u200912), II (non-eutrophic without PCOS, n\u2009=\u200910), III (eutrophic with PCOS, n\u2009=\u20098) and IV (eutrophic without PCOS, n\u2009=\u200910) being non-eutrophic, the overweight and obese women with BMI\u2009>\u200925\u2009kg\/m(2) and eutrophic women with BMI\u2009<\u200924.9\u2009kg\/m(2). Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) was calculated for evaluation of IR. Results: PCOS patients showed increased levels of CRP (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and HOMA-IR (p\u2009<\u20090.01). When divided by BMI, both non-eutrophic and eutrophic PCOS showed increased CRP levels (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and HOMA-IR (p\u2009<\u20090.01). There were no differences in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels between groups. Conclusion: In the PCOS group, the levels of CRP and IR were elevated, compared to their counterparts, regardless of body mass.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003cff","authors":["Ana Celly Souza Dos Santos","Nayara Pereira Soares","Eduardo Caldas Costa","Joceline C\u00e1ssia Ferrezini de S\u00e1","George Dantas Azevedo","Telma Maria Ara\u00fajo Moura Lemos"],"doi":"10.3109\/09513590.2014.976546","first_seen_on":"2014-11-07T11:02:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-0766"],"journal":"Gynecological Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1415737592,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25373529?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/09513590.2014.976546?ai=1lij&mi=3gfofr&af=R&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed&"],"pmid":"25373529","pubdate":"2014-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology","gynecology"],"title":"The impact of body mass on inflammatory markers and insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-body-mass-inflammatory-markers-insulin-resistance-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2272184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2210616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126342,"mean":8.5724496402595,"rank":62531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":62782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126342,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":471,"mean":1.6557106382979,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":471,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.842,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
