Patients with hypocalcemia have been reported to recover in 3 to 12 months after calcium and vitamin D replacement therapy as well as treatment of heart failure. A 6-month-old male patient who presented with dyspnea was admitted to the intensive care unit with severe heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy. Blood biochemistry revealed hypocalcemia and vitamin D deficiency. After administration of anticongestive treatment, positive inotropic support, as well as vitamin D and calcium supplementation, cardiac function returned to normal in a week. Our case is the first report of such a rapid improvement in cardiac morphology and function in a patient with hypocalcemic dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c16","authors":["Osman Yilmaz","Omer Kilic","Murat Ciftel","Nilay Hakan"],"doi":"10.1097\/pec.0000000000000269","first_seen_on":"2014-11-07T17:05:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-1815"],"issue":"11","journal":"Pediatric emergency care","last_mentioned_on":1415857529,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25373569"],"pmid":"25373569","pubdate":"2014-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","emergencymedicine"],"title":"Rapid response to treatment of heart failure resulting from hypocalcemic cardiomyopathy.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapid-response-treatment-heart-failure-resulting-hypocalcemic-cardiomyopathy-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1749626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2749525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126342,"mean":8.5736689594037,"rank":43487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":82616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126342,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1443,"mean":2.3460735090153,"rank":411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1443,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":2.3711764705882,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/daviesjs\/status\/530767673572212736","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2863134],"posted_on":"2014-11-07T17:04:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Steve Davies","url":"http:\/\/www.diploma-msc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1937157828\/Twitter_normal.JPG","description":"Dr Steve Davies, Consultant Endocrinologist at UHW, Cardiff, Entrepreneur and Founder of the diploma\/MSc courses with University of South Wales","id_on_source":"daviesjs","tweeter_id":"145654840","geo":{"lt":51.48,"ln":-3.18,"country":"GB"},"followers":2302},"tweet_id":"530767673572212736"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SHaRe_Registry\/status\/532625728425451521","license":"datasift","rt":["daviesjs"],"citation_ids":[2863134],"posted_on":"2014-11-12T20:07:24+00:00","author":{"name":"SHaRe Registry","url":"http:\/\/www.TheShareRegistry.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459060196820533248\/A9xt6Kl6_normal.png","description":"Global #PatientRegistry sponsored by MyoKardia, Inc. which joins researchers & patients to advance our understanding of inherited #Cardiomyopathy. #cardiology","id_on_source":"SHaRe_Registry","tweeter_id":"2460218305","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":752},"tweet_id":"532625728425451521"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cardiogenetica\/status\/532771207918395392","license":"datasift","rt":["daviesjs"],"citation_ids":[2863134],"posted_on":"2014-11-13T05:45:29+00:00","author":{"name":"cardiogenetica","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/454259094241570816\/si2wmT7C_normal.jpeg","description":"Laatste nieuws over erfelijke hartziekten","id_on_source":"cardiogenetica","tweeter_id":"1538462490","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":245},"tweet_id":"532771207918395392"}]}}
