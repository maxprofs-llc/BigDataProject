Methods: From February 2005 to October 2008, 46 SPKTs (45 portal-enteric drainage) were prospectively randomized as part of a larger kidney transplant study to receive either single-dose Alem (30 mg intraoperatively) or multiple-dose rATG antibody induction (starting intraoperatively, minimum three doses administered) with tacrolimus\/mycophenolate \u00b1 steroids. Results: Of 222 kidney transplant patients enrolled in the study, 46 received SPKTs; 28 (61%) received Alem and 18 (39%) rATG induction. Follow-up ranged from 67 to 111 months (mean 80 months). There were no significant differences between the two groups in 5 years actual patient (86% Alem vs 89% rATG), kidney (82% Alem vs 61% rATG, p = 0.17) or pancreas (68% Alem vs 56% rATG) graft survival rates. Five years death-censored kidney (92% Alem vs 69% rATG, p = 0.09) and pancreas (76% Alem vs 56% rATG, p = 0.198) graft survival rates were slightly higher in patients receiving Alem. Acute rejection (21% Alem vs 44% rATG, p = 0.12) and major infection (39% Alem vs 67% rATG, p = 0.13) rates were slightly lower in the Alem group; cytomegalovirus infections were significantly lower (0 Alem vs 17% rATG, p = 0.05). The incidence of late acute rejection was low in both groups. There were no differences in early pancreas thrombosis (3.6% Alem vs 11% rATG), postoperative bleeding (11% Alem vs 0 rATG), other surgical complications, readmissions or freedom from steroids between groups. In patients with functioning grafts, 5 years mean serum creatinine (1.4 Alem vs 1.6 mg\/dl rATG), calculated abbreviated modification of diet in renal disease glomerular filtration rate (55 Alem vs 52 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) rATG), hemoglobin A1c (both 5.4%) and C-peptide (2.6 Alem vs 2.3 ng\/ml rATG) levels were similar. Conclusions: Single-dose Alem and multiple-dose rATG induction provide similar midterm patient survival and graft functional outcomes with no major differences in morbidity or resource utilization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073bf","authors":["Robert J Stratta","Stratta RJ","Rogers J","Orlando G","Farooq U","Al-Shraideh Y","Doares W","Kaczmorski S","Farney AC"],"doi":"10.1517\/14712598.2014.953049","first_seen_on":"2014-11-09T11:38:46+00:00","issns":["1471-2598","1744-7682"],"issue":"12","journal":"Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1415533071,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/14712598.2014.953049?ai=rw&mi=3o53wm&af=R&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed&","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/14712598.2014.953049"],"pmid":"25156622","pubdate":"2014-08-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Depleting antibody induction in simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation: a prospective single-center comparison of alemtuzumab versus rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depleting-antibody-induction-simultaneous-pancreaskidney-transplantation-prospective-singlecenter-co"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3058407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125878,"mean":8.5908062791457,"rank":84456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":29487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125878,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":673,"mean":2.1000952380952,"rank":447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":673,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":3.582,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
