This study examines how mefloquine (MF) influences central nervous control of autonomic and respiratory systems using the arterially perfused working heart brainstem preparation (WHBP) of the rat. Recordings of nerve activity were made from the thoracic sympathetic chain and phrenic nerve, while heart rate (HR) and perfusion pressure were also monitored in the arterially perfused, decerebrate, rat WHBP. MF was added to the perfusate at 1 \u03bcM to examine its effects on baseline parameters as well as baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000847","authors":["Lall, VK","Dutschmann, M","Deuchars, J","Deuchars, SA"],"doi":"10.1186\/1423-0127-19-103","first_seen_on":"2014-11-07T13:41:47+00:00","funders":["bhf","bbsrc"],"issns":["1021-7770"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Biomedical Science","last_mentioned_on":1415367085,"links":["http:\/\/eprints.whiterose.ac.uk\/81382\/"],"pmid":"23241425","pubdate":"2012-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The anti-malarial drug Mefloquine disrupts central autonomic and respiratory control in the working heart brainstem preparation of the rat.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antimalarial-drug-mefloquine-disrupts-central-autonomic-respiratory-control-working-heart-brainstem"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4478505,"mean":4.7770715355304,"rank":3447185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":132639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4478505,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125846,"mean":7.6043553418889,"rank":93132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125846,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252,"mean":2.7998645418327,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.58571428571429,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
