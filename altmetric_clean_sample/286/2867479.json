This study determined whether such pattern is also visible in schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), an animal model of ADHD. Male SHR, Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar rats were exposed to 40 sessions of SIP using a multiple fixed-time (FT) schedule of food delivery with FT 30-s and FT 90-s components. Stable performance was analyzed to determine the extent to which SIP-associated drinking is organized in bouts. The Bi-Exponential Refractory Model (BERM) of free-operant performance was applied to schedule-induced licks. A model comparison analysis supported BERM as a description of SIP episodes: licks were not produced at a constant rate but organized into bouts within drinking episodes. FT 30-s induced similar overall licking rates, latencies to first licks and episode durations across strains; FT 90-s induced longer episode durations in SHRs and reduced licking rate in WKY and Wistar rats to nearly baseline levels. Across schedules, SHRs made more and shorter bouts when compared to the other strains. These results suggest an incentive-induced hyperactivity in SHR that has been observed in operant behaviour and in children with ADHD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ad","doi":"10.1016\/j.bbr.2014.10.022","first_seen_on":"2014-11-09T21:11:54+00:00","issns":["01664328"],"journal":"Behavioural Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1415567448,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0166432814006871"],"pmid":"25447297","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"A microstructural analysis of schedule-induced polydipsia reveals incentive-induced hyperactivity in an animal model of ADHD ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microstructural-analysis-scheduleinduced-polydipsia-reveals-incentiveinduced-hyperactivity-animal-mo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4483765,"mean":4.7743486063745,"rank":3448150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":132733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4483765,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125425,"mean":7.6027204362802,"rank":92736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125425,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1587,"mean":3.1055018915511,"rank":1140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1587,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.9578787878788,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
