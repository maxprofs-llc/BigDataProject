Here we demonstrate that autonomous self-propelled millimeter sized capsules can sense the presence of pollutants, mark sites for visible identification and remove the contamination, while navigating in a complex environment of interconnected channels, the maze. Such long-range self-powered capsules propelled by the Marangoni effect are capable of releasing chemicals to alter the pH and induce aggregation during pollutant flocculation at a faster rate than convection or diffusion. These devices are foreseen to have real-world environmental applications in the near future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ac","authors":["Guanjia Zhao","Martin Pumera"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4lc00431k","first_seen_on":"2014-11-09T16:55:45+00:00","issns":["1473-0189","1473-0197"],"issue":"15","journal":"Lab on a Chip - Miniaturisation for Chemistry & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1415552130,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2014\/lc\/c4lc00431k#.VF-ccOFkI9g.twitter","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2014\/LC\/C4LC00431K"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2014\/lc\/c4lc00431k","pmid":"24903774","pubdate":"2014-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2818","subjects":["chemistry","biotechnology"],"title":"Marangoni self-propelled capsules in a maze: pollutants \u2018sense and act\u2019 in complex channel environments","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/marangoni-selfpropelled-capsules-maze-pollutants-sense-act-complex-channel-environments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6494029,"mean":5.9760756279457,"rank":4557043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1697732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6494029,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171666,"mean":8.3722823406055,"rank":107423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":56184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171666,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1985,"mean":4.1988931451613,"rank":1064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1985,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":1.8106617647059,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
