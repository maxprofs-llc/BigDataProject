Unfortunately, clinical graft manufacture using amnion can be inconsistent. Therefore, we have developed an alternative substrate, RAFT (Real Architecture for 3D Tissue), which supports human limbal epithelial cells (hLE) expansion. Epithelial organization is improved when human limbal fibroblasts (hLF) are incorporated into RAFT TE. However, hLF have the potential to trans-differentiate into a pro-scarring cell type, which would be incompatible with therapeutic transplantation. The aim of this work was to assess the scarring phenotype of hLF in RAFT TEs in hLE+ and hLE- RAFT TEs and in non-airlifted and airlifted RAFT TEs. Diseased fibroblasts (dFib) isolated from the fibrotic conjunctivae of ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid patients were used as a pro-scarring positive control against which hLF were compared using surrogate scarring parameters: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, de novo collagen synthesis, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) secretion. Normal hLF and dFib maintained different phenotypes in RAFT TE. MMP-2 and -9 activity, de novo collagen synthesis and \u03b1-SMA expression were all increased in dFib cf. normal hLF RAFT TEs, although TGF-\u03b21 secretion did not differ between normal hLF and dFib RAFT TEs. Normal hLF do not progress towards a scarring-like phenotype during culture in RAFT TEs and therefore may be safe to include in therapeutic RAFT TE, where they can support hLE, although in vivo work is required to confirm this. dFib RAFT TEs (used here as a positive control) may be useful towards development of an ex vivo disease model of Oc-MMP.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b99","authors":["Isobel Massie","Sarah Barbara Dale","Julie T Daniels"],"doi":"10.1089\/ten.tec.2014.0458","first_seen_on":"2014-11-08T12:41:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1937-3392"],"journal":"Tissue Engineering Part C: Methods","last_mentioned_on":1415512192,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25380529?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25380529"],"pmid":"25380529","pubdate":"2014-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["histology","biotechnology"],"title":"Limbal fibroblasts maintain normal phenotype in 3D RAFT tissue equivalents suggesting potential for safe clinical use in treatment of ocular surface failure.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/limbal-fibroblasts-maintain-normal-phenotype-3d-raft-tissue-equivalents-suggesting-potential-safe-cl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508238,"mean":5.1674528195662,"rank":2121608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2252418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508238,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126357,"mean":8.7158558833774,"rank":57388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":63690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126357,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":5.1842597402597,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":16.051692307692,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
