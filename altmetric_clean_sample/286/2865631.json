The aim of this study was to assess in parasitized minced fish the effect of the washing steps on the allergen removal of Anisakis simplex and on protein yield during surimi processing. Experimentally infected hake (Merluccius merluccius) (50 Anisakis simplex s.s L3 larvae per 100\u2009g of muscle) underwent three successive washing steps with water, phosphate buffer (20 mM), sodium bicarbonate (60 mM), or sodium hypochlorite (0.27 mM) in the surimi processing (4\u2009kg muscle, 1:4\u2009w\/v for each solution). Total protein concentration and A. simplex antigens and allergens were evaluated in each waste fraction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ee9","authors":["Fabiola Olivares","Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez-Mu\u00f1oz","Noelia Carballeda-Sangiao","Ana Rodr\u00edguez-Mahillo","Mercedes Careche","Cristina de Las Heras","Alfonso Navas","Margarita Tejada"],"doi":"10.1002\/jsfa.6994","first_seen_on":"2014-11-08T16:19:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1097-0010"],"journal":"Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture","last_mentioned_on":1464896335,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25378259?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25378259","pubdate":"2014-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Removal of Anisakis simplex allergens from infected fish during the washing step of surimi production.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/removal-anisakis-simplex-allergens-infected-fish-during-washing-step-surimi-production"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":3647538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4023973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203434,"mean":7.8650235802453,"rank":82142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":114528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203434,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1339,"mean":3.000023916293,"rank":544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1339,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":2.5122448979592,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
