Osteocytes are the primary mechanical sensors in bone, upregulating osteogenic factors and down regulating osteoinhibitors, and recruiting osteoclasts to resorb bone in response to microdamage accumulation. However, most of the cell populations of the bone marrow niche, which are intimately involved with bone remodeling as the source of bone osteoblast and osteoclast progenitors, are also mechanosensitive. We hypothesized that the deformation of trabecular bone would impart mechanical stress within the entrapped bone marrow consistent with mechanostimulation of the constituent cells. Detailed fluid structure interaction models of porcine femoral trabecular bone and bone marrow were created using tetrahedral finite element meshes. The marrow was allowed to flow freely within the bone pores, while the bone was compressed to 2000 or 3000 microstrain at the apparent level. Marrow properties were parametrically varied from a constant 400 mPa-s to a power-law rule exceeding 85 Pa-s. Deformation generated almost no shear stress or pressure in the marrow for the low viscosity fluid, but exceeded 5 Pa when the higher viscosity models were used. The shear stress was higher when the strain rate increased and in higher volume fraction bone. The results demonstrate that cells within the trabecular bone marrow could be mechanically stimulated by bone deformation, depending on deformation rate, bone porosity, and bone marrow properties. Since the marrow contains many mechanosensitive cells, changes in the stimulatory levels may explain the alterations in bone marrow morphology with aging and disease, which may in turn affect the trabecular bone mechanobiology and adaptation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cce","authors":["Metzger TA","Kreipke TC","Vaughan TJ","McNamara L","Niebur GL"],"doi":"10.1115\/1.4028985","first_seen_on":"2014-11-10T08:25:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0148-0731"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Biomechanical Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1415608175,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25363343"],"pmid":"25363343","pubdate":"2014-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"The in situ Mechanics of Trabecular Bone Marrow: The Potential for Mechanobiological Response.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/situ-mechanics-trabecular-bone-marrow-potential-mechanobiological-response"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4488773,"mean":4.773261823621,"rank":3449604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":132886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4488773,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124395,"mean":7.59459478753,"rank":91889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124395,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":0.9918115942029,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
