One of the best strategies to counteract plasmid loss is the use of auxotrophic mutants which are complemented with the lacking gene along with the product-relevant ones. However, these knockout mutants often show unwanted growth in complex standard media or no growth at all under uncomplemented conditions. This led to the choice of a gene for knockout that only connects two essential arms of an essential metabolic pathway - the glycolysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086e","authors":["Ram S Velur Selvamani","Maurice Telaar","Karl Friehs","Erwin Flaschel","Ram Shankar Velur Selvamani"],"doi":"10.1186\/1475-2859-13-58","first_seen_on":"2014-11-10T12:04:10+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1475-2859"],"issue":"1","journal":"Microbial Cell Factories","last_mentioned_on":1415491260,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1475-2859-13-58"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.microbialcellfactories.com\/content\/pdf\/1475-2859-13-58.pdf","pmid":"24745552","pubdate":"2014-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Engineering\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"58","subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Antibiotic-free segregational plasmid stabilization in Escherichia coli owing to the knockout of triosephosphate isomerase (tpiA)","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibioticfree-segregational-plasmid-stabilization-escherichia-coli-owing-knockout-triosephosphate-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4480293,"mean":4.7754720890869,"rank":538254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3915865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4480293,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124289,"mean":7.6173314076983,"rank":20242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":102818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124289,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313,"mean":2.4558076923077,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.6867,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
