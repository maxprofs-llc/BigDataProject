However, it is not well understood which plant traits determine these ecological effects. We explored the effect of intraspecific chemical diversity among neighbouring plants on the associated invertebrate community and plant traits. In a common garden experiment, intraspecific diversity among neighbouring plants was manipulated using three plant populations of wild cabbage that differ in foliar glucosinolates. Plants were larger, harboured more herbivores, but were less damaged when plant diversity was increased. Glucosinolate concentration differentially correlated with generalist and specialist herbivore abundance. Glucosinolate composition correlated with plant damage, while in polycultures, variation in glucosinolate concentrations among neighbouring plants correlated positively with herbivore diversity and negatively with plant damage levels. The results suggest that intraspecific variation in secondary chemistry among neighbouring plants is important in determining the structure of the associated insect community and positively affects plant performance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002767","authors":["Bustos\u2010Segura, Carlos","Poelman, Erik H.","Reichelt, Michael","Gershenzon, Jonathan","Gols, Rieta"],"doi":"10.1111\/ele.12713","endpage":"97","first_seen_on":"2016-12-25T07:57:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1461-0248","1461023X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Ecology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1487203200,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fele.12713#.WF93mKeevkw.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ele.12713\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ele.12713\/abstract;jsessionid=34B882470D34BB1B246CC950187A9149.f01t02","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/ele.12713"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ele.12713\/pdf","pmid":"28000435","pubdate":"2016-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecological Applications","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"87","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Intraspecific chemical diversity among neighbouring plants correlates positively with plant size and herbivore load but negatively with herbivore damage","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/ele.12713","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intraspecific-chemical-diversity-among-neighbouring-plants-correlates-positively-plant-size-herbivor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.85,"score_history":{"1y":6.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":1273176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6937403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266643,"mean":12.389683013178,"rank":60433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":206087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266643,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1667,"mean":17.584180072029,"rank":843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1667,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":31.242745098039,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
