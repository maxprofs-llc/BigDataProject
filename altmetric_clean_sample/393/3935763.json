In contrast, syngeneic skin grafts are tolerated, and gray hair grows on the grafts.\nTo explore the mechanism of gray hair growing on the tolerated skin grafts, we prepared full-thickness skin (2-cm square) autografts, 2 (2 cm + 2 cm) horizontal or vertical parallel incisions, and U-shaped (2 cm \u00d7 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm) flaps with or without pedicle vessels. The grafts, incisions, and flaps were fixed by suturing with string and protected by a transparent bandage. On day 14 after the operation, the bandages were removed to observe the color of the hair growing on the skin.\nSkin autografts from wild-type or hepatocyte growth factor-transgenic (Tg) C57BL\/6 mice survived with gray hair, whereas those from steel factor (Kitl)-Tg C57BL\/6 mice survived with black hair. In addition, U-shaped flaps lacking both of the 2 main feeding vessels of wild-type mice had gray hair at the tip of the flaps. Light microscopy after staining with hematoxylin and eosin or dihydroxyphenylalanine showed that the formation of melanin pigment in the follicles, but not in the interadnexal skin, was susceptible to the blood supply.\nMelanin pigment formation in the hair bulb melanocytes appeared to be susceptible to the blood supply, and melanocytosis was promoted in the follicles and in the epidermis of Kitl-Tg C57BL\/6 mice.","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb32a83ee005f8b4574","authors":["Maeda, Shogo","Ueda, Koichi","Yamana, Hidenori","Tashiro-Yamaji, Junko","Ibata, Minenori","Mikura, Ayako","Okada, Masashi","Yasuda, Emi","Shibayama, Yuro","Yoshino, Miya","Kubota, Takahiro","Yoshida, Ryotaro"],"doi":"10.1097\/gox.0000000000000284","first_seen_on":"2015-04-23T16:06:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2169-7574"],"issue":"3","journal":"PRS Global Open","last_mentioned_on":1429808997,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/prsgo\/Fulltext\/2015\/03000\/Blood_Supply__Susceptible_Formation_of_Melanin.13.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/prsgo\/2015\/03000\/Blood_Supply__Susceptible_Formation_of_Melanin.13.pdf","pmid":"25878939","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"e328","title":"Blood Supply--Susceptible Formation of Melanin Pigment in Hair Bulb Melanocytes of Mice","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blood-supplysusceptible-formation-melanin-pigment-hair-bulb-melanocytes-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5030622,"mean":5.9580818173371,"rank":3558393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":824866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5030622,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156536,"mean":9.7428574312456,"rank":115164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156536,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308,"mean":5.6083061889251,"rank":287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":5.2845915492958,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/prsjournal\/status\/591271626810920961","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3935763],"posted_on":"2015-04-23T16:05:15+00:00","author":{"name":"PRS|PRS Global Open","url":"http:\/\/www.prsglobalopen.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/863037398313193474\/uO2dXqv7_normal.jpg","description":"Official Twitter of #PRS & #PRSGlobalOpen, American Society of Plastic Surgeons journals. #PRSJournalClub #PRSGrandRounds #PlasticSurgery #AestheticSurgery","id_on_source":"prsjournal","tweeter_id":"33619885","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":13570},"tweet_id":"591271626810920961"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OlivierBranford\/status\/591287906444120065","license":"datasift","rt":["prsjournal"],"citation_ids":[3935763],"posted_on":"2015-04-23T17:09:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Olivier Branford","url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/?term=branford+oa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/794566336965910528\/KJC2WXt4_normal.jpg","description":"Plastic Surgeon PhD FRCS(Plast) \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7Reconstructive #PlasticSurgery Assoc Editor #PRSGlobalOpen @ASPS_News Committee Member","id_on_source":"OlivierBranford","tweeter_id":"1939065583","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":156120},"tweet_id":"591287906444120065"}]}}
