We hypothesize that the PDB contains valuable quantitative information on the level of local tertiary structural motifs (TERMs). We show that by breaking a protein structure into its constituent TERMs, and querying the PDB to characterize the natural ensemble matching each, we can estimate the compatibility of the structure with a given amino acid sequence through a metric we term \"structure score.\" Considering submissions from recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments, we found a strong correlation (R\u00a0= 0.69) between structure score and model accuracy, with poorly predicted regions readily identifiable. This performance exceeds that of leading atomistic statistical energy functions. Furthermore, TERM-based analysis of two prototypical multi-state proteins rapidly produced structural insights fully consistent with prior extensive experimental studies. We thus find that TERM-based analysis should have considerable utility for protein structural biology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035d2","authors":["Zheng, Fan","Zhang, Jian","Grigoryan, Gevorg"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.str.2015.03.015","first_seen_on":"2015-04-23T23:06:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0969-2126","09692126","1878-4186"],"journal":"Structure","last_mentioned_on":1434321366,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0969212615001197","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fstructure%2Fabstract%2FS0969-2126%252815%252900119-7&code=cell-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0969212615001197?via=ihub","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fstructure%2Fabstract%2FS0969-2126%252815%252900119-7%3Felsca1%3Detoc%26elsca2%3Demail%26elsca3%3D0969-2126_20150505_23_5_%26elsca4%3DCell%2BPress&code=cell-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0969212615001197\/pdf","pmid":"25914055","pubdate":"2015-04-29T22:05:41+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Tertiary Structural Propensities Reveal Fundamental Sequence\/Structure Relationships","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tertiary-structural-propensities-reveal-fundamental-sequencestructure-relationships"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.258,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.258},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5229325,"mean":6.1628027251727,"rank":564780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4664460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5229325,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159477,"mean":9.8175365948483,"rank":27352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":132118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159477,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1591,"mean":3.8435509433962,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1591,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":4.11,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
