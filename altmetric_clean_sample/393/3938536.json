We assessed the relationship between self-reported maternal dietary vitamin D intake during pregnancy and the risk of dental caries among young Japanese children.\nThis study is based on a prospective analysis of 1210 Japanese mother-child pairs. Information on maternal intake during pregnancy was collected using a validated diet history questionnaire. Data on oral examination at 36-46\u00a0months of age were obtained from the mothers, who transcribed the information from their maternal and child health handbooks to our self-administered questionnaire. Children were classified as having dental caries if one or more primary teeth had decayed or had been filled.\nCompared with the lowest quartile of maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy, adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for quartiles 2, 3, and 4 were 1.06 (0.72-1.56), 0.53 (0.34-0.81), and 0.67 (0.44-1.02), respectively (P for trend\u00a0=\u00a0.01). When maternal vitamin D intake was treated as a continuous variable, the adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.94 (0.89-0.995).\nHigher maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy may be associated with a lower risk of dental caries in children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002276","authors":["Tanaka, Keiko","Hitsumoto, Shinichi","Miyake, Yoshihiro","Okubo, Hitomi","Sasaki, Satoshi","Miyatake, Nobuyuki","Arakawa, Masashi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.annepidem.2015.03.020","first_seen_on":"2015-04-24T12:01:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1047-2797","1873-2585"],"journal":"Annals of Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1490813872,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1047279715001349","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25956333","http:\/\/www.annalsofepidemiology.org\/article\/S1047-2797%2815%2900134-9\/abstract","http:\/\/www.annalsofepidemiology.org\/article\/S1047-2797(15)00134-9\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25956333?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25956333"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.annalsofepidemiology.org\/article\/S1047279715001349\/pdf","pmid":"25956333","pubdate":"2015-05-10T22:02:30+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Higher vitamin D intake during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of dental caries in young Japanese children","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/higher-vitamin-d-intake-during-pregnancy-associated-reduced-risk-dental-caries-young-japanese-childr-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":1934729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6480019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208535,"mean":9.1173148071778,"rank":57594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":150302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208535,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1105,"mean":7.8192572463768,"rank":348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1105,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":8.8952727272727,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
