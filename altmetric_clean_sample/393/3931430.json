It is also unclear whether surgical endovascular treatment may improve or worsen the headache, and if there are predictable factors for headache outcome such as pre-existing headache features, aneurysm characteristics, or other medical history. There is debate regarding safe treatment of migraine in patients with aneurysms, both before and after endovascular treatments. Particularly, there is hesitancy to use the triptans and ergot derivatives such as dihydroergotamine because of their vasoconstrictive effects and concern for adverse events related to the aneurysm such as aneurysmal instability and rupture.\nTo review the literature regarding the anatomy, pathophysiology, and association between headache, untreated vs surgically treated aneurysms, and the use of triptans and ergot derivatives for migraine treatment in this setting.\nAssociations between some headaches and aneurysms may exist. Some chronic headaches may respond to surgical aneurysm repair while others may worsen. These associations are undefined by current literature because of variable results, study methods, and limited data. Prospective studies are needed which incorporate pre- and post-procedure headache character and diagnosis, aneurysm characteristics, type of aneurysm repair, associated risk factors for worsening post-procedure headache, and ultimately combining all of these data to better predict headache outcome following surgical aneurysm treatment. Lastly, the caution and avoidance of triptan and ergot derivative use for migraine in the setting of aneurysm is not supported by the current evidence, and much of this concern may be excessive and unwarranted, although more evidence confirming safety is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029b5","authors":["Baron, Eric P."],"doi":"10.1111\/head.12562","endpage":"747","first_seen_on":"2015-04-22T14:34:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1526-4610"],"issue":"5","journal":"Headache: The Journal of Head & Face Pain","last_mentioned_on":1429715999,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/head.12562\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/head.12562\/pdf","pmid":"25903747","pubdate":"2015-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"739","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Headache, Cerebral Aneurysms, and the Use of Triptans and Ergot Derivatives","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/headache-cerebral-aneurysms-triptans-ergot-derivatives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6364891,"mean":5.983222731579,"rank":2751541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3560045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6364891,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164240,"mean":9.7673539902216,"rank":83297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":79272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164240,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1156,"mean":6.2599670995671,"rank":718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1156,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":5.764,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
