Physical dose distributions were evaluated as well as the resulting NTCP values, using modern models for acute mucositis, xerostomia, aspiration, dysphagia, laryngeal edema, and trismus. Patient subgroups were defined based on primary tumor location.\nGenerally, IMPT reduced the NTCP values while keeping similar target coverage for all patients. Subgroup analyses revealed a higher individual reduction of swallowing-related side effects by IMPT for patients with tumors in the upper head and neck area, whereas the risk reduction of acute mucositis was more pronounced in patients with tumors in the larynx region. More patients with tumors in the upper head and neck area had a reduction in NTCP of more than 10%.\nSubgrouping can help to identify patients who may benefit more than others from the use of IMPT and, thus, can be a useful tool for a preselection of patients in the clinic where there are limited PT resources. Because the individual benefit differs within a subgroup, the relative merits should additionally be evaluated by individual treatment plan comparisons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b96","authors":["Jakobi, Annika","Bandurska-Luque, Anna","St\u00fctzer, Kristin","Haase, Robert","L\u00f6ck, Steffen","Wack, Linda-Jacqueline","M\u00f6nnich, David","Thorwarth, Daniela","Perez, Damien","L\u00fchr, Armin","Zips, Daniel","Krause, Mechthild","Baumann, Michael","Perrin, Rosalind","Richter, Christian"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijrobp.2015.04.031","first_seen_on":"2015-04-24T08:54:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0360-3016","1879-355X"],"issue":"5","journal":"International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics","last_mentioned_on":1429911815,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.redjournal.org%2Farticle%2FS0360-3016%252815%252900431-9%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=rob-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.redjournal.org\/article\/S0360301615004319\/pdf","pmid":"26194685","pubdate":"2015-07-22T22:01:50+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["radiology","neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Identification of patient benefit from proton therapy for advanced head and neck cancer patients based on individual and subgroup NTCP analysis","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-patient-benefit-proton-therapy-advanced-head-neck-cancer-patients-based-individual-su-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033253,"mean":5.9592311638698,"rank":2497101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2383349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033253,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156572,"mean":9.7012084102421,"rank":83144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":66465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156572,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3546,"mean":2.2340750352609,"rank":1053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3546,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":3.2034090909091,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
