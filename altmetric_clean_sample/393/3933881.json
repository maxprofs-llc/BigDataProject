Seventy-two participants either completed the public-speaking component of the TSST or, as a control condition, the friendly TSST (Wiemers, Schoofs, & Wolf, 2013) and wrote picture stories both before and after treatment. Stories were coded for motivational imagery related to power, achievement, and affiliation as well as for activity inhibition, a marker of functional brain lateralization during stress. The TSST had a specific arousing effect on power motivation, but not on other motivational needs, on activity inhibition, or on story length. TSST-elicited increases in power imagery, but not in achievement or affiliation imagery, were associated with a relatively greater salivary alpha-amylase response and with a relatively lesser salivary cortisol response. These findings suggest that the TSST specifically induces power-related stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029fe","authors":["Wiemers, Uta S","Schultheiss, Oliver C","Wolf, Oliver T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yhbeh.2015.04.007","first_seen_on":"2015-04-23T05:17:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0018506X","1095-6867"],"journal":"Hormones & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1448312548,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0018506X15000574","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25913901"],"pmid":"25913901","pubdate":"2015-04-29T22:06:02+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","endocrinology"],"title":"Public speaking in front of an unreceptive audience increases implicit power motivation and its endocrine arousal signature.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/public-speaking-front-unreceptive-audience-increases-implicit-power-motivation-endocrine-arousal-sig"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7374182,"mean":6.407190734262,"rank":3244725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4057458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7374182,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201790,"mean":8.8751275342067,"rank":86598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":111529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201790,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":997,"mean":8.6950200803213,"rank":612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":997,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":9.0631,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
