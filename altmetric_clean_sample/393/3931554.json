Systems based on information and communication technology (ICT) for supporting lifestyle modification and self-management of diabetes are promising tools for helping patients better cope with diabetes. An earlier study had determined that diet improved and HbA1c declined for the patients who had used DialBetics during a 3-month randomized clinical trial. The objective of the current study was to test a more patient-friendly version of DialBetics, whose development was based on the original participants' feedback about the previous version of DialBetics.\nDialBetics comprises 4 modules: data transmission, evaluation, exercise input, and food recording and dietary evaluation. Food recording uses a multimedia food record, FoodLog. A 1-week pilot study was designed to determine if usability and compliance improved over the previous version, especially with the new meal-input function.\nIn the earlier 3-month, diet-evaluation study, HbA1c had declined a significant 0.4% among those who used DialBetics compared with the control group. In the current 1-week study, input of meal photos was higher than with the previous version (84.8 \u00b1 13.2% vs 77.1% \u00b1 35.1% in the first 2 weeks of the 3-month trial). Interviews after the 1-week study showed that 4 of the 5 participants thought the meal-input function improved; the fifth found input easier, but did not consider the result an improvement.\nDialBetics with FoodLog was shown to be an effective and convenient tool, its new meal-photo input function helping provide patients with real-time support for diet modification.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c3b","authors":["Waki, Kayo","Aizawa, Kiyoharu","Kato, Shigeko","Fujita, Hideo","Lee, Hanae","Kobayashi, Haruka","Ogawa, Makoto","Mouri, Keisuke","Kadowaki, Takashi","Ohe, Kazuhiko"],"doi":"10.1177\/1932296815579690","first_seen_on":"2015-04-22T15:15:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-2968"],"journal":"Journal of Diabetes Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1429715714,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25883164"],"pmid":"25883164","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"DialBetics With a Multimedia Food Recording Tool, FoodLog: Smartphone-Based Self-Management for Type 2 Diabetes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dialbetics-multimedia-food-recording-tool-foodlog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5026115,"mean":5.9535157984903,"rank":3555209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":823967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5026115,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155349,"mean":9.7847695754051,"rank":114295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155349,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":342,"mean":5.1427331378299,"rank":245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":342,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":6.4055555555556,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
