These animals tend to exhibit sedentary habits. Here, we show that a combination of wide housing space and training exercise helps to reduce white adipose mass and to increase brown adipose mass. Thus, this combination is a useful strategy for truly enhancing the physical fitness of captive rats commonly used in exercise-related interventional studies and to maximize their welfare.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000ceb","authors":[" Pedro Paulo Menezes Scariot"],"doi":"10.1139\/apnm-2014-0416","first_seen_on":"2015-04-24T15:33:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1715-5320"],"journal":"Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1431426992,"links":["http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/apnm-2014-0416","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25906078"],"pmid":"25906078","pubdate":"2015-04-24T22:00:39+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","metabolism","sportsmedicine","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Wide housing space and chronic exercise enhance physical fitness and adipose tissue morphology in rats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wide-housing-space-chronic-exercise-enhance-physical-fitness-adipose-tissue-morphology-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5090501,"mean":6.0303787922621,"rank":3362694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1516279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5090501,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157321,"mean":9.7305523518943,"rank":106649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":43273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157321,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":849,"mean":11.321481132075,"rank":623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":849,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":13.76856,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
