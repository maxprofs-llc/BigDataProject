We also analyzed the correlations between the expression level of miR-31 and the clinical characteristics in cases of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, we measured the expression of miR-31 in cervical cancer cell lines, and transfected HPV16 E6 siRNA and HPV16 E7 siRNA into SiHa cells to investigate the effects on miR-31. Finally, the effects of miR-31 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were measured in HeLa and SiHa cells that were transfected with a miR-31 mimic or a negative control.\nWe found that the expression level of miR-31 was significantly higher in cervical cancer patients than in normal individuals (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Aberrant expression of miR-31 was positively correlated with the lymph node metastasis (LNM), vessel invasion and HPV status (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Additionally, miR-31 was also overexpressed in the cervical cancer-derived HeLa and SiHa cells compared with C33A cells (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, a relationship was found between miR-31 expression and the HPV16 oncoproteins E6\/E7. Furthermore, we found that the overexpression of miR-31 can promote cell proliferation and enhance the migration and invasion abilities of cancer cells.\nOur results suggested that miR-31 plays an oncogenetic role in the development and progression of cervical cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002306","authors":["Zheng, Wenjing","Liu, Zhen","Zhang, Wei","Hu, Xiaoxia"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00404-015-3713-2","first_seen_on":"2015-04-23T09:31:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0711"],"journal":"Archives of Gynecology & Obstetrics","last_mentioned_on":1429781467,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25894339?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25894339","pubdate":"2015-04-23T22:11:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Obstetrics\/Perinatology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"miR-31 functions as an oncogene in cervical cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir31-functions-oncogene-cervical-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5030622,"mean":5.9580818173371,"rank":4205746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5030622,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156533,"mean":9.7430259499657,"rank":131130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156533,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":673,"mean":2.1139910714286,"rank":435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":673,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.0578947368421,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/status\/591172436948717568","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3934427],"posted_on":"2015-04-23T09:31:07+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
