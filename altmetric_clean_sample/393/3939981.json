The present report refers to a case of a 7-year-old male child presenting an extensive skin lesion that began when he was 5 years of age. Two biopsies were evaluated using the CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, \u03b2F1, and TIA markers. A dense infiltrate of CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, CD56-, \u03b2F1+, and TIA+ pleomorphic lymphocytes was found in the subcutis. The previous biopsy showed cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis with a small focus on CD8+ and \u03b2F1+ malignant cells. The lesion regressed spontaneously. This case shows that prognosis may be excellent in SPTL (\u03b1\/\u03b2). On the other hand, it also serves as an alert that a biopsy performed in an area of cytophagic panniculitis may lead to misdiagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7ee3cf058f61000b630","authors":["Bittencourt, Achil\u00e9a L."],"doi":"10.1155\/2011\/639240","first_seen_on":"2015-04-24T19:58:42+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2090-6706","2090-6714"],"journal":"Case Reports in Oncological Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1429913963,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/crionm\/2011\/639240\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/crionm\/2011\/639240.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3350120","pmid":"22606445","pubdate":"2011-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Subcutaneous Panniculitis-Like T-Cell Lymphoma (SPTL) in a Child with Spontaneous Resolution","type":"article","volume":"2011","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subcutaneous-panniculitislike-tcell-lymphoma-sptl-child-spontaneous-resolution"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033259,"mean":5.9592378650214,"rank":3356616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1473449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033259,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156550,"mean":9.7023475205848,"rank":107895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":41427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156550,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":0.84782608695652,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
