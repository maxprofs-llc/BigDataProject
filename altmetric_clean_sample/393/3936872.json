Herein we report that TAp63\u03b3 and \u0394Np63\u03b2 appear to be an integral part of the osteoblastic differentiation of hMSC and are differentially regulated by the vitamin D3 metabolites 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 and 24R,25(OH)2D3. We compared the endogenous expression of p63 isoforms (TA- and \u0394Np63) and splice variants (p63\u03b1, -\u03b2, -\u03b3), in naive hMSC and during osteoblastic differentiation of hMSC. TAp63\u03b1 and -\u03b2 were the predominant p63 variants in naive, proliferating hMSC. In contrast, under osteoblastic differentiation conditions, expression of p63 changed from the TAp63\u03b1 and -\u03b2 to the TAp63\u03b3 and \u0394Np63\u03b2 variants. Transient overexpression of the p63 variants demonstrated that TAp63\u03b2, \u0394Np63\u03b2, and \u0394Np63\u03b3 increased alkaline phosphatase activity and \u0394Np63\u03b1 and -\u03b3 increased the expression of mRNA for osteocalcin and osterix. Our results support the hypothesis that TAp63\u03b1 and -\u03b2 promote a naive state in hMSC. Moreover, TAp63\u03b3 is increased during and promotes early osteoblastic differentiation through the expression of pro-osteogenic genes; VDR, Osterix, Runx2 and Osteopontin. \u0394Np63\u03b2 also appears to support osteogenic maturation through increased alkaline phosphatase activity. Treatment with 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 increased the expression of mRNA for \u0394Np63, while addition of 24R,25(OH)2D3 increased the expression of TA- and \u0394Np63\u03b3 variants. These novel findings demonstrate for the first time that p63 variants are differentially expressed in naive hMSC (TAp63\u03b1,\u03b2), are important during the osteoblastic differentiation of hMSC (TAp63\u03b3 and \u0394Np63\u03b2), and are differentially regulated by the vitamin D3 metabolites, 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 and 24R,25(OH)2D3. The molecular nuances and mechanisms of osteoblastic differentiation presented here will hopefully improve our understanding of bone development, complications in bone repair (mal- and non-union fractures), osteoporosis and possibly lead to new modalities of treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Kevin M.
