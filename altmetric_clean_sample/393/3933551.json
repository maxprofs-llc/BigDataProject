The aim of this paper is to develop a risk advisor model to predict the chances of diabetes complications according to the changes in risk factors. As the starting point, an inclusive list of (k) diabetes complications and (n) their correlated predisposing factors are derived from the existing endocrinology text books. A type of data meta-analysis has been done to extract and combine the numeric value of the relationships between these two. The whole n (risk factors) - k (complications) model was broken down into k different (n-1) relationships and these (n-1) dependencies were broken into n (1-1) models. Applying regression analysis (seven patterns) and artificial neural networks (ANN), we created models to show the (1-1) correspondence between factors and complications. Then all 1-1 models related to an individual complication were integrated using the na\u00efve Bayes theorem. Finally, a Bayesian belief network was developed to show the influence of all risk factors and complications on each other. We assessed the predictive power of the 1-1 models by R2, F-ratio and adjusted R2 equations; sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were calculated to evaluate the final model using real patient data. The results suggest that the best fitted regression models outperform the predictive ability of an ANN model, as well as six other regression patterns for all 1-1 models.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Mohsen Sangi","Khin Than Win","Farid Shirvani","Mohammad-Reza Namazi-Rad","Nagesh Shukla"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0121569","first_seen_on":"2015-04-23T03:05:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1430436427,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0121569"],"pmid":"25902317","pubdate":"2015-04-23T22:00:27+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Applying a Novel Combination of Techniques to Develop a Predictive Model for Diabetes Complications","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/applying-novel-combination-techniques-develop-predictive-model-diabetes-complications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5042185,"mean":5.9754557227593,"rank":1844019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3173612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5042185,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155900,"mean":9.7615690671526,"rank":55377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":99435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155900,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89106,"mean":9.2884161382639,"rank":29848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":58756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89106,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5440,"mean":8.5829498069498,"rank":1854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5440,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
