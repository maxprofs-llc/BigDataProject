Outcomes possibly attributable to RBC transfusions were looked for daily. In transfused cases, it was considered that an outcome was associated with a transfusion only if it was observed after the first RBC transfusion. During the 1-year study period, 913 consecutive admissions were documented, 842 of which were included. Among them, 144 (17%) were transfused at least once. When comparing transfused cases with nontransfused cases, the odds ratio for new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was 2.39 (95% CI, 1.58-3.62; p < 0.001). This association remained statistically significant in the multivariable analysis for children with admission Pediatric Risk of Mortality score up to 5 (odds ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.08-5.37; p = 0.032). Transfused cases were ventilated longer than nontransfused cases (14.1 \u00b1 32.6 d vs 4.3 \u00b1 9.6 d; p < 0.001), even after adjustment in a Cox model. The PICU length of stay was significantly increased for transfused cases (12.4 \u00b1 26.2 d vs 4.9 \u00b1 10.2 d; p < 0.001), even after controlling for potential confounders. The paired analysis for comparison of pretransfusion and posttransfusion values showed that the arterial partial pressure in oxygen was significantly reduced after the first RBC transfusion (mean difference, 42.8 torr; 95% CI, 27.2-58.3; p < 0.001). The paired analysis also showed an increased proportion of renal replacement therapy.\nRBC transfusions in critically ill children were associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and prolonged PICU stay. The risk of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was also increased in some transfused children. Furthermore, our study questions the ability of stored RBCs to improve oxygenation in critically ill children. Practitioners should take into account these data when prescribing an RBC transfusion to PICU patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008484","authors":["Demaret, Pierre","Tucci, Marisa","Karam, Oliver","Trottier, Helen","Ducruet, Thierry","Lacroix, Jacques"],"doi":"10.1097\/pcc.0000000000000423","first_seen_on":"2015-04-23T21:58:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1529-7535"],"issue":"6","journal":"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1481693481,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Clinical_Outcomes_Associated_With_RBC_Transfusions.98955.aspx","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/_layouts\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?article=98955&issue=00000&year=9000#ath","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/9000\/00000\/Clinical_Outcomes_Associated_With_RBC_Transfusions.98955.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25905491#","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25905491","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&amp;issue=00000&amp;article=98961&amp;type=abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Abstract\/2015\/07000\/Clinical_Outcomes_Associated_With_RBC_Transfusions.2.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Fulltext\/2015\/07000\/Clinical_Outcomes_Associated_With_RBC_Transfusions.2.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/9000\/00000\/Clinical_Outcomes_Associated_With_RBC_Transfusions.98955.pdf","pmid":"25905491","pubdate":"2015-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare","pediatrics"],"title":"Clinical Outcomes Associated With RBC Transfusions in Critically Ill Children: A 1-Year Prospective Study*","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-outcomes-associated-rbc-transfusions-critically-ill-children-1year-prospective-study-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.4,"score_history":{"1y":0.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7885400,"mean":6.6781117138083,"rank":471826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7413094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7885400,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205342,"mean":8.9443672622613,"rank":18358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":186959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205342,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2064,"mean":2.2515298109549,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":2040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2064,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":1.6461538461538,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3,"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MY":1,"US":4,"ES":1,"AE":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PedCritCareMed\/status\/591360513121984512","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3936648],"posted_on":"2015-04-23T21:58:27+00:00","author":{"name":"PCCM","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000851598361\/37fe116807faf804d7b38b36804903df_normal.jpeg","description":"\"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine\" is written for the entire multidisciplinary team.
