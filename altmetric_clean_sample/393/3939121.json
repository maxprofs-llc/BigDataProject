The etiology of late-onset Alzheimer's disease is not based on mutations related to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) or tau production which are currently the basis of in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease. It has recently been suggested that mechanisms like chronic neuroinflammation may occur prior to amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathologies in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study is to analyze the characteristics of rodent models of neuroinflammation in late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Our search criteria were based on characteristics of an idealistic disease model that should recapitulate causes, symptoms, and lesions in a chronological order similar to the actual disease. Therefore, a model based on the inflammation hypothesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease should include the following features: (i) primary chronic neuroinflammation, (ii) manifestations of memory and cognitive impairment, and (iii) late development of tau and A\u03b2 pathologies. The following models fit the pre-defined criteria: lipopolysaccharide- and PolyI:C-induced models of immune challenge; streptozotocin-, okadaic acid-, and colchicine neurotoxin-induced neuroinflammation models, as well as interleukin-1\u03b2, anti-nerve growth factor and p25 transgenic models. Among these models, streptozotocin, PolyI:C-induced, and p25 neuroinflammation models are compatible with the inflammation hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000085d","authors":["Nazem, Amir","Sankowski, Roman","Bacher, Michael","Al-Abed, Yousef","Amir Nazem","Roman Sankowski","Michael Bacher","Yousef Al-Abed"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12974-015-0291-y","first_seen_on":"2015-04-24T14:44:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1742-2094"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Neuroinflammation","last_mentioned_on":1429833600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25890375","https:\/\/jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12974-015-0291-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12974-015-0291-y?site=jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"25890375","pubdate":"2015-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"74","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Rodent models of neuroinflammation for Alzheimer's disease.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rodent-models-neuroinflammation-alzheimers-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6522531,"mean":6.0396109718143,"rank":864921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5604150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6522531,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172937,"mean":9.6547668732944,"rank":35737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":135510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172937,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":906,"mean":4.2749325966851,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":906,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":4.3191818181818,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
