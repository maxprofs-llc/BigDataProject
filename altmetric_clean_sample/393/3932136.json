Here is a new one about the evolution of viviparity.","Today I learned there are viviparous flies. Wat.","Bioessay on evolution of live birth"],"citation":{"abstract":"I propose that the underlying adaptation enabling the reproductive strategy of birthing live young (viviparity) is retraction of the site of fertilization within the female reproductive tract, and that this evolved as a means of postcopulatory sexual selection. There are three conspicuous aspects associated with viviparity: (i) internal development is a complex trait often accompanied by a suite of secondary adaptations, yet it is unclear how the intermediate state of this trait - egg retention - could have evolved; (ii) viviparity often results in a reduction in fecundity; (iii) viviparity has evolved independently many times across a diverse array of animal groups. Focusing on the Diptera (true flies), I provide explanations for these observations. I further propose that fecundity is not traded-off to enable potential benefits of viviparity, but rather that loss of fecundity is directly selected and egg retention is an indirect consequence - a model that provides a unifying common basis for the ubiquity of viviparity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cb","authors":["Kalinka, Alex T.","Alex T.
