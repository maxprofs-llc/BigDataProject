Pooled samples from 10 women who were subsequently diagnosed with GDM and from 10 healthy controls were used to construct two small RNA libraries. High-throughput sequencing was performed, and differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), followed by target prediction, Gene Ontology analysis, and pathway identification.\nSequencing revealed 32 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in GDM, including 12 miRNAs that were upregulated and 20 that were downregulated. Differential expression of five upregulated miRNAs (hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-19a-3p, hsa-miR-19b-3p, hsa-miR-20a-5p) was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Target prediction showed that the major targets of these miRNAs were associated with insulin resistance and abnormal pregnancies.\nThe five miRNAs that were differentially expressed in GDM could serve as noninvasive biomarkers. The results also provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie GDM, thereby contributing to the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b55","authors":["Zhu, Yanan","Tian, Fei","Li, Hailing","Zhou, Youxia","Lu, Jiafeng","Ge, Qinyu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijgo.2015.01.010","first_seen_on":"2015-04-22T20:46:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-3479","0020-7292"],"journal":"International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics","last_mentioned_on":1434554033,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25887942","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25887942?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ijgo.org\/article\/S0020-7292(15)00147-2\/abstract"],"pmid":"25887942","pubdate":"2015-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Profiling maternal plasma microRNA expression in early pregnancy to predict gestational diabetes mellitus","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/profiling-maternal-plasma-microrna-expression-early-pregnancy-predict-gestational-diabetes-mellitus-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5207216,"mean":6.1644978826512,"rank":2575008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2476228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5207216,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158393,"mean":9.830623175413,"rank":83709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":67980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158393,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1067,"mean":3.5779793621013,"rank":554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1067,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":3.9891304347826,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":5},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PforDHE\/status\/590979703999168512","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3932465],"posted_on":"2015-04-22T20:45:15+00:00","author":{"name":"DiabetesHealthEquity","url":"http:\/\/diabeteshealthequity.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/878302459072040961\/VnsyR7jF_normal.jpg","description":"Together we can achieve #health #equity! #CMEs available\ud83c\udf0e","id_on_source":"PforDHE","tweeter_id":"2331896749","geo":{"lt":33.749,"ln":-84.38798,"country":"US"},"followers":178},"tweet_id":"590979703999168512"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/status\/590027897877835776","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3932465],"posted_on":"2015-04-20T05:43:07+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
