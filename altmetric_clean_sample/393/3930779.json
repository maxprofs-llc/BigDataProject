Congressional action is required or federal funding for the program will end in September 2015. This supplement to Academic Pediatrics is intended to inform discussions about CHIP's future. Most of the new research presented comes from a large evaluation of CHIP mandated by Congress in the CHIPRA. Since CHIP started in 1997, millions of lower-income children have secured health insurance coverage and needed care, reducing the financial burdens and stress on their families. States made substantial progress in simplifying enrollment and retention. When implemented optimally, Express Lane Eligibility has the potential to help cover more of the millions of eligible children who remain uninsured. Children move frequently between Medicaid and CHIP, and many experienced a gap in coverage with this transition. CHIP enrollees had good access to care. For nearly every health care access, use, care, and cost measure examined, CHIP enrollees fared better than uninsured children. Access in CHIP was similar to private coverage for most measures, but financial burdens were substantially lower and access to weekend and nighttime care was not as good. The Affordable Care Act coverage options have the potential to reduce uninsured rates among children, but complex transition issues must first be resolved to ensure families have access to affordable coverage, leading many stakeholders to recommend funding for CHIP be continued.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056b1","authors":["Harrington, Mary E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.acap.2015.03.007","first_seen_on":"2015-04-22T11:04:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-2859","1876-2867"],"issue":"3 Suppl","journal":"Academic Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1429700634,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1876285915000789"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.academicpedsjnl.net\/article\/S1876285915000789\/pdf","pmid":"25906953","pubdate":"2015-04-25T22:02:58+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act Evaluation Findings on Children's Health Insurance Coverage in an Evolving Health Care Landscape","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/childrens-health-insurance-program-reauthorization-act-evaluation-findings-childrens-health-insuranc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5026115,"mean":5.9535157984903,"rank":2669120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1683190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5026115,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155351,"mean":9.7846870550372,"rank":90365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":48417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155351,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":307,"mean":5.5505032679739,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":307,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.3333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
