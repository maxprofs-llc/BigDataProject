Here, we report the case of a 30-year-old Japanese man with primary testicular lymphoma complicated, as seen in various neurological findings, by secondary NL prior to testicular swelling. Painless right scrotal enlargement was noticed more than 1 month after the appearance of neurological complications such as right upper extremity numbness, dysarthria, facial palsy, and diplopia. Proactive investigation and biopsies of extranodal sites at high risk of central nervous system infiltration of malignant lymphoma, such as the testes, should be considered when secondary NL is suspected based on imaging findings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006df9","authors":["Sunami, Y.","Gotoh, A.","Hamano, Y.","Yahata, Y.","Sakurai, H.","Shirane, S.","Edahiro, Y.","Komatsu, N."],"doi":"10.1159\/000381874","first_seen_on":"2015-04-23T12:51:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-6575"],"issue":"1","journal":"Case Reports in Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1429793484,"links":["http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/FullText\/381874"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/381874","pmid":"26034480","pubdate":"2015-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","title":"Various Neurological Symptoms by Neurolymphomatosis as the Initial Presentation of Primary Testicular Lymphoma","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/various-neurological-symptoms-neurolymphomatosis-initial-presentation-primary-testicular-lymphoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5030622,"mean":5.9580818173371,"rank":3558390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":824864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5030622,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156534,"mean":9.742967540391,"rank":115163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156534,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":5.2261098901099,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gottarun1000\/status\/591222842563420160","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3935144],"posted_on":"2015-04-23T12:51:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Scott Werntz","url":"http:\/\/www.miraclemiles.me","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3322174087\/7bcb548396c7d0d27f93007cd3900f58_normal.jpeg","description":"I am running 1000 miles in 1 year in honor of David Hatfield to raise $100,000 for Lymphoma and Leukemia Society.
