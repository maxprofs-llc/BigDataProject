A young boy finds a toy that he can hold with one hand and spin with another. In order to retrieve the toy and leave it in the clinic, the parents engage in a team effort. We describe this achievement in terms of two styles of practice or interactional routines with differing participation frameworks. We examine not only how the parents work as a team using these styles, but also how they improvise to extract the spinning toy from their son's grasp with minimal protest on his part.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb4","authors":["Maynard, Douglas W","McDonald, T A","Stickle, Trini"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10803-015-2568-5","endpage":"423","first_seen_on":"2016-08-04T19:15:36+00:00","issns":["1573-3432","0162-3257"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1470338121,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26494576"],"pmid":"26494576","pubdate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Child and School Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"406","subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Parents as a Team: Mother, Father, a Child with Autism Spectrum Disorder, and a Spinning Toy","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parents-team-mother-father-child-autism-spectrum-disorder-spinning-toy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":4327733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2267223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257712,"mean":11.992016258522,"rank":141474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257712,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2424,"mean":9.5472703260421,"rank":1928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2424,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":10.215649122807,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
