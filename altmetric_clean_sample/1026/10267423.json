However, the origin of OD is still in dispute. Moreover, characterizing the structure and location of supposed OD on nanosheets of GO produced during the oxidation process is difficult. Herein, the attached state and size of OD on graphene oxide nanosheets were directly observed using HRTEM, the molecular structure of OD was initially proposed based on the spectroscopic characterization and Q-TOF mass spectrometry, and the locations of OD on the GO nanosheets were detected through the adsorption of probe molecules onto as-prepared GO (a-GO) and base-washed GO (bw-GO). The results indicated that OD possesses a highly crystalline structure and can be defined as several nanometre-sized polyaromatic molecules with a considerable number of oxygen-containing functional groups attached on the edges. The dark nano-dot seated on a-GO was clearly observed in the HRTEM images, whereas it appeared as a clean nanosheet in the image of bw-GO, indicating that OD is removed by base-washing treatment. Following the base-washing treatment, the contents of carboxyl groups on bw-GO unexpectedly increased and subsequently contributed to the desorption of OD from a-GO due to the electrostatic repulsion being stronger than primary \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. Compared with a-GO, the adsorption of phenanthrene, as an aromatic probe, onto bw-GO increased by 6-fold via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions, whereas the increase in the adsorption of m-dinitrobenzene, as a defect probe, was not as remarkable as that of phenanthrene. Reasonably, the OD nanoparticles were primarily located at the sp2 structures on the GO nanosheets through \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions rather than attached on defects\/edges. The insights regarding the existence, molecular structures and attached sites of OD nanoparticles on GO nanosheets provide a theoretical basis for preparing OD-free GO for optimizing the potential applications of GO nanosheets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Xiaoxiao Chen"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.est.6b01020","first_seen_on":"2016-08-04T16:05:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5851","0013-936X"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1470329267,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.est.6b01020?hootPostID=623ba3f2c40900c3582d705cbddc16ba"],"pmid":"27447025","pubdate":"2016-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Direct Observation, Molecular Structure, and Location of Oxidation Debris on Graphene Oxide Nanosheets","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-observation-molecular-structure-location-oxidation-debris-graphene-oxide-nanosheets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":3730835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4354311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257711,"mean":11.992112459741,"rank":112632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":140481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257711,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9355,"mean":9.9651740431901,"rank":6680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9355,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262,"mean":26.22477394636,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
