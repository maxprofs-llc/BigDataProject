Thereby the protein partitioning can be selectively changed using a displacement agent (additional salt) in order to allow for a successful purification of the target protein. Within this work a new shortcut strategy for the calculation of protein partition coefficients in polymer-salt ATPS is presented. The required protein-solute (phase-forming component, displacement agent) interactions are covered by the cross virial coefficient B23 measured by composition gradient multi-angle light scattering (CG-MALS). Using this shortcut calculation allows for an efficient determination of the partition coefficients of the target protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the impurity human serum albumin (HSA) within PEG-citrate and PEG-phosphate ATPS independently on the protein concentration. We demonstrate that the selection of a suitable displacement agent allowing for a selective purification of IgG from HSA is accessible by B23. Based on the determination of the protein-protein interactions via CG-MALS covered by the second osmotic virial coefficient B22 a further optimization of ATPS preventing protein precipitation is enabled. The results show that our approach contributes to an efficient downstream processing development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd3","authors":["Kress, Christian","Sadowski, Gabriele","Brandenbusch, Christoph"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiotec.2016.06.032","endpage":"159","first_seen_on":"2016-08-04T17:33:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4863","01681656"],"journal":"Journal of Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1470393100,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168165616313888?sf31896775=1"],"pmid":"27388598","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"151","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Protein partition coefficients can be estimated efficiently by hybrid shortcut calculations","type":"article","volume":"233","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-partition-coefficients-estimated-efficiently-hybrid-shortcut-calculations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":4030515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4076891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257748,"mean":11.991850015713,"rank":127406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":127773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257748,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":999,"mean":3.20325250501,"rank":340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":999,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.4466666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ElsevierBiotech\/statuses\/761253643844784128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10268658],"posted_on":"2016-08-04T17:33:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Elsevier Biotech","url":"http:\/\/www.elsevier.com\/biotechnology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877085401881640960\/Qbu-ICrV_normal.jpg","description":"The latest news and research from the whole spectrum of red, white, green, blue, grey & black biotechnology","id_on_source":"ElsevierBiotech","tweeter_id":"346515319","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2426},"tweet_id":"761253643844784128"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/weight_emilie\/statuses\/761509975302742016","license":"gnip","rt":["ElsevierBiotech"],"citation_ids":[10268658],"posted_on":"2016-08-05T10:31:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Weight emilie","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/720296220019699712\/uXVcqrlk_normal.jpg","description":"Future is now and we are building it...
