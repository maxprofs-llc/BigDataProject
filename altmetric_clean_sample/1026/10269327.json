An O-mannose-type GalNAc-\u03b21,3-GlcNAc-\u03b21,4-(phosphate-6)-Man structure of \u03b1-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG), a subunit of the complex that is anchored to the cell membrane, interacts directly with laminin in the basement membrane. Reduced glycosylation of \u03b1-DG is linked to some types of inherited muscular dystrophy; consistent with this relationship, many disease-related mutations have been detected in genes involved in O-mannosyl glycan synthesis. Defects in protein O-linked mannose \u03b21,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGnT1), a glycosyltransferase that participates in the formation of GlcNAc-\u03b21,2-Man glycan, are causally related to muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), a congenital muscular dystrophy, although the role of POMGnT1 in postphosphoryl modification of GalNAc-\u03b21,3-GlcNAc-\u03b21,4-(phosphate-6)-Man glycan remains elusive. Our crystal structures of POMGnT1 agreed with our previous results showing that the catalytic domain recognizes substrate O-mannosylated proteins via hydrophobic interactions with little sequence specificity. Unexpectedly, we found that the stem domain recognizes the \u03b2-linked GlcNAc of O-mannosyl glycan, an enzymatic product of POMGnT1. This interaction may recruit POMGnT1 to a specific site of \u03b1-DG to promote GlcNAc-\u03b21,2-Man clustering and also may recruit other enzymes that interact with POMGnT1, e.g., fukutin, which is required for further modification of the GalNAc-\u03b21,3-GlcNAc-\u03b21,4-(phosphate-6)-Man glycan. On the basis of our findings, we propose a mechanism for the deficiency in postphosphoryl modification of the glycan observed in POMGnT1-KO mice and MEB patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Naoyuki Kuwabara","Hiroshi Manya","Takeyuki Yamada","Hiroaki Tateno","Motoi Kanagawa","Kazuhiro Kobayashi","Keiko Akasaka-Manya","Yuriko Hirose","Mamoru Mizuno","Mitsunori Ikeguchi","Tatsushi Toda","Jun Hirabayashi","Toshiya Senda","Tamao Endo","Ryuichi Kato","Kuwabara, Naoyuki","Manya, Hiroshi","Yamada, Takeyuki","Tateno, Hiroaki","Kanagawa, Motoi","Kobayashi, Kazuhiro","Akasaka-Manya, Keiko","Hirose, Yuriko","Mizuno, Mamoru","Ikeguchi, Mitsunori","Toda, Tatsushi","Hirabayashi, Jun","Senda, Toshiya","Endo, Tamao","Kato, Ryuichi"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1525545113","endpage":"9285","first_seen_on":"2016-08-04T18:29:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"33","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1472769028,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/03\/1525545113.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27493216?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27493216?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/113\/33\/9280.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/03\/1525545113.full.pdf","pmid":"27493216","pubdate":"2016-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"201525545","subjects":["science"],"title":"Carbohydrate-binding domain of the POMGnT1 stem region modulates O-mannosylation sites of \u03b1-dystroglycan","type":"article","volume":"113","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbohydratebinding-domain-pomgnt1-stem-region-modulates-ioi-mannosylation-sites-%CE%B1dystroglycan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":1898138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6400618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259484,"mean":11.995586338989,"rank":74441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":184280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259484,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46528,"mean":24.225071807768,"rank":21159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":25303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46528,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":921,"mean":63.281208695652,"rank":559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":921,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
