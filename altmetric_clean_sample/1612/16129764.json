Culturally appropriate health care is crucial during the perinatal period to ensure the health of immigrant mothers and their children. This project aims to explore and understand how the health beliefs and practices of Chinese immigrant women affect their food choices during the perinatal period.\nThis qualitative study used the methodology of focused ethnography. Women participated in one semi-structured interview, followed by a second photo-assisted, semi-structured interview which incorporated photographs taken by the women themselves.\nThe food choices and health behaviors of immigrant women were influenced by their general health beliefs, cultural knowledge concerning particular types of foods, traditional Chinese medical beliefs, social advice and information, and socio-economic factors.\nThe provision of culturally appropriate health care is crucial during the perinatal period, as it is not only a vulnerable life stage for women and their children but also a sensitive period of interaction with the Canadian health-care system. Understanding these intersecting factors can help to ensure culturally appropriate care and optimized health outcomes for Chinese immigrant women during the perinatal period.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001286","authors":["Gina Marie Awoko Higginbottom","Helen Valianatos","Janki Shankar","Jalal Safipour","Christina Davey"],"doi":"10.1080\/13557858.2017.1281384","first_seen_on":"2017-02-04T18:53:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1355-7858","1465-3419"],"journal":"Ethnicity &amp; Health","last_mentioned_on":1488396841,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/13557858.2017.1281384?ai=1mp&mi=79r7c4&af=R","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=28158953"],"pmid":"28158953","pubdate":"2017-02-06T22:08:33+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","socialsciences"],"title":"Immigrant women\u2019s food choices in pregnancy: perspectives from women of Chinese origin in Canada","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immigrant-womens-food-choices-pregnancy-perspectives-women-chinese-origin-canada"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.58,"score_history":{"1y":7.58,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":1148365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7136789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272450,"mean":12.594411203564,"rank":55238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":216666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272450,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308,"mean":3.8184560260586,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":5.7408333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Immigrant women\u2019s food choices in pregnancy: perspectives from women of Chinese origin in Canada","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/2017\/journal-article-abstracts\/immigrant-womens-food-choices-in-pregnancy-perspectives-from-women-of-chinese-origin-in-canada\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[16129764],"posted_on":"2017-02-04T12:23:00+00:00","summary":"&hellip;\nRead More:&nbsp;\nImmigrant women&rsquo;s food choices in pregnancy: perspectives from women of Chinese origin in Canada\nThe post Immigrant women&rsquo;s food choices in pregnancy: perspectives from women of Chinese origin in Canada was curated by","author":{"name":"information for practice","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/","description":"news, new scholarship &amp; more from around the world"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UANurseResearch\/statuses\/832333989058899971","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16129764],"posted_on":"2017-02-16T21:01:01+00:00","author":{"name":"UAlberta Nursing","url":"https:\/\/www.ualberta.ca\/nursing","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/839208552740737024\/RiT05mk3_normal.jpg","description":"University of Alberta, Faculty of Nursing","id_on_source":"UANurseResearch","tweeter_id":"2879976888","geo":{"lt":53.55014,"ln":-113.46871,"country":"CA"},"followers":813},"tweet_id":"832333989058899971"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UANurseResearch\/statuses\/837023136352714752","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16129764],"posted_on":"2017-03-01T19:34:01+00:00","author":{"name":"UAlberta Nursing","url":"https:\/\/www.ualberta.ca\/nursing","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/839208552740737024\/RiT05mk3_normal.jpg","description":"University of Alberta, Faculty of Nursing","id_on_source":"UANurseResearch","tweeter_id":"2879976888","geo":{"lt":53.55014,"ln":-113.46871,"country":"CA"},"followers":813},"tweet_id":"837023136352714752"}]}}
