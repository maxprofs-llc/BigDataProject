The extent of this problem to date is not clear. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to summarise the prevalence of OA and joint replacement of the lower limb and spine in former professional soccer players. Relevant databases were searched with different combinations of key words: e.g. osteoarthritis, hip, knee, ankle, foot, joint replacement, soccer. Studies were included if they were original research, included a sample of former professional male soccer players, had OA in the lower limb and\/or spine, OA was diagnosed either through questionnaires or x-rays, article in English, Dutch or German. Sixteen studies with 1576 former players and 2153 control subjects were included in the review. Studies agreed that the prevalence of hip OA and hip replacements is significantly higher in former players compared to the control group. For the ankle and spine there is only limited information and for the prevalence of knee OA and knee replacement the results are contradictory. The quality of the included studies was moderate. Future studies should have a prospective design to control for confounding factors, to identify possible risk factors and consequences for the individuals, and to be able to develop a prevention programme.
