The purpose of this study was to assess vascular enhancement in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma with or without liver metastasis in computed tomography (CT) and to analyze the correlation between enhancement patterns and chemo-responsiveness.\nPatients were assigned to either a responder group (partial response or stable disease) or a non-responder group (progressive disease) according to chemo-responsiveness assessed by CT before and after gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Hounsefield unit (HU) was measured in pancreatic mass and the largest metastatic liver mass using region of interest (ROI). HU differences (\u0394HU) between arterial and pre-contrast phase were calculated.\nOf the 101 study subjects, 78(77.2%) were assigned to the pancreas responder group {mean \u0394HU (\u00b1SD), 36.7(\u00b121.6)} and 23(22.8%) to the pancreas non-responder group {mean \u0394HU (\u00b1SD), 20.6(\u00b19.9)} (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 for \u0394HUs). Of the 46 study subjects with liver metastasis, 25(54.3%) were assigned to the liver metastasis responder group {mean \u0394HU (\u00b1SD), 36.9(\u00b121.0} and 21(45.7%) to the liver metastasis non-responder group {mean \u0394HU (\u00b1SD), 17.1 (\u00b124.0)}, (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005 for \u0394HUs).\nCT determined mass vascular enhancement patterns may predict chemoresponse in advanced pancreatic cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008448","authors":["Shin Il Kim","Jun Young Shin","Jin-Seok Park","Seok Jeong","Yong Sun Jeon","Moon Han Choi","Hyun Jong Choi","Jong Ho
