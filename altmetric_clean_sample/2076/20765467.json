Several dozen previously published proteomics studies have identified cell surface proteins for pathogens. In this issue, Celebioglu and Svensson (Proteomics 2017, XXX, XXX-XXX) use 2-D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to identify secreted and cell surface proteins of a commensual gut bacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM. Some of the proteins are known to have functions in the cytoplasm, and their presence on the cell surface suggests they might be moonlighting proteins. In addition, comparisons of proteins used by pathogenic and probiotic species to interact with their hosts could lead to improved treatments of infections and chronic diseases that are associated with an imbalance of pathogenic and probiotic gut bacteria.
