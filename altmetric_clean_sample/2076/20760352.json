It is essential that ultrasound reports contain and present all components necessary for a clinical decision in a reader-friendly format.\nOne hundred ninety thyroid and neck ultrasound reports were scored using the universal ultrasound report template developed by Su et al, along with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists\/Associazione Medici Endocrinologi\/European Thyroid Association (AACE\/AME\/ETA) guidelines. All ultrasounds were performed on patients seen between August and November 2015 by a single surgeon (M.L.U), and originated from a variety of physicians and institutions.\nAn average of 30.9% of Su et al's criteria was satisfactorily included in the reports. Similar results were reached when the ATA and the AACE\/AME\/ETA guidelines were applied as scoring templates.\nOur results reveal the wide variation in ultrasound reporting. The standardization of ultrasound reporting would help to improve physicians' ability to properly diagnose and manage patients with thyroid disease. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
