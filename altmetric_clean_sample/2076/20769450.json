A treatment is necessary due to chronicity and psychological changes that patient present.\nTo investigate epidemiological aspects and elaborate a risk group profile, promote early diagnosis and contribute to the knowledge about the disease.\nThis cross-sectional descriptive study with retrospective analysis of medical records of 194 patients diagnosed with hidrosadenitis in a dermatological reference center in the city of Bauru (SP) between 2005 and 2015.\nFemales accounted for 74% of cases. The age at diagnosis ranged from 10 to 67 years and the majority was within the 3rd and 4th decade of life. It occurred Association with diabetes mellitus in 33%, obesity in 55% and smoking in 61% was observed. Mean time between the onset of the disease and diagnosis was nine years. Hurley stage II was the most common at diagnosis. The therapeutic option mostly used in Hurley I and II was systemic antibiotics and in Hurley III was surgery.\nthe main limitation of this study is its retrospective design, which does not allow the true clinical confirmation of the disease by investigators.\nwe outlined the following profile: women, caucasian, between 3rd and 4th decade of life, associated with obesity, smoking, late diagnosis and multiple potential therapeutic modalities. We highlight the importance of studies like this in order to identify risk groups and encourage early diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e22a83eeb12a8b4a54","authors":["Andrade, Tatiana Cristina Pedro Cordeiro de","Vieira, Bruna Cortin\u00f3vis","Oliveira, Agnes Mayumi Nakano","Martins, T\u00e1bata Yamasaki","Santiago, Tatiane Meira","Martelli, Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Ceribelli"],"doi":"10.1590\/abd1806-4841.20175588","first_seen_on":"2017-06-02T05:38:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0365-0596"],"issue":"2","journal":"Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia","last_mentioned_on":1496381890,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28538878"],"pmid":"28538878","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"FapUNIFESP (SciELO)","startpage":"196","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Hidradenitis suppurativa: epidemiological study of cases diagnosed at a dermatological reference center in the city of Bauru, in the Brazilian southeast State of S\u00e3o Paulo, between 2005 and 2015","type":"article","volume":"92"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":4422990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2312767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241691,"mean":12.177466597708,"rank":133392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":85537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241691,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304,"mean":1.5797623762376,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AFRH\/statuses\/870514859892277248","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20769450],"posted_on":"2017-06-02T05:38:10+00:00","author":{"name":"AFRH","url":"http:\/\/www.afrh.fr","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3075869866\/b7cd8e9da0b7ddf2a623c24ec321397f_normal.png","description":"L' AFRH, Association Fran\u00e7aise pour la Recherche sur l'Hidrosad\u00e9nite est une association \u00e0 but non lucratif pour informer sur la Maladie de Verneuil","id_on_source":"AFRH","tweeter_id":"39957927","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":191},"tweet_id":"870514859892277248"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Hidradenitis suppurativa: epidemiological study of cases diagnosed at a dermatological reference center in the city of Bauru, in the Brazilian sout... - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10154816171067809&id=45925932808","license":"public","citation_ids":[20769450,20769450,20769450],"posted_on":"2017-06-02T05:38:02+00:00","summary":"Hidradenitis suppurativa: epidemiological study of cases diagnosed at a dermatological reference center in the city of Bauru, in the Brazilian southeast State of S\u00e3o Paulo, between 2005 and 2015.\nAndrade TCPC, Vieira BC, Oliveira AMN, Martins TY, Santiago","author":{"name":"AFRH","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/45925932808","facebook_wall_name":"AFRH","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/45925932808\/picture","id_on_source":"45925932808"}},{"title":"SciELO - Scientific Electronic Library Online","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1674731392836337&id=1464466237196188","license":"public","citation_ids":[20769450],"posted_on":"2017-06-01T17:07:33+00:00","summary":"O novo n\u00famero da revista \u00c1gora - Estudos em Teoria Psicanal\u00edtica (Volume 20, N\u00famero 2, Mai\/Ago, 2017) acabou de ser publicado e est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel na plataforma Scielo.\nAcesse http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_issuetoc&pid=1516-149820170002&lng=pt&nr","author":{"name":"Revista \u00c1gora - Estudos em Teoria Psicanal\u00edtica","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1464466237196188","facebook_wall_name":"Revista \u00c1gora - Estudos em Teoria Psicanal\u00edtica","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1464466237196188\/picture","id_on_source":"1464466237196188"}}]}}
