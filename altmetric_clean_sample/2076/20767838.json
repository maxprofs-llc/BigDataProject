In this study, we used a memory-guided saccade task to temporally dissociate the visual epoch from the saccadic epoch through a delay epoch, and used the local field potential (LFP) along with simultaneously recorded spike data to study the visuomotor transformation process. We showed that visual latency of the LFP preceded spiking activity in the visual epoch, whereas spiking activity preceded LFP activity in the saccade epoch. We also found a spatially tuned elevation in gamma band activity (30-70 Hz), but not in the corresponding spiking activity, only during the delay epoch, whose activity predicted saccade reaction times and the cells' saccade tuning. In contrast, beta band activity (13-30 Hz) showed a nonspatially selective suppression during the saccade epoch. Taken together, these results suggest that motor plans leading to saccades may be generated internally within the FEF from local activity represented by gamma activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Naveen Sendhilnathan","Debaleena Basu","Aditya Murthy"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1703809114","first_seen_on":"2017-06-02T03:04:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"24","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1503846936,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2017\/05\/31\/1703809114.abstract","http:\/\/m.pnas.org\/content\/pnas\/early\/2017\/05\/31\/1703809114.abstract.html?collection&utm_content=buffer914b2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/114\/24\/6370.abstract","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/114\/24\/6370.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2017\/05\/31\/1703809114.full.pdf","pmid":"28572407","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"201703809","subjects":["science"],"title":"Simultaneous analysis of the LFP and spiking activity reveals essential components of a visuomotor transformation in the frontal eye field","type":"article","volume":"114","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simultaneous-analysis-lfp-spiking-activity-reveals-essential-components-visuomotor-transformation-fr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3.25,"6m":3.25,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":2085530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6310297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247168,"mean":12.634304118268,"rank":79640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":166558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247168,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46870,"mean":24.571093558642,"rank":22142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":24412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46870,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":985,"mean":58.753676829268,"rank":664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":985,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
