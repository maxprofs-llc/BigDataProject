However, standard of care with regard to postoperative analgesia has not been described, and anecdotal evidence suggests wide variability with regard to postoperative narcotic and non-narcotic recommendations. We sought to quantify the postoperative course following suspension microlaryngoscopy by relating patient-based and intraoperative measures with analgesic use.\nBody mass index (BMI), Friedman tongue position (FTP), and Mallampati scores as well as laryngoscope type, number of attempts required for optimal visualization, and suspension time were documented in 50 consecutive patients undergoing routine suspension microlaryngoscopy. Postoperative symptoms and analgesic use was queried on postoperative days 1, 3, and 10.\nIn this cohort, 62.5% employed postoperative analgesia. However, only 20% required narcotics. No difference in suspension time was identified in those taking analgesics (33.0 vs 37.3 minutes, P = .44). In addition, no relationship between procedure type and the need for analgesia was noted. The majority of patients (76%) described sore throat persisting for 3 postoperative days; 36% reported sore throat persisting beyond postoperative day 3.\nThe majority of patients undergoing microlaryngoscopy reported discomfort, but symptoms were largely ameliorated with over-the-counter analgesics. Routine prescription of narcotics following routine suspension laryngoscopy may be unnecessary.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002282","authors":["Salvatore Taliercio","Brian Sanders","Stratos Achlatis","Yixin Fang","Ryan Branski","Milan Amin"],"doi":"10.1177\/0003489417693862","first_seen_on":"2017-04-12T16:53:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0003-4894","1943-572X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Annals of Otology, Rhinology & Laryngology","last_mentioned_on":1492596067,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28397564?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28397564?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28397564","pubdate":"2017-04-12T22:04:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Factors Associated With the Use of Postoperative Analgesics in Patients Undergoing Direct Microlaryngoscopy","type":"article","volume":"126","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-associated-postoperative-analgesics-patients-undergoing-direct-microlaryngoscopy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":6137591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1086379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238761,"mean":12.913696104875,"rank":169976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238761,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":683,"mean":3.3834985337243,"rank":520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":683,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.0227272727273,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/852202937619173376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18775377],"posted_on":"2017-04-12T16:53:08+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"852202937619173376"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/painmanwise\/statuses\/854635967252246528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18775377],"posted_on":"2017-04-19T10:01:07+00:00","author":{"name":"painmanwise","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514094062056390656\/ORtXawZi_normal.png","id_on_source":"painmanwise","tweeter_id":"2826634074","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":129},"tweet_id":"854635967252246528"}]}}
