(C. spinosa) has been used as food and traditional medicine and shows anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Here, we prepared the C. spinosa fruit ethanol extracts (CSEs) using different procedures and investigated the effects of CSE on the maturation of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). DC maturation and cytokine production were detected by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. We obtained three different CSEs and dissolved in water or DMSO, named CSE2W, CSEMW, CSE3W, CSE2D, CSEMD, and CSE3D, respectively. These CSEs showed different effects on DC maturation. CSEMW and CSEMD significantly increased the expressions of CD40, CD80, and CD86, in a dose-dependent manner. CSE2W and CSE2D also showed a modest effect on DC maturation, which enhanced the expression of CD40. CSE3W and CSE3D did not change DC maturation but suppressed LPS-induced DC maturation characterized by the decreased levels of CD40 and CD80. CSE3W and CSE3D also significantly inhibited the secretions of IL-12p40, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 induced by LPS. CSE3W further increased the level of IL-10 induced by LPS. Moreover, CSE3D suppressed LPS-induced DC maturation in vivo, which decreased the expressions of CD40 and CD80. These results suggested that CSE3W and CSE3D might be used to treat inflammatory diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Azeguli Hamuti","Jinyu Li","Fangfang Zhou","Adila Aipire","Ji Ma","Jianhua Yang","Jinyao Li"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules22010097","first_seen_on":"2017-01-07T07:48:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1495688829,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/1\/97?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/1\/97?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28067853?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/1\/97\/pdf","pmid":"28067853","pubdate":"2017-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"97","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Capparis spinosa Fruit Ethanol Extracts Exert Different Effects on the Maturation of Dendritic Cells","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/capparis-spinosa-fruit-ethanol-extracts-exert-different-effects-maturation-dendritic-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":3577107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4571464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269163,"mean":12.470762537059,"rank":113783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":150931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269163,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3873,"mean":2.1580666322314,"rank":666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3873,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":419,"mean":1.4873779904306,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":419,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
