The aim of the present study was to test the existence and scope of such a deficit in adult readers with dyslexia.\nWe tested 39 typical readers and 51 adult readers with dyslexia on their sensitivity to the simultaneity of audiovisual speech and nonspeech stimuli, their time window of audiovisual integration for speech (using incongruent \/aCa\/ syllables), and their audiovisual perception of phonetic categories.\nAdult readers with dyslexia showed less sensitivity to audiovisual simultaneity than typical readers for both speech and nonspeech events. We found no differences between readers with dyslexia and typical readers in the temporal window of integration for audiovisual speech or in the audiovisual perception of phonetic categories.\nThe results suggest an audiovisual temporal deficit in dyslexia that is not specific to speech-related events. But the differences found for audiovisual temporal sensitivity did not translate into a deficit in audiovisual speech perception. Hence, there seems to be a hiatus between simultaneity judgment and perception, suggesting a multisensory system that uses different mechanisms across tasks. Alternatively, it is possible that the audiovisual deficit in dyslexia is only observable when explicit judgments about audiovisual simultaneity are required.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f2f","authors":["Francisco, Ana A","Jesse, Alexandra","Groen, Margriet A","McQueen, James M","Ana A.
