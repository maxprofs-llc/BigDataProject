By contrast, neuroepithelial-like stem\/progenitor (NE) cells have been shown to be present throughout life in teleosts. We used 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of cleared transgenic wdr12:GFP medaka brains to demonstrate that this cell type is widespread in juvenile and to identify new regions containing NE cells. We established the gene expression profile of optic tectum (OT) NE cells by cell sorting followed by RNA-seq. Our results demonstrate that most OT NE cells are indeed active stem cells and that some of them exhibit long G2 phases. We identified several novel pathways (e.g., DNA repair pathways) potentially involved in NE cell homeostasis. In situ hybridization studies showed that all NE populations in the post-embryonic medaka brain have a similar molecular signature. Our findings highlight the importance of NE progenitors in medaka and improve our understanding of NE-cell biology. These cells are potentially useful not only for neural stem cell studies, but also for improving the characterization of neurodevelopmental diseases, such as microcephaly.
