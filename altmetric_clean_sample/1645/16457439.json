Selective readout of either synchronous or asynchronous activity allows formation of two streams of information processing. Theoretical work predicts that such a synchrony code is a fundamental feature of populations of spiking neurons if they operate in specific noise and stimulus regimes. Here we experimentally test the theoretical predictions by quantifying and comparing neuronal response properties in tuberous and ampullary electroreceptor afferents of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus These related systems show similar levels of synchronous activity, but only in the more irregularly firing tuberous afferents a synchrony code is established, whereas in the more regularly firing ampullary afferents it is not. The mere existence of synchronous activity is thus not sufficient for a synchrony code. Single-cell features such as the irregularity of spiking and the frequency dependence of the neuron's transfer function determine whether synchronous spikes possess a distinct meaning for the encoding of time-dependent signals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Jan Grewe","Alexandra Kruscha","Benjamin Lindner","Jan Benda"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1615561114","first_seen_on":"2017-02-16T05:19:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"10","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1488931464,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2017\/02\/14\/1615561114.short?rss=1&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Pnas-RssFeedOfEarlyEditionArticles+%28Early+Edition%29","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2017\/02\/14\/1615561114.abstract","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/114\/10\/E1977.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2017\/02\/14\/1615561114.full.pdf","pmid":"28202729","pubdate":"2017-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"201615561","subjects":["science"],"title":"Synchronous spikes are necessary but not sufficient for a synchrony code in populations of spiking neurons","type":"article","volume":"114","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synchronous-spikes-necessary-not-sufficient-synchrony-code-populations-spiking-neurons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":6020068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2007598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242589,"mean":13.674464334592,"rank":163805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":65050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242589,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46543,"mean":24.266124274849,"rank":41947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":3871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46543,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1062,"mean":51.856803016023,"rank":897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1062,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
