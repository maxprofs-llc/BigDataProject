Microscopic evaluation disclosed a spindle cell tumor that was well circumscribed by a perineurium. The tumor cells manifested wavy, bland nuclei displaying comma-shaped and pointed ends. These cells were uniformly S100 positive. Immunohistochemical analysis further revealed an even dispersion of numerous dot-like neurofilaments diagnostic of an isolated intraneural neuroma. A neuroma differs from a schwannoma which fails to exhibit neurofilaments except in a peripherally located compressed nerve of origin. Simple excision is recommended.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f6100083ca","authors":["Jakobiec, Frederick A.","Rashid, Alia","Yoon, Michael K."],"doi":"10.1097\/iop.0000000000000341","first_seen_on":"2017-02-16T06:05:47+00:00","issns":["0740-9303"],"issue":"6","journal":"Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1486921176,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/Fulltext\/2016\/11000\/Isolated_Nonsyndromic_Intraneural_Neuroma_of_the.33.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/2016\/11000\/Isolated_Nonsyndromic_Intraneural_Neuroma_of_the.33.pdf","pmid":"27828924","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e147","subjects":["generalsurgery","ophthalmology"],"title":"Isolated Nonsyndromic Intraneural Neuroma of the Eyelid Skin","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/Fulltext\/2016\/11000\/Isolated_Nonsyndromic_Intraneural_Neuroma_of_the.33.aspx","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolated-nonsyndromic-intraneural-neuroma-eyelid-skin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":7096932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237097,"mean":13.791091119209,"rank":198798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237097,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":638,"mean":1.119704866562,"rank":456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":638,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.35384615384615,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
