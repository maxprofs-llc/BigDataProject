Several methods can be applied for tailoring the properties of the printed pharmaceuticals. In this study, the use of electrospun fibrous substrates in the fabrication of inkjet-printed dosage forms was investigated. A single-drug formulation with lidocaine hydrochloride (LH) and a combination drug system containing LH and piroxicam (PRX) for oromucosal administration were prepared. The LH was deposited on the electrospun and cross-linked gelatin substrates by inkjet printing, whereas PRX was incorporated within the substrate fibers during electrospinning. The solid state analysis of the electrospun substrates showed that PRX was in an amorphous state within the fibers. Furthermore, the results indicated the entrapment and solidification of the dissolved LH within the fibrous gelatin matrix. The printed drug amount (2-3 mg) was in good correlation with the theoretical dose calculated based on the printing parameters. However, a noticeable degradation of the printed LH was detected after a few months. An immediate release (over 85% drug release after 8 min) of both drugs from the printed dosage forms was observed. In conclusion, the prepared electrospun gelatin scaffolds were shown to be suitable substrates for inkjet printing of oromucosal formulations. The combination of electrospinning and inkjet printing allowed the preparation of a dual drug system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c9","authors":["Mirja Palo","Karin Kogermann","Ivo Laidm\u00e4e","Andres Meos","Maren Preis","Jyrki Hein\u00e4m\u00e4ki","Niklas Sandler"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.molpharmaceut.6b01054","first_seen_on":"2017-02-16T03:04:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1543-8384","1543-8392"],"journal":"Molecular Pharmaceutics","last_mentioned_on":1487187118,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.molpharmaceut.6b01054"],"pmid":"28195483","pubdate":"2017-02-16T22:12:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Development of Oromucosal Dosage Forms by Combining Electrospinning and Inkjet Printing","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.molpharmaceut.6b01054","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-oromucosal-dosage-forms-combining-electrospinning-inkjet-printing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":4365959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2280624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237288,"mean":13.805573385815,"rank":138222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":76303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237288,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1187,"mean":4.998544688027,"rank":461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1187,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.0142857142857,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
