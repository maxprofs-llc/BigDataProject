This study proposes a conceptual model with direct and indirect relationships between childhood adversity and different targets of violence (partners and nonpartners), mediated by victimization experiences (by partner and nonpartners), mental illness, substance abuse, and anger. Using survey data from a random sample of incarcerated women (N = 574), structural equation modeling resulted in significant, albeit different, indirect paths from childhood adversity, through victimization, to perpetration of violence against partners (\u03b2 = .20) and nonpartners (\u03b2 = .19). The results indicate that prevention of women's violence requires attention to specific forms of victimization, anger expression, and targets of her aggression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f53cf058f610005ebc","authors":["Kubiak, Sheryl","Fedock, Gina","Kim, Woo Jong","Bybee, Deborah"],"doi":"10.1891\/0886-6708.vv-d-15-00177","first_seen_on":"2017-02-16T05:08:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0886-6708"],"issue":"1","journal":"Violence & Victims","last_mentioned_on":1487216451,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/springer\/vav\/2017\/00000032\/00000001\/art00002"],"pmid":"28234196","pubdate":"2017-02-26T22:02:55+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Criminology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychology"],"title":"Examining Perpetration of Physical Violence by Women: The Influence of Childhood Adversity, Victimization, Mental Illness, Substance Abuse, and Anger","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/10.1891\/0886-6708.VV-D-15-00177","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/examining-perpetration-physical-violence-women-influence-childhood-adversity-victimization-mental-il"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":7112857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237406,"mean":13.815678591436,"rank":199091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237406,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":451,"mean":3.8724755555556,"rank":414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":451,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.8452380952381,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CrimPapers\/statuses\/832072223125041153","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16456891],"posted_on":"2017-02-16T03:40:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Criminology Papers","url":"http:\/\/lesscrime.info\/journalalerts\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/598486878539612160\/TOOgQ4LJ_normal.jpg","description":"Automatic alerts of new papers in 86 criminology and associated journals, run by @lesscrime.
