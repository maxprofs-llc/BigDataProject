It has a negative effect on the quality of life of HIV patients and progression of the HIV disease. In the sub-Saharan African setting, including Ethiopia where both HIV infection and under-nutrition are expected to be high, there is a paucity of data on the matter. This study was aimed to reveal the magnitude and factors associated with anemia among adult HIV patients in Debre-Tabor Hospital, northwest Ethiopia.\nA hospital-based cross-sectional study was used among adult HIV patients in Debre-Tabor Hospital from April 1 to May 30, 2015. The diagnosis of anemia was made following the 2011 World Health Organization recommendation on hemoglobin cut-off points. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was carried out to assess factors associated with anemia.\nA total of 377 patients' charts were reviewed. Most of the participants (n=237, 62.9%) were taking antiretroviral treatment (ART). The overall prevalence of anemia was 23% (95% CI: 19.1, 27.6). Being ART-na\u00efve (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 3.37; 95% CI: 1.59, 7.14), having treatment history with anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug (AOR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.19, 8.67), taking zidovudine (ZDV)-containing ART regimen (AOR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.03, 4.57), and having recent CD4+ T-lymphocytes count of <200 cells\/\u03bcL (AOR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.04, 4.36) were associated with occurrence of anemia among adult HIV patients.\nAnemia continues to be a major co-morbidity among adult HIV patients in Ethiopia. Adult HIV patients who are taking ZDV-containing ART, with a history of TB treatment, have a low CD4+T-lymphocytes count and are ART-na\u00efve should be carefully screened and treated for anemia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc24","authors":["Hermela Melese","Molla Mesele Wassie","Haile Woldie","Abilo Tadesse","Nebiyu Mesfin"],"doi":"10.2147\/hiv.s121021","first_seen_on":"2017-02-16T03:08:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-1373"],"journal":"HIV\/AIDS (Auckland, N.Z.)","last_mentioned_on":1493789356,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/anemia-among-adult-hiv-patients-in-ethiopia-a-hospital-based-cross-sec-peer-reviewed-article-HIV","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/anemia-among-adult-hiv-patients-in-ethiopia-a-hospital-based-cross-sec-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-HIV"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=34899","pmid":"28243151","pubdate":"2017-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Anemia among adult HIV patients in Ethiopia: a hospital-based cross-sectional study","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/anemia-among-adult-hiv-patients-in-ethiopia-a-hospital-based-cross-sec-peer-reviewed-article-HIV","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anemia-among-adult-hiv-patients-ethiopia-hospitalbased-crosssectional-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.05,"score_history":{"1y":6.05,"6m":6.05,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":1322862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6823250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235981,"mean":13.784796940418,"rank":60344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":175401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235981,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":2.4260526315789,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.425,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ET":2,"US":2,"GB":1,"KE":1},"mendeley":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AlyssaHowardMD\/statuses\/831954466337390601","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16451957],"posted_on":"2017-02-15T19:52:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Alyssa Howard","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/718043013071507456\/vFosaofk_normal.jpg","description":"Graduated M.D. with a passion for making people better.
