Seventy-three patients from a single surgeon's practice who underwent arthroscopic repair of a single-tendon rotator cuff tear were randomized to either an early motion protocol (starting 2 to 3\u00a0days after surgery) or a delayed motion protocol (starting 28\u00a0days after surgery). The primary outcome measure was the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff index (WORC). Secondary outcome measures included clinical outcome scores, integrity of the repair on 6-month magnetic resonance imaging scans, pain scores, physical examination data, and ultrasonography. Study participants were followed up at 3, 6, and 12\u00a0weeks; 6\u00a0months; and 1\u00a0year postoperatively.\nThere was no statistically significant difference in WORC scores at 6\u00a0months (529 \u00b1 472 in delayed group vs 325 \u00b1 400 in early group, P\u00a0= .08). Mixed-effects analysis indicated the early group maintained lower WORC scores throughout the postoperative period (estimated difference of 191, P\u00a0= .04). The proportions of patients with tears on the 6-month postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan were comparable (31% in delayed group vs 34% in early group, P\u00a0= .78).\nThere was no difference between the delayed and early motion groups in WORC scores at 6\u00a0months after surgery. Early motion was associated with lower WORC scores throughout the postoperative period; however, both groups had a similar trajectory of improvement, suggesting both protocols have the same effect on patient-reported improvement. Although failure rates were similar between the groups, the sample size was not sufficient to\u00a0support a statement regarding the relation between tear morphology and the rehabilitation protocol.\nLevel II, lesser-quality randomized controlled trial.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b2c","authors":["Augustus D.
