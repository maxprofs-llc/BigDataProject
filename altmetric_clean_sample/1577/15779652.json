ROS act as a microbicidal defense mechanism, promoting clearance of infection, allowing for resolution of inflammation. Overproduction of ROS, however, overwhelms our cellular antioxidant defense system, promoting oxidation of protein machinery, leading to macrophage dysregulation and pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis. Here we will describe the role of the antioxidant tripeptide glutathione (GSH). Until recently, the binding of GSH, termed glutathionylation, was only considered to maintain the integrity of cellular components, limiting the damaging effects of an aberrant oxidative environment. GSH can, however, have positive and negative regulatory effects on protein function in macrophages. GSH regulates protein secretion, driving tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 release, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 stability, STAT3 phosphorylation, and caspase-1 activation in macrophages. GSH also plays a role in host defense against Listeria monocytogenes, modifying the key virulence protein PrfA in infected macrophages. We will also discuss glutathione transferase omega 1, a deglutathionylating enzyme recently shown to play a role in many aspects of macrophage activity, including metabolism, NF-\u03baB activation, and cell survival pathways. Glutathionylation is emerging as a key regulatory event in macrophage biology that might be susceptible to therapeutic targeting.","authors":["Hughes, Mark M","McGettrick, Anne F","O'Neill, Luke A J"],"doi":"10.1128\/microbiolspec.mchd-0044-2016","first_seen_on":"2017-01-25T14:27:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2165-0497"],"issue":"1","journal":"Microbiology spectrum","last_mentioned_on":1485184286,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28102119"],"pmid":"28102119","pubdate":"2017-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Glutathione and Glutathione Transferase Omega 1 as Key Posttranslational Regulators in Macrophages","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.asmscience.org\/content\/journal\/microbiolspec\/10.1128\/microbiolspec.MCHD-0044-2016","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glutathione-glutathione-transferase-omega-1-key-posttranslational-regulators-macrophages"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
