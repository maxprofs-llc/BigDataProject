It remains to be clarified whether numbness or pain reported by patients after mastectomy and RT are conditioned by changes in nerve transmission. The aim of this study was to examine the potential relationship between subjective sensory complications and neurophysiological examinations in breast cancer survivors with post-mastectomy pain syndrome.\nSixty breast cancer survivors (30 patients only after mastectomy - group A; and 30 after mastectomy with RT - group B) complaining of pain and sensory disturbances in the brachial plexus area and 20 healthy women (group C) were studied with regard to sensory perception and pain intensity using the Visual Analogue Scale and electroneurography (ENG).\nThere was a statistically significant decrease in the amplitudes in SCV recordings following stimulation of the ulnar (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and lateral cutaneous antebrachii nerves (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) in group B in comparison to group C. Additionally, a significant decrease in the amplitude and conduction velocity parameters was detected in the sensory fibers of the median and medial cutaneous antebrachii nerves in group A (p\u00a0=\u00a00.00 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.02, respectively) in comparison to group C.\nThe results of this pilot study suggest persistent post-mastectomy pain syndrome sometimes appears as a result of nerve injury in course of breast cancer surgery and RT. Therefore studies in nerve conduction may be added to the comprehensive patient assessment used in planning breast cancer patients' rehabilitation after oncological treatment has finished.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058cb","authors":["Katarzyna Hojan","Magdalena Wojtysiak","Juliusz Huber","Marta Moli\u0144ska-Glura","Agnieszka Wiertel-Krawczuk","Piotr Milecki"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejon.2016.03.007","endpage":"14","first_seen_on":"2016-07-27T23:09:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["14623889","1532-2122"],"journal":"European Journal of Oncology Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1469639905,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1462388916300254"],"pmid":"27456370","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"8","subjects":["nursing","neoplasms"],"title":"Clinical and neurophysiological evaluation of persistent sensory disturbances in breast cancer women after mastectomy with or without radiotherapy","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-neurophysiological-evaluation-persistent-sensory-disturbances-breast-cancer-women-after-mas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":7047504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257611,"mean":11.921657474477,"rank":217821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257611,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262,"mean":5.3396168582375,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
