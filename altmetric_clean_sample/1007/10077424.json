The trend in PbtO2 for the whole group was to increase with time (mean PbtO2 17.4 [1.75] vs 24.7 [1.60] mmHg, first- vs last-hour data, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.002). However, a significant increase in PbtO2 occurred in only 17 patients (68 %), all surviving to intensive care unit discharge (p\u2009=\u20090.006). Similarly, a consistent increase in PbtO2 with time occurred in only 13 patients, the correlation coefficient for PbtO2 versus time being \u22650.5 for all survivors. There were eight survivors and four non-survivors, with low correlation coefficients (<0.5). Significantly more patients with a correlation coefficient \u22650.5 for PbtO2 versus time survived in intensive care (p\u2009=\u20090.039). The cumulative length of time that PbtO2 was <20 mmHg was not significantly different among these three groups. In conclusion, although for the cohort as a whole PbtO2 increased over the first 24 h, the individual trends of PbtO2 were related to outcome. There was a significant association between improving PbtO2 and survival, despite these patients having cumulative durations of hypoxia similar to those of non-survivors.","aggregate_citation_ids":[7357656,7367610,7357654,7367975,7382107,7458547,7458543,7458538,7458537,7458536,7458532,7458531,7458530,7458550,7458535,7458534,7458546,7458545,7458544,7458541,7458542,7458540,7458539,7458549,7484961,7484957,7484955,7484963,7484960,10005003,10005021,10077425,10077426,10077427,10077428,10077429,10077432,10077433,10077434,10077435,10077436,10077437,10077438,10077439,10077440,10077441,10077443,10077444,10077445,10077447,10077448,10077449,10077450,10077452,10077453,10077454,10077455,10077457,10077458,10077459,10077461,10077462,10077463,10077451,10077431,10077456,10077460,7458548,10077446,7458533],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9243cf058f61000db54","attribution":"Google
