To address this challenge, in the last years the therapeutic algorithm of NSCLC has become much more complex and articulated, with different kinds of drugs, including chemotherapy, targeted-based agents, angiogenesis inhibitors and immunotherapy, and multiple lines of treatments, for patients with squamous and non-squamous hystology, EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement. This short viewpoint describes the emerging strategies for the management of NSCLC, indicating how a personalized approach, characterized by a specific multidisciplinary involvement, implies a process that starts with early detection and includes surgery and systemic therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b26","authors":["Rocco, Gaetano","Morabito, Alessandro","Leone, Alessandra","Muto, Paolo","Fiore, Francesco","Budillon, Alfredo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biocel.2016.07.011","endpage":"179","first_seen_on":"2016-07-27T15:51:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-5875","13572725"],"journal":"International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1474468086,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1357272516301832","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1357272516301832?via%3Dihub"],"pmid":"27425397","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"173","subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Management of non-small cell lung cancer in the era of personalized medicine","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer-era-personalized-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":4493806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2342626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260641,"mean":12.030462868324,"rank":141937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":93747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260641,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1141,"mean":3.7894894736842,"rank":629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1141,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":2.6545882352941,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PersonalMedsCon\/statuses\/758328948178554880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10071288],"posted_on":"2016-07-27T15:51:24+00:00","author":{"name":"PrecisionMedNews","url":"http:\/\/www.precision-medicine-conference.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/856527442931965952\/uR2F44UD_normal.jpg","description":"News and Information on Personalized and Precision Medicine, Companion Diagnostics, Genome Sequencing #pmcon #personalizedmedicine #precisionmedicine","id_on_source":"PersonalMedsCon","tweeter_id":"242516956","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1560},"tweet_id":"758328948178554880"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ELS_CellBiology\/statuses\/776697906611023872","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10071288],"posted_on":"2016-09-16T08:23:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Elsevier CellBiology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877086026761740288\/lcLNEyfR_normal.jpg","description":"Official page for the Elsevier Cell and Developmental Biology books & journals.
