Cochlear implants can restore some hearing, but rebuilding a lost hearing organ would be superior. Research has discovered many cellular and molecular steps to develop a hearing organ but translating those insights into hearing organ restoration remains unclear. For example, we cannot make various hair cell types and arrange them into their specific patterns surrounded by the right type of supporting cells in the right numbers. Our overview of the topologically highly organized and functionally diversified cellular mosaic of the mammalian hearing organ highlights what is known and unknown about its development. Following this analysis, we suggest critical steps to guide future attempts toward restoration of a functional organ of Corti. We argue that generating mutant mouse lines that mimic human pathology to fine-tune attempts toward long-term functional restoration are needed to go beyond the hope generated by restoring single hair cells in postnatal sensory epithelia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cb","authors":["Jahan, Israt","Pan, Ning","Elliott, Karen L.","Fritzsch, Bernd"],"doi":"10.1002\/bies.201500044","endpage":"1027","first_seen_on":"2015-07-24T13:09:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-1878"],"issue":"9","journal":"BioEssays","last_mentioned_on":1455628629,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.201500044\/abstract;jsessionid=1D385EF33E60352F2EAF2AC129E13A9D.f04t03","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26208302?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/bies.201500044","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26208302"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.201500044\/pdf","pmid":"26208302","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1016","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","biology"],"title":"The quest for restoring hearing: Understanding ear development more completely.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quest-restoring-hearing-understanding-ear-development-more-completely"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7200541,"mean":6.3358503237224,"rank":587865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6607319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7200541,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224868,"mean":8.1338234600899,"rank":26483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":198107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224868,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1322,"mean":6.1325011355034,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":1178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1322,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":11.571391304348,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
