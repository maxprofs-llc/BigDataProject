The present study examined the function of TRAP1 in cardiomyocyte hypoxia\/reoxygenation injury in vitro and myocardial I\/R injury in vivo.\nHL-1 cardiomyocytes transfected with TRAP1 or vector were subjected to simulated I\/R (SI\/R) in vitro. Cell death and mitochondrial function were assessed. Wild type (WT) and TRAP1 knockout (TRAP1 KO) mice were subjected to cardiac I\/R in vivo. The infarct size and myocardial apoptosis were determined. WT and TRAP1 KO cardiomyocytes were subjected to SI\/R in vitro. Mitochondrial function was assessed.\nTRAP1 overexpression protects HL-1 cardiomyocytes from SI\/R-induced cell death in vitro. The reduced cell death was associated with decreased ROS generation, better-preserved mitochondrial ETC complex activity, membrane potential, and ATP production, as well as delayed mPTP opening. Loss of TRAP1 aggravates SI\/R-induced mitochondrial damage in cardiomyocytes in vitro and myocardial I\/R injury and apoptosis in vivo.\nThe results of the present study show that TRAP1 provides cardioprotection against myocardial I\/R by ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction. \u00a9 2015 S.
