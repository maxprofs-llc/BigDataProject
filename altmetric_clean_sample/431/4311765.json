Maintaining excessive Te was essential for obtaining the stable stoichiometric 2H-MoTe2 phase. Further annealing under a lower partial pressure of Te at the same temperature, followed by a rapid quenching, led to the reverse phase transition from 2H-MoTe2 to 1T'-MoTe2. The orientation of the 2H-MoTe2 film was determined by the tellurization rate. Slow tellurization was the key for obtaining a highly-oriented 2H-MoTe2 film over the entire area, while fast tellurization led to a 2H-MoTe2 film with a randomly oriented c-axis. Our approach will pave the way for studying the phase transition of other transition metal dichalcogenides and also allow for the synthesis of a variety of large-area and high-quality multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides films.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Jin Cheol Park"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.5b02511","first_seen_on":"2015-07-24T06:03:39+00:00","issns":["1936-086X"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1435319409,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021%2Facsnano.5b02511"],"pmid":"26042796","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Phase-Engineered Synthesis of Centimeter-Scale 1T\u2032- and 2H-Molybdenum Ditelluride Thin Films","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phaseengineered-synthesis-centimeterscale-1t-2hmolybdenum-ditelluride-thin-films"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5279944,"mean":6.2124069797745,"rank":4396915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5279944,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186990,"mean":8.6688681687159,"rank":150410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186990,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4045,"mean":10.047759149357,"rank":3698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4045,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":10.196833333333,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
