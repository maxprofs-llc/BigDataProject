Interest is growing in minimally invasive treatment options, which should ideally be performed in an outpatient setting and have a short recovery time, durable efficacy and a good safety profile. The preservation of all aspects of sexual function, including antegrade ejaculation, seems to be increasingly important for patients. Initial experimental data on new minimally invasive procedures-such as the intraprostatic injection of novel agents including botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A), NX-1207 and PRX302-were promising, but clinical trials have not confirmed the findings. Trials of the mechanical prostatic urethral lift device-Urolift(\u00ae) (Neotract, Inc., USA)-have been positive, but further long-term results are needed to confirm its beneficial effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008260","authors":["Giuseppe Magistro","Giuseppe Magistro","Christian G.
