In 2012, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) began reporting details regarding unplanned reoperations within 30\u00a0days of initial procedure. The main objective of this study was to identify reoperation rates as a result of complications and evaluate complications by type of breast surgery.\nPatients who underwent surgery for breast cancer were identified from the 2012 ACS-NSQIP Participant User File. Breast procedures were categorized as mastectomy or lumpectomy, each with or without immediate breast reconstruction (IBR). All reoperations and complication-related reoperations were categorized on the basis of procedure and diagnosis codes, and rates were compared by breast procedure by Chi square tests.\nOf 18,500 patients, 781 (4\u00a0%) required an unplanned reoperation within 30\u00a0days (single reoperation in 747, 2+ reoperations in 34). Mean time to first reoperation was 13.4\u00a0days and varied by procedure. A majority (73\u00a0%) of ACS-NSQIP coded unplanned reoperations were due to complications. Rates of reoperation due to complication were highest in mastectomy with IBR (7\u00a0%). Most common complications requiring reoperation were bleeding, followed by infection and wound-related problems.\nUnplanned reoperations after breast cancer surgery are more frequent after mastectomy with IBR than other breast operations. Bleeding is the most common complication requiring reoperation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a31","authors":["Zahraa Al-Hilli","Kristine M. Thomsen","Elizabeth B. Habermann","James W.
