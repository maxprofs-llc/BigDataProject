Of 5022 women, 2.0% regretted having had a tubal sterilization at 1 year after the procedure and 2.7% did so after 2 years. Using a multivariate analysis to identify risk factors for regret, we found that almost all characteristics were more closely associated with regret at 1 year than at 2 years postoperatively. Of the characteristics we examined that could be objectively determined preoperatively, we considered only age less than 30 years and (for whites) a concurrent cesarean section to be risk factors for regret at 2 years after sterilization. However, in absolute terms, less than 10% of women with both those risk factors regretted having the procedure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c7","authors":["Grubb, G S","Peterson, H B","Layde, P M","Rubin, G L"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-23T18:25:45+00:00","issns":["0015-0282"],"issue":"2","journal":"Fertility & Sterility","last_mentioned_on":1437656400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/4018280"],"pmid":"4018280","pubdate":"1985-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Regret after decision to have a tubal sterilization.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regret-after-decision-tubal-sterilization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5393711,"mean":6.2953748280863,"rank":1039892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4329592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5393711,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189663,"mean":8.6567969862177,"rank":45373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":143831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189663,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3057,"mean":5.2217735602094,"rank":527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":2519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3057,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":4.3568869565217,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Regret After Tubal Ligation","url":"http:\/\/family-studies.org\/regret-after-tubal-ligation\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[4310172,829737,4310173,4310174,4310175,4310176],"posted_on":"2015-07-23T13:00:00+00:00","summary":"According to a 2008 study, &ldquo;Sterilization . . . is used by more people than any other method of contraception&rdquo; (Peterson, 2008).
