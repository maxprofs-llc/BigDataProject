Effective treatment for RSV infection is a significant unmet medical need. While new RSV therapeutics are now in development, there are very few animal models that mimic the pathogenesis of human RSV, making it difficult to evaluate new disease interventions. Experimental infection of Holstein calves with bovine RSV (bRSV) causes a severe respiratory infection that is similar to human RSV infection, providing a relevant model for testing novel therapeutic agents. In this model, viral load is readily detectable in nasal secretions by qRT-PCR and cumulative symptom scoring together with histopathology evaluations of infected tissue allow for the assessment of disease severity. The bovine RSV model was used to evaluate the antiviral activity of a RSV fusion inhibitor, GS1, which blocks virus entry by inhibiting the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. The efficacy of GS1, a close structural analog of GS-5806 that is being developed to treat RSV infection in humans was evaluated in two randomized, blinded, placebo controlled studies in bRSV-infected calves. Intravenous administration of GS1 at 4 mg\/kg\/day for 7 days starting at 24 h or 72 h post-inoculation provided clear therapeutic benefit by reducing the viral load, disease symptom scores, respiration rates and lung pathology associated with bRSV infection. These data support the use of the bovine RSV model for evaluation of experimental therapeutics for treatment of RSV.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Robert Jordan","Matt Shao","Richard L.
