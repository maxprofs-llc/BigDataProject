The authors used descriptive statistics to analyze the results.\nThe authors received 98 (75%) responses. Eighty-two schools (84%) offered course work in laboratory medicine; 76 (78%) required it. The median number of hours of required course work was 12.5, with 8.0 devoted to lectures and 4.5 to small-group, problem-based learning and\/or laboratory sessions. Only 8 schools required training in a clinical setting. Fewer than half reported regular, formal review of the laboratory medicine curriculum. The assessment of students' competency in laboratory medicine was rare (8 schools), and only half of respondents were aware of published curriculum guidelines. Barriers to teaching laboratory medicine included lack of sufficient time in the preclinical curriculum (86; 88%) or clinical curriculum (84; 86%), lack of knowledge of best laboratory practices by residents (70; 72%), lack of student interest (62; 63%), and lack of knowledge by attending physicians (58; 59%). Half of respondents were likely to use a national standardized examination to assess competency in laboratory medicine, if one was available.\nSignificant opportunities exist to improve laboratory medicine education, including in the proper use and interpretation of clinical laboratory testing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056af","authors":["Smith, Brian R","Kamoun, Malek","Hickner, John"],"doi":"10.1097\/acm.0000000000000817","first_seen_on":"2015-07-24T13:30:46+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1938-808X","1040-2446"],"issue":"1","journal":"Academic medicine","last_mentioned_on":1452018411,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/academicmedicine\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Laboratory_Medicine_Education_at_U_S__Medical.98730.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/academicmedicine\/Abstract\/2016\/01000\/Laboratory_Medicine_Education_at_U_S__Medical.33.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/academicmedicine\/9000\/00000\/Laboratory_Medicine_Education_at_U_S__Medical.98730.pdf","pmid":"26200574","pubdate":"2015-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["education"],"title":"Laboratory Medicine Education at U.S. Medical Schools: A 2014 Status Report","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laboratory-medicine-education-medical-schools-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":1426641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5469615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223609,"mean":8.0883206593683,"rank":56903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":166040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223609,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2874,"mean":8.6182882004873,"rank":1246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2874,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":9.7062105263158,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sparmetuic\/status\/624571763226185728","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4313261],"posted_on":"2015-07-24T13:28:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Sharon Parmet","url":"http:\/\/uicscience.tumblr.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3704685489\/f71754ed3cc824372b130966e6ae882c_normal.jpeg","description":"Assoc.
