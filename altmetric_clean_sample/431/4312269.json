All the patients underwent biopsy puncture, then the microwave ablation needle puncted in the center site of nodule with energy of 25-35 W, and the center tempera- ture could reach to 70-95 \u00b0C.\nMWA were successfully performed in all the patients without significant com- plications. Temporary hoarseness occurred in 5 cases and dispeared after 1-3 weeks, choking water occurred in 2 patients and recovered 3-5 days later. Ultrasound examination showed that the bloodstream of thyroid nodules disappeared in all the patients, and the nodules diminuted with varying degrees at 3-month and at 6-month follow- up Serum FT4 and TSH did not change significantly.\nUltrasound guided MWA could be effective in the treatment of recurrent thyroid nodule with minimal invasive technology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9213cf058f61000d8a4","authors":["Liu, Yuhui","Wang, Wenling","Wang, Yi","An, Lubiao","Shi, Guanjun","Feng, Bin"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-24T10:01:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1001-1781"],"issue":"7","journal":"Lin chuang er bi yan hou ke za zhi Journal of clinical otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1437732035,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26201188?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26201188","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"[Ultrasound guided percutaneous microwave ablation in the treatment of recurrent thyroid nodules].","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrasound-guided-percutaneous-microwave-ablation-treatment-recurrent-thyroid-nodules"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5395569,"mean":6.2971090647005,"rank":4489239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5395569,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189162,"mean":8.6767676423788,"rank":152001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189162,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230,"mean":0.58995633187773,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.48333333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/status\/624519537619173377","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4312269],"posted_on":"2015-07-24T10:00:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
