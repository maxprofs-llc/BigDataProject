In the US, Rotarix(\u00ae) (RV1) and RotaTeq(\u00ae) (RV5), have been associated with reductions in and severity of rotavirus disease. Studies have evaluated the impact of RV1 or RV5 but little is known about the impact of incomplete or mixed vaccination upon vaccine effectiveness.\nTest-negative case control study to examine association of combined RV1 and RV5 and rotavirus acute gastroenteritis, factoring severity of diarrheal disease. Children born after March 1, 2009 with acute gastroenteritis from three pediatric hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia were approached for enrollment. Survey was administered, stool specimen was collected, and vaccination records were obtained.\n891 of 1127 children with acute gastroenteritis were enrolled. Stool specimens were collected from 708 for rotavirus testing; 215 stool samples tested positively for rotavirus. Children >12 months of age were more likely to have rotavirus. Children categorized with Vesikari score of >11 were almost twice as likely to be rotavirus positive. Prior rotavirus vaccination decreased the mean Vesikari score, p<0.0001. Children with complete single type vaccination were protected against rotavirus (OR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.14-0.31, p<0.0001).\nComplete rotavirus vaccination with a single vaccine type resulted in protection against rotavirus diarrhea and decrease in severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Incomplete rotavirus vaccination either with a single vaccine or mixed vaccination types also provided some protection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["Anaam Mohammed","Lilly Immergluck","Trisha Chan Parker","Shabnam Jain","Traci Leong","Evan J.
