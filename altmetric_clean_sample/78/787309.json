The uses are well documented although renaming of species and the resulting confusing taxonomic nomenclature may cause uncertainty as to which specific species was referred to in some reports. The aim of this paper is to present a collated and coherent overview of the documented traditional uses of Helichrysum species and to update the botanical identity of previously studied species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f23cf058f610002d8d","authors":["Lourens AC","Viljoen AM","van Heerden FR"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jep.2008.06.011","first_seen_on":"2012-06-12T02:21:54+00:00","issns":["0378-8741"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1339467476,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18606217"],"pmid":"18606217","pubdate":"2008-07-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["socialsciences","pharmacology"],"title":"South African Helichrysum species: a review of the traditional uses, biological activity and phytochemistry.","type":"article","volume":"119","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/south-african-helichrysum-species-review-traditional-uses-biological-activity-phytochemistry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1989075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76309,"mean":4.9334052523981,"rank":28008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":45934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76309,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1896,"mean":2.7370638522427,"rank":750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1896,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":1.9646341463415,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
