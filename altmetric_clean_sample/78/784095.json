The function of the rapid sequence induction (RSI) is to minimize the time interval between the loss of the airway protection reflexes and tracheal intubation tube balloon. The objective of this study was to evaluate the rapid sequence induction among the anesthesiologists of the S\u00e3o Paulo Hospital.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56a768e32a83eeb12a8b4af1","authors":["Guirro UB","Martins CR","Munechika M"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0034-7094(12)70134-4","first_seen_on":"2012-06-09T05:59:12+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Revista Brasileira de Anestesiologia","last_mentioned_on":1339221544,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22656679?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"22656679","pubdate":"2012-06-06T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Assessment of anesthesiologists' rapid sequence induction technique in an university hospital.","type":"article","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-anesthesiologists-rapid-sequence-induction-technique-university-hospital"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":2897657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73406,"mean":4.5157115727811,"rank":53281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73406,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224,"mean":0.62269058295964,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.37222222222222,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":4,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2,"Medicine and Dentistry":14,"Social Sciences":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"IR":1,"ZA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rfdsdoc\/statuses\/211336592604934144","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[784095],"posted_on":"2012-06-09T05:59:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Minh Le Cong","url":"http:\/\/prehospitalmed.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/875116069672726528\/PyFn5cos_normal.jpg","description":"Prehospital and Retrieval, rural doctor,I work in the sky, love my family & dream of how to make things better .
