Four studies tested whether mental contrasting affects responses to goal-relevant negative feedback. Mental contrasting promoted the processing of negative feedback (Studies 1 and 2), which in turn helped participants to form plans beneficial for goal pursuit (Study 2). Mental contrasting also protected the self-view of competence against negative feedback (Study 3) and facilitated beneficial attributions for negative feedback (Study 4). All effects occurred in line with expectations of success. These results suggest that mental contrasting regulates effective responses to negative feedback by bringing goal pursuit in line with expectations of success.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6023cf058f610006396","authors":["Pak, Hyeonju","Andreas Kappes","Gabriele Oettingen","Hyeonju Pak"],"doi":"10.1177\/0146167212446833","endpage":"857","first_seen_on":"2012-06-12T17:13:42+00:00","issns":["1552-7433","0146-1672"],"issue":"7","journal":"Personality & Social Psychology Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1474725782,"links":["http:\/\/psp.sagepub.com\/content\/38\/7\/845.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/0146167212446833","http:\/\/psp.sagepub.com\/content\/38\/7\/845.abstract?etoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psp.sagepub.com\/content\/38\/7\/845.full.pdf","pmid":"22645162","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"845","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Mental Contrasting and the Self-Regulation of Responding to Negative Feedback","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mental-contrasting-selfregulation-responding-negative-feedback"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":1540776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6877561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96263,"mean":5.7451980428414,"rank":16468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":79687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96263,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1698,"mean":24.678847377725,"rank":920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1698,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":18.2,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
