The characterization and catalytic performance results revealed that the physico-chemical properties of the new hybrid catalyst comprised of chromium chloride and HY zeolite increased the levulinic acid production from glucose compared to the parent catalysts. Optimization of the glucose conversion process using two level full factorial designs (2(3)) with two center points reported 55.2% of levulinic acid yield at 145.2 \u00b0C, 146.7 min and 12.0% of reaction temperature, reaction time and catalyst loading, respectively. Subsequently, the potential of efb and kenaf for producing levulinic acid at the optimum conditions was established after 53.2% and 66.1% of efficiencies were reported. The observation suggests that the hybrid catalyst has a potential to be used in biomass conversion to levulinic acid.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Nazlina Ya\u2019aini","Nor Aishah Saidina Amin","Mohd Asmadi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2012.03.097","endpage":"65","first_seen_on":"2012-06-13T06:00:52+00:00","issns":["09608524"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1339567242,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0960852412005615"],"pmid":"22609656","pubdate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"58","title":"Optimization of levulinic acid from lignocellulosic biomass using a new hybrid catalyst","type":"article","volume":"116","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimization-levulinic-acid-lignocellulosic-biomass-using-new-hybrid-catalyst-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635501,"mean":4.9219382456039,"rank":2018580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635501,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73583,"mean":4.5411854801445,"rank":33588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":27255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73583,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":742,"mean":1.8365236167341,"rank":259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":742,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.2173043478261,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
