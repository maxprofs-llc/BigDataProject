TNF antagonists seem to increase risk. Points to infectious cause."],"citation":{"abstract":"Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) antagonists have advanced the treatment of inflammatory arthropathies, and are even considered for use in refractory sarcoidosis with some success. Paradoxically, cases of new onset sarcoidosis-like diseases are increasingly reported in patients receiving TNF-a antagonists. Here, we report three cases of sarcoid-like granulomatosis that developed during treatment with TNF-a antagonists. Review of the Biologics clinic data base at Westmead, Sydney, Australia identified three patients whom, during anti-TNF therapy, developed non-caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis. These three cases are described with review of the literature from 2000 to 2009 using PubMed. One hundred and sixty-nine patients within our data base were reviewed for the period 2003\u20132009. Sarcoidosis-like granulomas developed in three patients within a period of 3 to 36 months of treatment with etanercept and\/or adalimumab. All cases demonstrated non-infective, non-caseating granulomas on renal or lymph node biopsy. Improvement was seen in two cases upon cessation of TNF-a antagonist and steroid therapy. Interestingly, clinical deterioration was noted upon re-challenge with the same TNF-a antagonist in one patient. To date, a total of 37 cases of sarcoid-like granuloma development after anti-TNF therapy have been reported in the literature. Development of sarcoidosis-like granulomatosis in patients treated with TNF-a antagonists is a phenomenon previously under-recognised. All three anti-TNF agents have been observed to cause this phenomenon, suggesting a \u2018class effect\u2019 rather than being drug specific.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002afe","authors":["Tong D","Manolios N","Howe G","Spencer D"],"first_seen_on":"2012-06-08T02:28:25+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Internal Medicine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1387018511,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22389903?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22389903"],"pmid":"22389903","pubdate":"2012-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"New onset sarcoid-like granulomatosis developing during anti-TNF therapy: an under-recognised complication.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-onset-sarcoidlike-granulomatosis-developing-during-antitnf-therapy-underrecognised-complication"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":984287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3513997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76359,"mean":4.8949405432305,"rank":16544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":59623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76359,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":498,"mean":3.0037987927565,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":498,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.1292857142857,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
