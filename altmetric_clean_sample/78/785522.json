These negative data far outweigh a few documented benefits for a limited set of medical indications, for which safe and effective alternative treatments are readily available. If there is any medical role for cannabinoid drugs, it lies with chemically defined compounds, not with unprocessed cannabis plant. Legalization or medical use of smoked cannabis is likely to impose significant public health risks, including an increased risk of schizophrenia, psychosis, and other forms of substance use disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9183cf058f61000d225","authors":["Svrakic DM","Lustman PJ","Mallya A","Lynn TA","Finney R","Svrakic NM"],"first_seen_on":"2012-06-10T21:26:19+00:00","issns":["0026-6620"],"issue":"2","journal":"Missouri medicine","last_mentioned_on":1474465610,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22675784?dopt=Citation","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22675784"],"pmid":"22675784","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Legalization, decriminalization & medicinal use of cannabis: a scientific and public health perspective.","type":"article","volume":"109","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/legalization-decriminalization-medicinal-cannabis-scientific-public-health-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":1233967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7104511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96301,"mean":5.727987497404,"rank":13789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":81843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96301,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":3.5377368421053,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":2.6,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
