A comparison was made between women's bra size as measured by the traditional bra fitting method with their recommended bra size based on professional bra fitting criteria. Forty-five female participants were recruited; their mode self-reported bra size was 34DD. Participants were measured in their own bra using the traditional bra-fitting method to establish their 'traditional size'. A 'best-fit' bra size was recorded for participants based on professional bra fitting criteria. Significant differences were found between traditional and best-fit cup and band sizes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); the traditional method of bra fitting overestimated band size and underestimated cup size. As band size increased the traditional method also became more inaccurate (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). It is recommended that women are educated in assessing their own bra fit using professional bra fitting criteria and less emphasis placed on determining absolute bra size. Practitioner Summary: This is the first study to investigate using professional bra fitting criteria to establish best-fit in an underwired bra commonly sold in the UK. The traditional method of bra fitting was found to be inadequate, especially for larger-breasted women; the use of professional bra fitting criteria should be encouraged.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001232","authors":["White J","Scurr J"," J.
