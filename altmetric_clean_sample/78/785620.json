Over the past two decades, it is now recognized that vitamin D not only is important for calcium metabolism and maintenance of bone health throughout life, but also plays an important role in reducing risk of many chronic diseases including type I diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, deadly cancers, heart disease and infectious diseases. How vitamin D is able to play such an important role in health is based on observation that all tissues and cells in the body have a vitamin D receptor, and, thus, respond to its active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. However, this did not explain how living at higher latitudes and being at risk of vitamin D deficiency increased risk of these deadly diseases since it was also known that the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels are normal or even elevated when a person is vitamin D insufficient. Moreover, increased intake of vitamin D or exposure to more sunlight will not induce the kidneys to produce more 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The revelation that the colon, breast, prostate, macrophages and skin among other organs have the enzymatic machinery to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D provides further insight as to how vitamin D plays such an essential role for overall health and well being. This review will put into perspective many of the new biologic actions of vitamin D and on how 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is able to regulate directly or indirectly more than 200 different genes that are responsible for a wide variety of biologic processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003110","authors":["Holick MF"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mam.2008.08.008","endpage":"368","first_seen_on":"2012-06-10T22:57:28+00:00","issns":["0098-2997","00982997"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecular Aspects of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1483434159,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18801384","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2629072\/pdf\/nihms82607.pdf","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0098299708000587"],"pmcid":"PMC2629072","pmid":"18801384","pubdate":"2008-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"361","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The Vitamin D Deficiency Pandemic and Consequences for Nonskeletal Health: Mechanisms of Action","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-deficiency-pandemic-consequences-nonskeletal-health-mechanisms-action"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":3395625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4466757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95147,"mean":5.4725538645871,"rank":34112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":59242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95147,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248,"mean":4.5662672064777,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.2666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
