PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"Scaffolding proteins such as SSeCKS\/Gravin\/AKAP12 (\"AKAP12\") are thought to control oncogenic signaling pathways by regulating key mediators in a spatiotemporal manner. The downregulation of AKAP12 in many human cancers, often associated with promoter hypermethylation, or the loss of its locus at 6q24-25.2, correlates with progression to malignancy and metastasis. The forced re-expression of AKAP12 in cancer cell lines suppresses in vitro parameters of oncogenic growth, invasiveness, and cell motility through its ability to scaffold protein kinase C (PKC), F-actin, cyclins, Src, and phosphoinositides, and possibly through additional scaffolding domains for PKA, calmodulin, \u03b21,4-galactosyltransferase-polypeptide-1, \u03b22-adrenergic receptors, and cAMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4D. Moreover, AKAP12 re-expression in tumor models results in metastasis suppression through the inhibition of Src-regulated, VEGF-mediated neovascularization at distal sites. The current review will describe the emerging understanding of how AKAP12 regulates cellular senescence and oncogenic progression at the level of tumor cells and tumor-associated microenvironment via its multiple scaffolding functions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000dfa","authors":["Gelman IH"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10555-012-9360-1","endpage":"500","first_seen_on":"2012-06-12T10:57:20+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1573-7233","0167-7659"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"Cancer and Metastasis Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1339498248,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22684366?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22684366","pubdate":"2012-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"493","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Suppression of tumor and metastasis progression through the scaffolding functions of SSeCKS\/Gravin\/AKAP12.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suppression-tumor-metastasis-progression-through-scaffolding-functions-ssecksgravinakap12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4836654,"mean":5.7720053181421,"rank":4048087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4836654,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77558,"mean":5.1488183400596,"rank":64450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77558,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":2.5697446808511,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.6392857142857,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
