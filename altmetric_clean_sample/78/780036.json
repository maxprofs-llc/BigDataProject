Although DD was shown to deplete some Tregs in primates, its effects on NK cells (CD16(+)CD8(+)NKG2A(+)CD3(-)), which constitutively express the intermediate-affinity IL-2R (\u03b2-\u03b3 dimers) and play a critical role in antitumor immunity, are still unknown. To address this question, cynomolgus monkeys were injected i.v. with two doses of DD (8 or 18 \u03bcg\/kg). This treatment resulted in a rapid, but short-term, reduction in detectable peripheral blood resting Tregs (CD4(+)CD45RA(+)Foxp3(+)) and a transient increase in the number of activated Tregs (CD4(+)CD45RA(-)Foxp3(high)), followed by their partial depletion (50-60%). In contrast, all NK cells were deleted immediately and durably after DD administration. This difference was not due to a higher binding or internalization of DD by NK cells compared with Tregs. Coadministration of DD with IL-15, which binds to IL-2R\u03b2-\u03b3, abrogated DD-induced NK cell deletion in vitro and in vivo, whereas it did not affect Treg elimination. Taken together, these results show that DD exerts a potent cytotoxic effect on NK cells, a phenomenon that might impair its antitumoral properties. However, coadministration of IL-15 with DD could alleviate this problem by selectively protecting potentially oncolytic NK cells, while allowing the depletion of immunosuppressive Tregs in cancer patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Kawai, Tatsuo"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1200656","first_seen_on":"2012-06-06T21:08:26+00:00","funders":["niaid","phs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1550-6606"],"journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1339017826,"links":["http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/188\/12\/6063.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/188\/12\/6063.full.pdf","pmid":"22586034","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Differential Effects of Denileukin Diftitox IL-2 Immunotoxin on NK and Regulatory T Cells in Nonhuman Primates","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-effects-denileukin-diftitox-il2-immunotoxin-nk-regulatory-t-cells-nonhuman-primates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992147,"mean":6.7405564850737,"rank":6914285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992147,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94925,"mean":5.4437953731406,"rank":78077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94925,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6871,"mean":2.8192154294032,"rank":5967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6871,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":1.4068048780488,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
