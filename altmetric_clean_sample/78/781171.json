The literature was reviewed to: (1) provide an overview of the characteristics and prevalence of motor problems and (2) evaluate the effects of growth hormone (GH) treatment and physical training on motor performance. A systematic search revealed 34 papers: 13 on motor performance; 12 on GH treatment; and nine on physical training. In infants, motor development is 30-57% of the normal reference values, and children and adults also have significant problems in skill acquisition, muscle force, cardiovascular fitness, and activity level. GH treatment positively influenced motor performance in infants, children, and adults, although not all studies demonstrated an effect. All studies on physical training demonstrated beneficial effects in PWS patients. We suggest a combination of GH treatment and physical training to be started as soon as possible, especially in infants, to improve motor development as this will positively influence general development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ab","authors":["Reus L","van Vlimmeren LA","Staal JB","Otten BJ","Sanden MW"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neubiorev.2012.05.005","first_seen_on":"2012-06-07T12:54:03+00:00","issns":["0149-7634","01497634"],"issue":"","journal":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1351503954,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22652271.1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0149763412000772"],"pmid":"22652271","pubdate":"2012-06-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","neurology"],"title":"The effect of growth hormone treatment or physical training on motor performance in Prader\u2013Willi syndrome: A systematic review ","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-growth-hormone-treatment-physical-training-motor-performance-praderwilli-syndrome-systematic-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":769934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2838103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73341,"mean":4.5110066539405,"rank":14345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":58576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73341,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":815,"mean":6.2114029484029,"rank":282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":815,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":4.1842105263158,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
