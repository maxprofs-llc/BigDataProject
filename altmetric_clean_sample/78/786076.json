A more fruitful approach is to understand the contexts and circumstances associated with effectiveness. This article aims: to firstly understand factors influencing professionals' practice following their participation in training that aimed to reduce children's exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) in the home via increased usage of brief interventions; and secondly to consider the implications of these factors for improving the skills of a diverse workforce.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c22","authors":["McGranachan, Margaret","Jacki Gordon","Brenda Friel","Margaret McGranachan"],"doi":"10.1177\/1757913912442271","endpage":"143","first_seen_on":"2012-06-11T10:23:47+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1757-9147","1757-9139"],"issue":"3","journal":"Perspectives in Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1339497482,"links":["http:\/\/rsh.sagepub.com\/content\/132\/3\/135.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rsh.sagepub.com\/content\/132\/3\/135.full.pdf","pmid":"22700578","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"135","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Professional training to reduce children\u2019s exposure to second-hand smoke in the home: evidence-based considerations on targeting and content","type":"article","volume":"132","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/professional-training-reduce-childrens-exposure-secondhand-smoke-home-evidencebased-considerations-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":3353225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1480960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78732,"mean":5.1957904510295,"rank":47385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":27716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78732,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221,"mean":3.5507454545455,"rank":168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":13.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
