To investigate whether procalcitonin (PCT) could be useful for detecting bacterial infections in patients on hemodialysis (HD) and with increased calcitonin (CT). Methods. This prospective study included 42 males and 34 females on HD. The infection group consisted of 15 patients with proven bacterial infections; the other 61 patients were designated as the noninfection group. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, white blood cell (WBC) count, immature and total neutrophil (I\/T) ratio, and CT were measured at the beginning of HD, and serum PCT levels at the beginning of HD and after HD. Results. The mean CT level in the both groups was apparently higher than that of nonchronic kidney disease. Significantly higher values between the infection and noninfection groups were seen for CRP, IL-6, WBC, I\/T ratio, PCT, and CT. The PCT value of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.921, which was significantly higher than the values for CRP (0.853; P < 0.01), IL-6 (0.739; P < 0.01), WBC (0.692; P < 0.01), and I\/T ratio (0.584; P < 0.01). Conclusions. PCT was useful marker of bacterial infection in patients on HD and with increased CT. PCT levels should be determined before HD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007ab1","doi":"10.5402\/2012\/431859","first_seen_on":"2012-06-12T11:42:00+00:00","issns":["2090-5815"],"journal":"ISRN Urology","last_mentioned_on":1340205505,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22685675"],"pmid":"22685675","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Use of procalcitonin in patients on chronic hemodialysis: procalcitonin is not related with increased serum calcitonin.","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/procalcitonin-patients-chronic-hemodialysis-procalcitonin-not-related-increased-serum-calcitonin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3063581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76309,"mean":4.9445417780573,"rank":48645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":14705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76309,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.96875,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":13.5,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1},"mendeley":{"EG":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Procalcitonine\/status\/212508936396480512","citation_ids":[787990],"posted_on":"2012-06-12T11:37:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Thermo Scientific FR","url":"http:\/\/www.thermoscientific.com\/brahms","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1689497883\/PCT4SepsisFNL_normal.jpg","description":"Actualit\u00e9s de la Procalcitonine\/PCT en France. \r\nCE marked but specific product claims may differ from country to country based on regulations and approvals.","id_on_source":"Procalcitonine","tweeter_id":"372760748","geo":{"lt":46,"ln":2,"country":"FR"},"followers":250},"tweet_id":"212508936396480512"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Procalcitonine\/status\/215463621646491648","citation_ids":[787990],"posted_on":"2012-06-20T15:18:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Thermo Scientific FR","url":"http:\/\/www.thermoscientific.com\/brahms","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1689497883\/PCT4SepsisFNL_normal.jpg","description":"Actualit\u00e9s de la Procalcitonine\/PCT en France. \r\nCE marked but specific product claims may differ from country to country based on regulations and approvals.","id_on_source":"Procalcitonine","tweeter_id":"372760748","geo":{"lt":46,"ln":2,"country":"FR"},"followers":250},"tweet_id":"215463621646491648"}]}}
