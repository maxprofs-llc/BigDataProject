The circannual serotonergic functioning is hypothesized to be central in this phenomenon. Antidepressant medications exert their pharmacological action mainly by regulating serotonin. Our aim is to study the amplitude of the seasonal effect among suicide victims positive for different classes of antidepressants or without any antidepressants at the time of death.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002163","authors":["Makris, G.
