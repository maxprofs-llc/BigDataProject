Numerous mutations in the 23 exons of the NOTCH3 gene have been reported to cause CADASIL in Caucasian populations, but the full spectrum of genetic changes leading to this disease is yet to be known and, especially, very few reports are available on CADASIL in Asian populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E6590T","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Zhen-Xuan Tan","Fei-Feng Li","You-Yang Qu","Ji Liu","Gui-Rong Liu","Jin Zhou","Yu-Lan Zhu","Shu-Lin Liu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0036590","first_seen_on":"2012-06-11T14:24:33+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1339098542,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036590"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0036590.pdf","pmid":"22623959","pubdate":"2012-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e36590","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Identification of a Known Mutation in Notch 3 in Familiar CADASIL in China","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-known-mutation-notch-3-familiar-cadasil-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":2906738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73378,"mean":4.5933874647369,"rank":53812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73378,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64064,"mean":8.3129273683718,"rank":50350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64064,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3107,"mean":6.2008931101095,"rank":2423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3107,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
