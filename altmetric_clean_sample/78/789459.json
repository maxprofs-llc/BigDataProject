The implementation of the acquisition scheme has required the development of an electronic interface between the undulator and the beamline. The characterization of delays and jitters in the synchronous movement of various motor axes has motivated the development of a new electronic synchronization scheme among various axes, including the case when one of the axes is electronically accessible in `read-only' mode. A software prototype has been developed to allow the existing hard continuous software to work in user units. The complete strategy has been implemented and successfully tested at the TEMPO beamline.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f4b","authors":["Chauvet, C."],"doi":"10.1107\/s090904951201374x","first_seen_on":"2012-06-13T02:50:42+00:00","issns":["0909-0495"],"journal":"Journal of Synchrotron Radiation (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1339632005,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper_yard?kv5098&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/s\/issues\/2012\/04\/00\/kv5098\/kv5098.pdf","pmid":"22713899","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
