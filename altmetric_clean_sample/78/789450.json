The development of advanced, higher-energy lithium batteries is essential in the rapid establishment of the electric car market. Owing to its exceptionally high energy potentiality, the lithium-air battery is a very appealing candidate for fulfilling this role. However, the performance of such batteries has been limited to only a few charge-discharge cycles with low rate capability. Here, by choosing a suitable stable electrolyte and appropriate cell design, we demonstrate a lithium-air battery capable of operating over many cycles with capacity and rate values as high as 5,000 mAh g(carbon)(-1) and 3 A g(carbon)(-1), respectively. For this battery we estimate an energy density value that is much higher than those offered by the currently available lithium-ion battery technology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012NatCh...4..579J","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004265","authors":["Hun-Gi Jung","Jusef Hassoun","Jin-Bum Park","Yang-Kook Sun","Bruno Scrosati"],"doi":"10.1038\/nchem.1376","first_seen_on":"2012-06-13T02:28:59+00:00","issns":["1755-4330","1755-4349"],"journal":"Nature Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1356714520,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/NCHEM.1376"],"pmid":"22717445","pubdate":"2012-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"An improved high-performance lithium\u2013air battery","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improved-highperformance-lithiumair-battery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":24.878,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":24.878},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8005522,"mean":6.7563037233882,"rank":327350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7678504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8005522,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95444,"mean":5.5244277317352,"rank":3387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":92057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95444,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1673,"mean":25.145197368421,"rank":501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":1172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1673,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":10.745707317073,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Researcher":90,"Student  > Doctoral Student":21,"Student  > Ph.
