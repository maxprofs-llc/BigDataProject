C57\/BL6-HGF\/SF transgenic mice were exposed to UV radiation as pups and began to develop visible melanomas 5-6 months later. We have treated 27 of these melanomas in 14 mice with nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF) therapy delivering 2000 electric pulses each 100 ns long and 30 kV\/cm at a rate of 5-7 pulses per second. All nanoelectroablated melanoma tumors began to shrink within a day after treatment and gradually disappeared over a period of 12-29 days. Pyknosis of nuclei was evident within 1 h of nsPEF treatment, and DNA fragmentation as detected by TUNEL staining was evident by 6 h after nsPEF treatment. In a melanoma allograft system, nsPEF treatment was superior to tumor excision at accelerating secondary tumor rejection in immune-competent mice, suggesting enhanced stimulation of a protective immune response by nsPEF-treated melanomas. This is supported by the presence of CD4(+) -T cells within treated tumors as well as within untreated tumors located in mice with other melanomas that had been treated with nanoelectroablation at least 19 days earlier.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000332b","authors":["Nuccitelli R","Tran K","Lui K","Huynh J","Athos B","Kreis M","Nuccitelli P","De Fabo EC","Nuccitelli, Richard","Tran, Kevin","Lui, Kaying","Huynh, Joanne","Athos, Brian","Kreis, Mark","Nuccitelli, Pamela","De Fabo, Edward C."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1755-148x.2012.01027.x","endpage":"629","first_seen_on":"2012-06-11T18:44:27+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1755-148X","1755-1471"],"issue":"5","journal":"Pigment Cell & Melanoma Research","last_mentioned_on":1339485617,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/j.1755-148X.2012.01027.x&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fj.1755-148X.2012.01027.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1755-148X.2012.01027.x\/pdf","pmid":"22686288","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"618","subjects":["neoplasms","cellbiology"],"title":"Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090thermal Nanoelectroablation of UV\u00e2\u0080\u0090Induced Murine Melanomas Stimulates an Immune Response","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonthermal-nanoelectroablation-uvinduced-murine-melanomas-stimulates-immune-response"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6376562,"mean":5.987737073322,"rank":4483085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1661990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6376562,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83346,"mean":5.3706877917091,"rank":50742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":28911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83346,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":387,"mean":3.6699067357513,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":387,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.2046153846154,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
