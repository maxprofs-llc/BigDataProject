It often shows genetic instability and is associated with amplification (or gain) of various oncogenic genes or suppressive genes. Rsf-1, a subunit of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling complexes that mediates ATPase-dependent chromatin remodelling, confers tumour aggressiveness in certain carcinomas. The authors evaluate the Rsf-1 gene and expression status and its associations with clinicopathological features and survival in their UCUB collection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d02","authors":["Peir-In Liang","Li-Ching Wu","Jim Jinn-Chyuan Sheu","Ting-Feng Wu","Kun-Hung Shen","Yu-Hui Wang","Wen-Ren Wu","Yow-Ling Shiue","Hsuan-Ying Huang","Han-Ping Hsu","Yi-Hsien Chen","Li-Tzon Chen","Chien-Feng Li","Alex C Liao"],"doi":"10.1136\/jclinpath-2012-200897","endpage":"807","first_seen_on":"2012-06-09T10:16:07+00:00","issns":["1472-4146","0021-9746"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1346216138,"links":["http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2012\/06\/08\/jclinpath-2012-200897.short?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/jclinpath-2012-200897"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2012\/06\/08\/jclinpath-2012-200897.full.pdf","pmid":"22685262","pubdate":"2012-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Association of Clinical Pathologists","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"802","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Rsf-1\/HBXAP overexpression is independent of gene amplification and is associated with poor outcome in patients with urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rsf1hbxap-overexpression-independent-gene-amplification-associated-poor-outcome-patients-urinary-bla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8163518,"mean":6.8970466082141,"rank":3224024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4898474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8163518,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95225,"mean":5.6374592119634,"rank":30448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":64452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95225,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1840,"mean":4.3640217509516,"rank":852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1840,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.3958333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
