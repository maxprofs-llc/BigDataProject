The fluorescence intensity corresponding to the protected RNA fragment increased in a dose-dependent manner with respect to the complementary-strand RNA. More highly sensitive detection of miRNA by microchip electrophoresis than by conventional method using fluorescence-labeled riboprobe could be obtained in 180 s. An obvious increase in miR-222 expression induced by nerve growth factor in PC12 cells could be observed. These results clearly indicate the potential of microchip electrophoresis for the analysis of miRNA using RNase protection assay with a fluorescence-labeled riboprobe.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Shohei Yamamura"],"doi":"10.3390\/s120607576","first_seen_on":"2012-06-07T09:04:20+00:00","issns":["1424-8220",""],"issue":"6","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1339059844,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/12\/6\/7576"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/12\/6\/7576\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC3435990","pmid":"22969361","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Molecular Diversity Preservation International","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Detection of miRNA in Cell Cultures by Using Microchip Electrophoresis with a Fluorescence-Labeled Riboprobe","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-mirna-cell-cultures-using-microchip-electrophoresis-fluorescencelabeled-riboprobe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4282925,"mean":5.0205658482736,"rank":3398121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4282925,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75402,"mean":4.6065914245168,"rank":55058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75402,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":944,"mean":1.6293997879109,"rank":607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":944,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.46428571428571,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Mathematics":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1},"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rnomics\/statuses\/210658370447880193","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[780803],"posted_on":"2012-06-07T09:04:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Fabrice Leclerc","url":"http:\/\/about.me\/leclercfabrice","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/461944449832984577\/OFZs5M7c_normal.png","description":"#RNomics, #RNA biology, RNA #bioinformatics, #RNA_World & #evolution, technologies & resources, daily papers: http:\/\/bit.ly\/HaycPM & http:\/\/bit.ly\/18cyMMK","id_on_source":"rnomics","tweeter_id":"177684507","geo":{"lt":46,"ln":2,"country":"FR"},"followers":1969},"tweet_id":"210658370447880193"}]}}
