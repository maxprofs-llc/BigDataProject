Despite these difficulties, recent studies have demonstrated moderate success in implementing smoking cessation treatment in drug rehabilitation programs. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network sponsored a smoking cessation study in 13 community-based outpatient substance abuse rehabilitation programs across the country. The study evaluated the effectiveness of smoking cessation treatment provided as an adjunct to substance abuse treatment-as-usual. This report summarizes the practical and clinical experiences encountered at each of the study sites with regard to implementing the smoking cessation treatment intervention. Smoking behavior of the treatment clientele was assessed by anonymous survey at each site. In addition, sites were systematically characterized by using program review and assessment tools completed by the respective staff and program directors at the site. Survey and recruitment data indicated that cigarette smoking is more prevalent and that smoking cessation treatment is more feasible, in methadone maintenance treatment programs. Other factors associated with smoking behavior and with the recruitment of drug- and alcohol-dependent individuals into the smoking cessation treatment study are described.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b40","doi":"10.1097\/adm.0b013e31813872e4","first_seen_on":"2012-06-11T06:27:02+00:00","issns":["1932-0620"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Addiction Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1339395595,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journaladdictionmedicine\/Abstract\/2007\/09000\/Implementation_of_a_Smoking_Cessation_Treatment.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/journaladdictionmedicine\/2007\/09000\/Implementation_of_a_Smoking_Cessation_Treatment.6.pdf","pmid":"21768951","pubdate":"2007-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"154","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Implementation of a Smoking Cessation Treatment Study at Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Programs: Smoking Behavior and Treatment Feasibility Across Varied Community-based Outpatient Programs","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implementation-smoking-cessation-treatment-study-substance-abuse-rehabilitation-programs-smoking-beh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3095288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":973329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76377,"mean":4.8840199539122,"rank":48824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":16917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76377,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":499,"mean":5.7371164658635,"rank":439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":499,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":8.82475,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":2,"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/ASAMorg\/status\/212066615905353729","citation_ids":[785879],"posted_on":"2012-06-11T06:19:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Addiction Medicine","url":"http:\/\/www.asam.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/819621145200758784\/YETgkJuf_normal.jpg","description":"Increasing access to and improving quality of addiction treatment, educating physicians and the public, supporting research and prevention.
