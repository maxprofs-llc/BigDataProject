However, providing blood supply to the ischemic foot through the venous system instead of the arterial system may improve the circulation adequately for the healing process in the vascular compromised distal tissue. This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of pedal bypass with deep venous arterialization, one of the possible procedures to improve the circulation through the venous system in critically ischemic limbs and unreconstructable distal arteries. Twenty-six patients with critical limb ischemia and an unreconstructable distal artery of the lower extremities were included for the surgical procedure. Arterial bypass with distal anastomosis at the paramalleolar deep vein was carried out through a composite graft combined with adequate destruction of valve competency in the distal vein. The primary endpoint was complete healing of ischemic ulcer with amelioration of rest pain within six months. The secondary endpoints were the outcomes of survival, limb salvage and primary graft patency rate at six-month intervals to 24 months. Nineteen patients (73.1%) had complete healing of ischemic ulcer and disappearance of rest pain within six months. Six patients (23.1%) underwent major amputation. Perioperative mortality was 3.8%. After 24 months of follow-up study, the survival rate was 87.5%, whereas the limb salvage and graft patency rates were 76.02 and 49.17%, respectively. Pedal bypass with deep venous arterialization may be another therapeutic option to enhance the healing of ischemic ulcer and limb salvageability in patients with critical limb ischemia and unreconstructable distal artery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c54","authors":["Mutirangura P","Ruangsetakit C","Wongwanit C","Sermsathanasawadi N","Chinsakchai K"],"doi":"10.1258\/vasc.2010.oa0278","first_seen_on":"2012-06-13T10:31:07+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Vascular","last_mentioned_on":1339583461,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22008976?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22008976","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology"],"title":"Pedal bypass with deep venous arterialization: the therapeutic option in critical limb ischemia and unreconstructable distal arteries.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pedal-bypass-deep-venous-arterialization-therapeutic-option-critical-limb-ischemia-unreconstructable"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627879,"mean":4.9457436126612,"rank":2905358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627879,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73543,"mean":4.5744791275733,"rank":53943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73543,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":1.0472602739726,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
