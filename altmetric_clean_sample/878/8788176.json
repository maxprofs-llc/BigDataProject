In the parent strain E. coli BW25113 (wt) treated with ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, or streptomycin, dependence of survival from growth temperature was a V-shaped curve with the maximum sensitivity within the range corresponding to high growth rates (40-44\u00b0C). Significant inverse correlation was observed between log CFU at different temperatures and specific growth rate prior to antibiotic addition. This applied to most of the mutants, which exhibited higher resistance to the three antibiotics tested at nonoptimal temperatures (20 and 46\u00b0C) than at 37 and 40\u00b0C. No correlation was found between resistance to stress and antibiotics and expression of the antioxidant genes. The role of global regulators ppGpp and \u03c3(s) in E. coli resistance to antibiotics and nonoptimal temperatures was shown.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce4c","authors":["Smirnova, G V","Lepekhina, E V","Muzyka, N G","Oktyabrsky, O N"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-16T11:42:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0026-3656"],"issue":"1","journal":"Mikrobiologiia","last_mentioned_on":1466079608,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27301125?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27301125","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"[Role of Thiol Redox Systems in Escherichia coli Response to Thermal and Antibiotic Stresses].","type":"article","volume":"85"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7907411,"mean":6.6922707093667,"rank":5996635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1060783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7907411,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245274,"mean":11.863377656733,"rank":172391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":39710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245274,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":1.0089622641509,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/743390710666166272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8788176],"posted_on":"2016-06-16T10:32:11+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
