European Radiology at"],"citation":{"abstract":"To evaluate the influence of post-processing systems, intra- and inter-reader agreement on the variability of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in breast lesions.\nForty-one patients with 41 biopsy-proven breast lesions gave their informed consent and were included in this prospective IRB-approved study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed at 1.5\u00a0T using an EPI-DWI sequence, with b-values of 0 and 1000\u00a0s\/mm(2). Two radiologists (R1, R2) reviewed the images in separate sessions and measured the ADC for lesion, using MRI-workstation (S-WS), PACS-workstation (P-WS) and a commercial DICOM viewer (O-SW). Agreement was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman plots and coefficient of variation (CV).\nThirty-one malignant, two high-risk and eight benign mass-like lesions were analysed. Intra-reader agreement was almost perfect (ICC-R1\u2009=\u20090.974; ICC-R2\u2009=\u20090.990) while inter-reader agreement was substantial (ICC from 0.615 to 0.682). Bland-Altman plots revealed a significant bias in ADC values measured between O-SW and S-WS (P\u2009=\u20090.025), no further systematic differences were identified. CV varied from 6.8\u00a0% to 7.9\u00a0%.\nPost-processing systems may have a significant, although minor, impact on ADC measurements in breast lesions. While intra-reader agreement is high, the main source of ADC variability seems to be caused by inter-reader variation.\n\u2022 ADC provides quantitative information on breast lesions independent from the system used. \u2022 ADC measurement using different workstations and software systems is generally reliable. \u2022 Systematic, but minor, differences may occur between different post-processing systems. \u2022 Inter-reader agreement of ADC measurements exceeded intra-reader agreement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000286d","authors":["Paola Clauser","Magda Marcon","Marta Maieron","Chiara Zuiani","Massimo Bazzocchi","Pascal A.
