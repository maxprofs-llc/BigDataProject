Bilayer arrays of Au@Pt nanoparticles with platinum loadings of 0.50, 1.04, 1.44, and 1.75 \u03bcg cm(-2) (corresponding to 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 atomic layer coverage of platinum on nominally 5 nm gold core) were subjected to RF argon plasma treatment for various durations and their electrical conductivity, morphological evolution, and electrocatalytic activity characterized. Samples with monolayer and above platinum coverages exhibit maximum electrochemically active surface areas values of \u223c100 m(2)\/gpt and specific activities that are \u223c4\u00d7 to 6\u00d7 of a reference platinum nanoparticle bilayer array. The underlying gold core influences the structural evolution of the samples upon RF plasma treatment and leads to the formation of highly active Pt(110) facets on the surface at an optimal plasma treatment duration, which also corresponds to the onset of a sharp decline in lateral sheet resistance. The sample having a two atom thick platinum coating has the highest total mass activity of 48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 m(2)\/g(pt+au), corresponding to 44% Pt atom utilization, while also exhibiting enhanced CO tolerance as well as high methanol oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["Banerjee, Ipshita","Kumaran, V","Santhanam, Venugopal"],"doi":"10.1088\/0957-4484\/27\/30\/305401","first_seen_on":"2016-06-16T10:53:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1361-6528","0957-4484"],"issue":"30","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1466071272,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27302373?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27302373","pubdate":"2016-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"305401","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Fabrication of electrodes with ultralow platinum loading by RF plasma processing of self-assembled arrays of Au@Pt nanoparticles","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fabrication-electrodes-ultralow-platinum-loading-rf-plasma-processing-selfassembled-arrays-aupt-nano"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7907411,"mean":6.6922707093667,"rank":5996651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1060760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7907411,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245273,"mean":11.863497782054,"rank":172398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":39694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245273,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1556,"mean":6.0071241157556,"rank":1054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1556,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":2.4701176470588,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/assembly_papers\/statuses\/743382914633596929","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8787017],"posted_on":"2016-06-16T10:01:12+00:00","author":{"name":"assemblypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439371508528320512\/TDJfUNti_normal.png","description":"Papers on directed and self assembly","id_on_source":"assembly_papers","tweeter_id":"2364079946","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":332},"tweet_id":"743382914633596929"}]}}
