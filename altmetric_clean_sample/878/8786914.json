This technique has been translated to clinical levels in patients undergoing various surgical interventions including coronary artery bypass graft surgery, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, percutaneous coronary intervention and heart valve surgery. Adenosine is a master regulator of energy metabolism and reduces myocardial ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury. Furthermore, adenosine is a critical trigger as well as a mediator in RIPC-induced cardioprotection and scientists have demonstrated the role of adenosine by showing an increase in its levels in the systemic circulation during RIPC delivery. Furthermore, the blockade of cardioprotective effects of RIPC in the presence of specific adenosine receptor blockers and transgenic animals with targeted ablation of A1 receptors has also demonstrated its critical role in RIPC. The studies have shown that adenosine may elicit cardioprotection via activation of neurogenic pathway. The present review describes the possible role and mechanism of adenosine in mediating RIPC-induced cardioprotection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fb3cf058f610003014","authors":["Randhawa, Puneet Kaur","Jaggi, Amteshwar Singh","Puneet Kaur Randhawa","Amteshwar Singh Jaggi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.lfs.2016.05.009","endpage":"146","first_seen_on":"2016-06-16T10:48:20+00:00","issns":["1879-0631","00243205"],"journal":"Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1497225600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27157518","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.lfs.2016.05.009"],"pmid":"27157518","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"140","subjects":["biology","physiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Unraveling the role of adenosine in remote ischemic preconditioning-induced cardioprotection","type":"article","volume":"155","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unraveling-role-adenosine-remote-ischemic-preconditioninginduced-cardioprotection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":4453351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2325081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248386,"mean":12.051428016989,"rank":134621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":90126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248386,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2006,"mean":3.7376588528678,"rank":1234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2006,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.31875,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
