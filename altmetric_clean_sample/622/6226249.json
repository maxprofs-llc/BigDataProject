Here we used solvent-engineering and non-solvent dripping process with SnF2 as an inhibitor of Sn4+. However, excess SnF2 induce phase separation on the surface of the perovskite film. In this work, we report the homogeneous dispersion of SnF2 via the formation of the SnF2-pyrazine complex. Consequently, we fabricated FASnI3 PSCs with high reproducibility, achieving a high power conversion efficiency of 4.8 %. Furthermore, the encapsulated device showed a stable performance for over 100 days, maintaining 98 % of its initial efficiency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Seon Joo Lee"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b00142","first_seen_on":"2016-03-18T00:06:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126","0002-7863"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1463579754,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.6b00142","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b00142"],"pmid":"26960020","pubdate":"2016-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              Fabrication of Efficient Formamidinium Tin Iodide Perovskite Solar Cells through SnF\n              2\n              \u2013Pyrazine Complex\n            ","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fabrication-efficient-formamidinium-tin-iodide-perovskite-solar-cells-through-snf2pyrazine-complex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8332859,"mean":7.0230897799936,"rank":2127890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6201282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8332859,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286606,"mean":11.130735897838,"rank":91783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":194641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286606,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19198,"mean":5.311153096838,"rank":6221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":12973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19198,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":398,"mean":6.4940201511335,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":398,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":29,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
