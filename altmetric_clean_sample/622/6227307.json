Activation of the trigeminovascular system (TVS) has an important function in this disorder and neurogenic inflammation and central sensitization are important mechanisms underlying this condition. Nitroglycerin (NTG) infusion in rats closely mimics a universally accepted human model of migraine. Electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion (ESTG) of rats can also activate TVS during a migraine attack. Numerous studies have revealed that phosphorylated extracellular signal\u2011regulated kinase (p\u2011ERK), calcitonin gene\u2011related peptide (CGRP) and cyclooxygenase\u20112 (COX\u20112) are involved in pain and nociceptive pathways. However, few studies have examined whether p\u2011ERK, CGRP and COX\u20112 are involved in neurogenic inflammation and central sensitization. In the present study, the expression of p\u2011ERK, CGRP and COX\u20112 was detected in the dura mater, trigeminal ganglion (TG) and spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis in NTG\u2011induced rats and ESTG models by immunohistochemistry. The three areas considered were crucial components of the TVS. The selective COX\u20112 inhibitor nimesulide was used in ESTG rats to examine the association between p\u2011ERK, CGRP and COX\u20112. The results demonstrated that p\u2011ERK, CGRP and COX\u20112 mediated neurogenic inflammation and central sensitization in migraine. In addition, the expression of p\u2011ERK and CGRP was attenuated by the COX-2 inhibitor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Dong, Xiaomeng","Hu, Yaozhi","Jing, Long","Chen, Jinbo"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2015.3616","first_seen_on":"2016-03-18T04:59:21+00:00","issns":["1791-3004","1791-2997"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1458277144,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25892078?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25892078","pubdate":"2015-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Role of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, calcitonin gene-related peptide and cyclooxygenase-2 in experimental rat models of migraine","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-phosphorylated-extracellular-signalregulated-kinase-calcitonin-generelated-peptide-cyclooxygena"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7408484,"mean":6.4406978049309,"rank":3806992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2074946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7408484,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279900,"mean":10.842070111004,"rank":151728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":99397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279900,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1702,"mean":1.4739106407995,"rank":323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":1152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1702,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":1.0858895705521,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
