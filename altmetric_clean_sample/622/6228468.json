The aim of this study was to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of the methanol extract of S.\u00a0chinensis (MESC) on 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced contact dermatitis (CD) in mice. The effects of MESC on ear thickness and weight, histopathological changes, immune cell filtration and cytokine production were investigated in DNFB-induced CD mice. Topical application of MESC effectively inhibited ear swelling (30 or 300\u00a0\u00b5g on the left ear, P<0.001; 30\u00a0\u00b5g on the right ear, P<0.001). MESC also inhibited hyperplasia, spongiosis (100\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.05 and 300\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.001, respectively) and immune cell infiltration (100\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.05; 300\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.001) induced by DNFB. In addition, MESC suppressed increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2011\u03b1 levels (100 or 300\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.05), interferon (INF)\u2011\u03b3 (30\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.05; 100\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.01; 300\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.001), interleukin (IL)\u20116 (300\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.05) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)\u20111 (30\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.05; 100\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.01; 300\u00a0\u00b5g\/ear, P<0.001). These results suggest that the anti\u2011inflammatory effects of MESC are mediated by the reduced production of TNF\u2011\u03b1, IFN\u2011\u03b3, IL\u20116 and MCP\u20111, and that MESC has potential use for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Lee, Hee Jung","Jo, Suzy","Ryu, Jeonghyun","Jeong, Han-Sol","Lee, Guemsan","Ryu, Mi Heon","Jung, Myeong Ho","Kim, Hyungwoo","Kim, Byung Joo"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2015.3618","first_seen_on":"2016-03-18T10:01:36+00:00","issns":["1791-3004","1791-2997"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1458295266,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25892286?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25892286","pubdate":"2015-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Effects of Schisandra chinensis Turcz. fruit on contact dermatitis induced by dinitrofluorobenzene in mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-schisandra-chinensis-turcz-fruit-contact-dermatitis-induced-dinitrofluorobenzene-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7408484,"mean":6.4406978049309,"rank":5604738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":996360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7408484,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279900,"mean":10.842063501477,"rank":196450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279900,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1702,"mean":1.4739106407995,"rank":623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1702,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":1.0858895705521,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/710767981345640449","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6228468],"posted_on":"2016-03-18T10:01:06+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
