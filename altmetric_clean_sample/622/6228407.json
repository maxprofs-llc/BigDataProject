However, their protective effects on kidney tissue against ischemia-reperfusion injury remain unclear. We aimed to determine whether curcumin or dexmedetomidine prevents renal tissue from injury that was induced by hind limb ischemia-reperfusion in rats. Fifty rats were divided into five groups: sham, control, curcumin (CUR) group (200\u2009mg\/kg curcumin, n\u2009=\u200910), dexmedetomidine (DEX) group (25\u2009\u03bcg\/kg dexmedetomidine, n\u2009=\u200910), and curcumin-dexmedetomidine (CUR-DEX) group (200\u2009mg\/kg curcumin and 25\u2009\u03bcg\/kg dexmedetomidine). Curcumin and dexmedetomidine were administered intraperitoneally immediately after the end of 4\u2009h ischemia, just 5\u2009min before reperfusion. The extremity re-perfused for 2\u2009h and then blood samples were taken and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidative status (TOS) levels, and oxidative stress index (OSI) were measured, and renal tissue samples were histopathologically examined. The TAC activity levels in blood samples were significantly lower in the control than the other groups (p\u2009<\u20090.01 for all comparisons). The TOS activity levels in blood samples were significantly higher in Control group and than the other groups (p\u2009<\u2009\u20090.01 for all comparison). The OSI were found to be significantly increased in the control group compared to others groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for all comparisons). Histopathological examination revealed less severe lesions in the sham, CUR, DEX, and CUR-DEX groups, compared with the control group (p\u2009< 0.01). Rat hind limb ischemia-reperfusion causes histopathological changes in the kidneys. Curcumin and dexmedetomidine administered intraperitoneally was effective in reducing oxidative stress and renal histopathologic injury in an acute hind limb I\/R rat model.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5323cf058f610004492","authors":["Karahan, M A","Yalcin, S","Aydogan, H","B\u00fcy\u00fckfirat, E","K\u00fcc\u00fck, A","Kocarslan, S","Y\u00fcce, H H","Task\u0131n, A","Aksoy, N"],"doi":"10.3109\/0886022x.2016.1157746","endpage":"6","first_seen_on":"2016-03-18T09:50:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-6049","0886-022X"],"journal":"Renal Failure","last_mentioned_on":1458294594,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26983591"],"pmid":"26983591","pubdate":"2016-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Curcumin and dexmedetomidine prevents oxidative stress and renal injury in hind limb ischemia\/reperfusion injury in a rat model","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/curcumin-dexmedetomidine-prevents-oxidative-stress-renal-injury-hind-limb-ischemiareperfusion-injury-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7408484,"mean":6.4406978049309,"rank":6412098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7408484,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279899,"mean":10.842106881792,"rank":236355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279899,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331,"mean":2.3506424242424,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.66875,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drtars\/statuses\/710765161817231360","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6228407],"posted_on":"2016-03-18T09:49:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Tars the Robot","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_6_normal.png","id_on_source":"drtars","tweeter_id":"3982165613","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"710765161817231360"}]}}
