The authors conducted a focus group study with physiotherapists and physical rehabilitation therapists working with patients whose treatments are compensated by the Quebec Workers' Compensation Board with the goal of exploring quality of care and ethical issues. Three main themes were identified: (1) systemic factors, (2) complexity in treatment decisions and (3) inequality of care. Although physiotherapy professionals strive to give these patients the best possible care, patients might not always be provided with optimal or equal treatment. When compared with other patients, there appear to be differences with respect to access to care and types of services offered to injured workers, raising equity concerns. Factors that shape and constrain quality of physiotherapy services for injured workers need to be addressed to improve care for these patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67b3cf058f6100097ac","authors":["Anne Hudon","Maude Lalibert\u00e9","Matthew Hunt","Debbie Ehrmann Feldman"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-10T22:08:30+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1715-6572"],"issue":"3","journal":"Healthcare Policy","last_mentioned_on":1499560772,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4748341\/"],"pmid":"25947032","pubdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Longwoods Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"32","title":"Quality of Physiotherapy Services for Injured Workers Compensated by Workers' Compensation in Quebec: A Focus Group Study of Physiotherapy Professionals.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quality-physiotherapy-services-injured-workers-compensated-workers-compensation-quebec-focus-group-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183187,"mean":6.9217013823156,"rank":7081537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174734,"mean":11.333536962108,"rank":141587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174734,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":4.064261682243,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
