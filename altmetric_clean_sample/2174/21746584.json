Patient care units that previously had no decentralized pharmacy services were evaluated to identify opportunities for expansion. Metrics analyzed included number of medication orders verified per hour, number of pharmacy dosing consultations, and number of patient discharge counseling sessions. A pilot study was conducted to assess the feasibility of this service and potential resident learning opportunities. A learning experience description was drafted, and feedback was solicited regarding the development of educational components utilized throughout the rotation. Pharmacists who were providing services to similar patient populations were identified to serve as preceptors. Staff pharmacists were deployed to previously uncovered patient care units, with pharmacy residents providing decentralized services on previously covered areas. A rotating preceptor schedule was developed based on geographic proximity and clinical expertise. An initial postimplementation assessment of this resident-driven service revealed that pharmacy residents provided a comparable level of pharmacy services to that of staff pharmacists. Feedback collected from nurses, physicians, and pharmacy staff also supported residents' ability to operate sufficiently in this role to optimize patient care.\nA learning experience developed for pharmacy residents in a large medical center enabled the expansion of decentralized clinical services without requiring additional pharmacist full-time equivalents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021fe","authors":["Hill, John D.","Williams, Jonathan P.","Barnes, Julie F.","Greenlee, Katie M.","Cardiology, BCPS-AQ","Leonard, Mandy C."],"doi":"10.2146\/ajhp160135","first_seen_on":"2017-07-10T22:03:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1079-2082","1535-2900"],"issue":"14","journal":"American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy","last_mentioned_on":1499896464,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28687553?otool=iesciblib&utm_content=bufferc1a36&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28687553?otool=iesciblib&utm_content=buffer78809&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajhp.org\/content\/ajhp\/74\/14\/1085.full.pdf","pmid":"28687553","pubdate":"2017-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Health System Pharmacists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacy","hospitals"],"title":"Development of a pharmacy resident rotation to expand decentralized clinical pharmacy services","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-pharmacy-resident-rotation-expand-decentralized-clinical-pharmacy-services"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.3,"score_history":{"1y":5.3,"6m":5.3,"3m":5.3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200876,"mean":6.9354244123888,"rank":1515137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6681573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200876,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182683,"mean":11.343341139247,"rank":42602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":139809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182683,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1489,"mean":4.6339489247312,"rank":291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":1195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1489,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":3.8169230769231,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":4,"US":3}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bibliosalut\/statuses\/884533469703016449","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21746584],"posted_on":"2017-07-10T22:03:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Bibliosalut","url":"http:\/\/www.bibliosalut.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/881754181480194048\/sOQGEWYO_normal.jpg","description":"Biblioteca Virtual de Ci\u00e8ncies de la Salut de les Illes Balears.
