Isolated PMNs from the following subjects were studied: healthy adult volunteers (n = 28), healthy newborns (n = 21), newborns undergoing major surgery (n = 7), and older infants and children undergoing major surgery (n = 14). Chemotaxis was measured by a micropore filter assay, and actin polymerization was measured by flow cytometry. Blood samples from surgical patients were obtained preoperatively, hourly during the procedure, immediately postoperatively, and 48 hours after surgery. Mean preoperative newborn PMN chemotaxis was similar to that of healthy newborn PMN, and mean preoperative PMN chemotaxis in children was similar to that of healthy adults. There were no significant alterations in PMN chemotaxis during or after major surgery in neonates or children. Peak PMN actin polymerization, after stimulation with formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP) (10 nm), was significantly diminished in healthy neonates compared with adults (P < .005). Preoperative surgical neonates had similar peak PMN actin polymerization levels to those of healthy newborns, and older preoperative children had similar levels to adults. PMN actin polymerization did not significantly change during or after major surgery. Despite reductions in PMN chemotaxis and actin polymerization in healthy neonates, there is no further impairment of these PMN functions during or after major surgery. Our data suggest that PMN chemotactic function is resistant to the stress of uncomplicated major surgery in neonates and children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd6","authors":["Christine Merry","Prem Puri","Denis J Reen"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0022-3468(97)90626-6","first_seen_on":"2017-07-10T18:44:28+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["00223468","0022-3468"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Surgery (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1492646400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/s0022-3468(97)90626-6","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0022-3468(97)90626-6"],"pmid":"9200076","pubdate":"1997-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pediatrics"],"title":"Effect of major surgery on neutrophil chemotaxis and actin polymerization in neonates and children","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-major-surgery-neutrophil-chemotaxis-actin-polymerization-neonates-children-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":2033471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4943751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125635,"mean":10.934973016859,"rank":39119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":85196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125635,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2022,"mean":2.1628985650668,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2022,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.5552631578947,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"General best practice guidelines for immunization : best practices guidance of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)","url":"https:\/\/stacks.cdc.gov\/view\/cdc\/46256\/cdc_46256_DS1.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[1957880,21741481,16149799,15722252,16149798,16149794,16149792,6716498,2159471,6719719,16895006,21741487,4633793,4633759,21741488,15702001,499256,21741494,15683847,16149790,1290858,3672493,21741502,16149789,16149786,16752513,16149783,4633779,4917572,4917571,21741516,16149772,21741521,21741525,21741529,21741531,21741533,21741535,21741536,21741539,21741543,21741547,21741553,21741558,21741562,21741566,826310,21741571,16149782,1881243,3383091,2412000,898937,15680371,2411963,2265435,2063690,3314640,21741581,16149744,16149743,3423558,1608468,21741597,4202167,3211629,16149741,16682551,16149732,16149729,20479969,16205032,3323207,15590781,1182553,21741610,219984,16947687,6717807,6110145,16149768,3275950,3289037,12923588,21741627,583116,699083,16149767,3081559,16149761,21741636,772023,21741655,16149755,16149747,15780849,16149746,5739740,6712988,6230380,250405,1592335,15637419,16149737,3134173,16149735,14985642,16149708,16153027,6091881,2076669,16149793,1009648,1009611,16149738,16149734,1055877,14983708,16149728,16149725,21741707,996159,1743597,16149721,16149705,3395976,2324210,857987,126809,769738,126761,16152854,16152852,16757871,6719377,16149697,21741722,16149692,16149689,1444953,108851,3454939,3453097,16149686,21741739,16149738,1009648,5739740,16149746,16149767,21741533,21741529,21741525,3672493,16149786],"posted_on":"2017-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","description":"CDC is America\u2019s leading public health agency, dedicated to saving and protecting the health of Americans.
