Antiretroviral therapy with atazanavir delays progression of atherosclerosis markers; whether this reduces cardiovascular disease event risk compared with other antiretroviral regimens is currently unknown.\nPopulation-based, non-interventional, historical cohort study conducted from July 1, 2003, through December 31, 2015.\nVeterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals and clinics throughout the United States.\nTreatment-na\u00efve patients with HIV infection (N\u200a=\u200a9500).\nInitiating antiretroviral regimens containing atazanavir, other protease inhibitors (PIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), or integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs).\nIncidence rates of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and all-cause mortality within each regimen. Atazanavir versus other PI, NNRTI, or INSTI covariate-adjusted hazard ratios using Cox proportional hazards models and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).\nIncidence rates for MI, stroke, and all-cause mortality with atazanavir-containing regimens (5.2, 10.4, and 16.0 per 1000 patient-years, respectively) were lower than with regimens containing other PIs (10.2, 21.9, and 23.3 per 1000 patient-years), NNRTIs (7.5, 15.9, and 17.5 per 1000 patient-years), or INSTIs (13.0, 33.1, and 21.5 per 1000 patient-years). After IPTW, adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for MI, stroke, and all-cause mortality with atazanavir-containing regimens versus all non-atazanavir-containing regimens were 0.59 (0.41-0.84), 0.64 (0.50-0.81), and 0.90 (0.73-1.11), respectively.\nAmong treatment-na\u00efve HIV-infected patients in the VHA initiating atazanavir-containing regimens, risk of both MI and stroke were significantly lower than in those initiating regimens containing other PIs, NNRTIs, or INSTIs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006920","authors":["Lafleur, Joanne","Bress, Adam P.","Rosenblatt, Lisa","Crook, Jacob","Sax, Paul E.","MYERS, Joel","Ritchings, Corey"],"doi":"10.1097\/qad.0000000000001594","first_seen_on":"2017-07-10T22:15:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0269-9370","1473-5571"],"journal":"AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1499749119,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Cardiovascular_outcomes_among_HIV_infected.97436.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/9000\/00000\/Cardiovascular_outcomes_among_HIV_infected.97436.pdf","pmid":"28692532","pubdate":"2017-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Cardiovascular outcomes among HIV-infected veterans receiving atazanavir","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Cardiovascular_outcomes_among_HIV_infected.97436.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cardiovascular-outcomes-among-hivinfected-veterans-receiving-atazanavir"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":1.6,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8193064,"mean":6.9264840328884,"rank":3828632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4331656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8193064,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180406,"mean":11.316386120119,"rank":80368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":98651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180406,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3582,"mean":4.8616861211952,"rank":2556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3582,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":3.111875,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AIDS_Journal\/statuses\/884536477090271233","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21746705],"posted_on":"2017-07-10T22:15:04+00:00","author":{"name":"AIDS Journal","url":"http:\/\/www.aidsonline.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1653594469\/AIDS_cover_square_normal.jpg","description":"Publishing the very latest ground breaking research on HIV and AIDS, AIDS has the highest impact of all AIDS-related journals.","id_on_source":"AIDS_Journal","tweeter_id":"419442651","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":923},"tweet_id":"884536477090271233"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/marval13\/statuses\/884625302193934342","license":"gnip","rt":["AIDS_Journal"],"citation_ids":[21746705],"posted_on":"2017-07-11T04:08:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Marisol Valenzuela","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/804203541002907649\/p_MUK7Ol_normal.jpg","description":"Mujer, sonorense, m\u00e9dica, salubrista, epidemi\u00f3loga","id_on_source":"marval13","tweeter_id":"35140160","geo":{"lt":23,"ln":-102,"country":"MX"},"followers":530},"tweet_id":"884625302193934342"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cpvfarvalme\/statuses\/884638043361222656","license":"gnip","rt":["AIDS_Journal"],"citation_ids":[21746705],"posted_on":"2017-07-11T04:58:39+00:00","author":{"name":"AF en VIH, VHC y VHB","url":"http:\/\/farmaciavalmecpv.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3374760685\/7bf630000ca0d4e699b3b1590b6efa06_normal.png","description":"Since 2009 helping to obtain the pharmacoterapeutic aims of our HIV, HCV or HBV patients and re-defining the Pharmaceutical Care.
