However, its potential role in regulating breast cancer metastasis remains unclear. MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) are a broad family of zinc-biding endopeptidases that participate in the ECM (extracellular matrix) degradation that accompanies cancer cell invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. In this study, we found up-regulation of CIAPIN1 by lentiviral expression vector inhibited the migration, invasion and MMPs expression of MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, CIAPIN1 over-expression decreased NHE1 (Na(+)\/H(+) exchanger 1) expression and ERK1\/2 phosphorylation. Importantly, treating CIAPIN1 over-expressed MDA-MB-231 cells with the NHE1 specific inhibitor, Cariporide, further inhibited the metastatic capacity, MMPs expression and phosphorylated ERK1\/2. Treatment with the MEK1 specific inhibitor, PD98059, induced nearly the same suppression of CIAPIN1 over-expression-dependent migration, invasion and MMPs expression as was observed with Cariporide. Further, Cariporide and PD98059 synergistically suppressed migration, invasion and MMPs expression of CIAPIN1 over-expressed MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, our results revealed the mechanism by which CIAPIN1 targeted NHE1 to mediate migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through regulation of MMPs via ERK1\/2 signaling pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002890","authors":["Jian Wang","Hua Xu","Qi Wang","Hairui Zhang","Yani Lin","Hongju Zhang","Qinghua Li","Tianxiang Pang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yexcr.2015.02.012","first_seen_on":"2015-03-01T11:23:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2422"],"journal":"Experimental Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1425221051,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25724898?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25724898","pubdate":"2015-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"CIAPIN1 targets Na(+)\/H(+) exchanger 1 to mediate MDA-MB-231 cells\u00b4 metastasis through regulation of MMPs via ERK1\/2 signaling pathway.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ciapin1-targets-nasupsuphsupsup-exchanger-1-mediate-mdamb231-cells-metastasis-through-regulation-mmp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4817786,"mean":5.7559003126974,"rank":2390496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2282059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4817786,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143639,"mean":10.093366226208,"rank":72884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":64210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143639,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1114,"mean":2.3230134770889,"rank":623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1114,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":0.958,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TumImmTx_papers\/status\/571994054218522625","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3743097],"posted_on":"2015-03-01T11:23:04+00:00","author":{"name":"TumImmTxpapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"TumImmTx_papers","tweeter_id":"2881001471","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":15},"tweet_id":"571994054218522625"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/572044668185128961","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3743097],"posted_on":"2015-03-01T14:44:11+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
