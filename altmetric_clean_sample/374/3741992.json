The innate immune system exerts its function via soluble and cellular components. Recently, function and kinetics of immune cells after MI have been clarified using new innovative technology. Therefore, herein, we will discuss the function of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages in the pathophysiology of cardiac remodeling after MI in basic as well as clinical science.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007057","authors":["Hisahito Shinagawa","Stefan Frantz"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11897-015-0255-7","first_seen_on":"2015-02-28T21:02:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1546-9549"],"journal":"Current Heart Failure Reports","last_mentioned_on":1425157264,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25721354?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25721354","pubdate":"2015-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiac Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vascular Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Cellular Immunity and Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction: Role of Neutrophils, Monocytes, and Macrophages.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cellular-immunity-cardiac-remodeling-after-myocardial-infarction-role-neutrophils-monocytes-macropha"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4814322,"mean":5.7520175995776,"rank":4030081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4814322,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143609,"mean":10.078836555067,"rank":118763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143609,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":1.3359761904762,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
