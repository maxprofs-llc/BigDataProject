Staging laparoscopy combined with peritoneal cytology can detect advanced disease that may not be apparent on other staging investigations. The aim of this study was to determine the current value of staging laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology in light of the ubiquitous use of computed tomography in all oesophagogastric cancers and the addition of positron emission tomography in oesophageal cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a33","doi":"10.1308\/003588414x14055925061270","first_seen_on":"2015-03-02T21:43:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"journal":"Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England","last_mentioned_on":1425332879,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/rcse\/arcs\/2015\/00000097\/00000002\/art00023"],"pmid":"25723693","pubdate":"2015-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"The current role of staging laparoscopy in oesophagogastric cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-role-staging-laparoscopy-oesophagogastric-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4823280,"mean":5.7592269686273,"rank":2223598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2477883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4823280,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142973,"mean":10.120013806899,"rank":66656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":71530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142973,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":536,"mean":2.7292785046729,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":536,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.996875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/UpperGISurg\/status\/572513709668618240","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3747300],"posted_on":"2015-03-02T21:47:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrew Kennedy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/593655421249916928\/kVsq1nyv_normal.jpg","description":"Bio Degradable","id_on_source":"UpperGISurg","tweeter_id":"277061664","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1116},"tweet_id":"572513709668618240"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rjt1978\/status\/572512615957704705","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3747300],"posted_on":"2015-03-02T21:43:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Richard Thompson","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000358254796\/f5f91ec93fea489121eddc1537e73c2c_normal.jpeg","description":"Christian, surgeon.
