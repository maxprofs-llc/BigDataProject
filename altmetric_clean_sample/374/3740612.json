Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) is a useful plant with anti-diabetic properties in traditional medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bilberry against DM. Diabetes was induced using intraperitoneal injection of alloxan (120 mg\/kg body weight (bw)). Bilberry powder (2g\/day) and glibenclamide (positive control; 0.6 mg\/kgbw) were administered for 4 weeks following alloxan injection. Serum glucose, insulin, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined at baseline and at 2(nd) and 4(th) week of the study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ee9","authors":["Asgary S","RafieianKopaei M","Sahebkar A","Shamsi F","Goli-Malekabadi N","Sedigheh Asgary","Mahmood RafieianKopaei","Amirhossein Sahebkar","Fatemeh Shamsi","Najmeh Goli-malekabadi"],"doi":"10.1002\/jsfa.7144","first_seen_on":"2015-02-28T08:00:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00225142"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture","last_mentioned_on":1483956000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25704796?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25704796","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25704796"],"pmid":"25704796","pubdate":"2015-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects of Vaccinium myrtillus fruit in experimentally-induced diabetes (antidiabetic effect of Vaccinium myrtillus fruit).","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antihyperglycemic-antihyperlipidemic-effects-vaccinium-myrtillus-fruit-experimentally-induced-diabet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.75,"score_history":{"1y":9,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029085,"mean":6.8046097213542,"rank":682189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7343911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029085,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202275,"mean":9.2122896368294,"rank":24509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":177625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202275,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1378,"mean":3.0369353667393,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1378,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2.4612195121951,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
