The performance of a standard commercial DNA extraction kit (MOBIO PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit) and three modified protocols of this kit: soil pellet re-extraction (RE); an additional 24-h lysis incubation step at room temperature (RT); and 24-h lysis incubation step at 55\u00a0\u00b0C (55) were compared using high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer I ribosomal DNA. DNA yield was not correlated with fungal diversity and the four DNA extraction methods displayed distinct fungal community profiles for individual samples, with some phyla detected exclusively using the modified methods. Application of a 24\u00a0h lysis step will provide a more complete inventory of fungal biodiversity, and re-extraction of the residual soil pellet offers a novel tool for increasing discriminatory power between forensic soil samples.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003c99","authors":["Jennifer M Young","Laura S Weyrich","Laurence J Clarke","Alan Cooper","Young JM","Weyrich LS","Clarke LJ","Cooper A","Jennifer M.
