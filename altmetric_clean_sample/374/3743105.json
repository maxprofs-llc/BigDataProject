We have shown previously that the combinations of green tea polyphenols (GTPs), a dietary DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and sulforaphane (SFN), a dietary histone deacetylase inhibitor, reactivate ER\u03b1 expression in ER\u03b1-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, we investigated the functional significance of ER\u03b1 reactivation in the reactivation of silenced tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in ER\u03b1-negative human breast cancer cells. We found that the treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with the combinations of GTPs and SFN leads to the reactivation of silenced TSGs such as p21(CIP1\/WAF1) and KLOTHO through active chromatin modifications. Further, GTPs- and SFN-mediated reactivation of TSGs was, at least in part, dependent on ER\u03b1 reactivation in ER\u03b1-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that a novel combination of bioactive dietary supplements could further be explored as an effective therapeutic option against hormonal refractory breast cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310e","authors":["Sonam Sinha","Samriddhi Shukla","Sajid Khan","Trygve O Tollefsbol","Syed M Meeran","Sinha S","Shukla S","Khan S","Tollefsbol TO","Meeran SM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mce.2015.02.020","endpage":"114","first_seen_on":"2015-03-01T11:24:17+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1872-8057","0303-7207","03037207"],"journal":"Molecular & Cellular Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1425374282,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25725373?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25725373?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25725373","pubdate":"2015-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"102","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","endocrinology"],"title":"Epigenetic reactivation of p21<sup>CIP1\/WAF1<\/sup> and KLOTHO by a combination of bioactive dietary supplements is partially ER\u03b1-dependent in ER\u03b1-negative human breast cancer cells.","type":"article","volume":"406","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-reactivation-p21cip1waf1-klotho-combination-bioactive-dietary-supplements-partially-er%CE%B1de"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4828860,"mean":5.7628152439343,"rank":2395701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2287679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4828860,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143870,"mean":10.081384565125,"rank":72977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":64332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143870,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":817,"mean":2.5002794117647,"rank":412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":817,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.9,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
