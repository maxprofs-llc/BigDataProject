The major commercial antibiotic classes often fail to combat common bacteria. Although antimicrobial peptides are able to control bacterial infections by interfering with microbial metabolism and physiological processes in several ways, a large number of cases of resistance to antibiotic peptide classes have also been reported. To gain a better understanding of the resistance process various technologies have been applied. Here we discuss multiple strategies by which bacteria could develop enhanced antimicrobial peptide resistance, focusing on sub-cellular regions from the surface to deep inside, evaluating bacterial membranes, cell walls and cytoplasmic metabolism. Moreover, some high-throughput methods for antimicrobial resistance detection and discrimination are also examined.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Simone Maria-Neto","Keyla Caroline de Almeida","Maria Ligia Rodrigues Macedo","Oct\u00e1vio Luiz Franco"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbamem.2015.02.017","first_seen_on":"2015-03-01T11:24:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0006-3002","00052736"],"journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1425439976,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25724815?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbamem.2015.02.017"],"pmid":"25724815","pubdate":"2015-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Understanding bacterial resistance to antimicrobial peptides: from the surface to deep inside.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/understanding-bacterial-resistance-antimicrobial-peptides-surface-deep-inside"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4833230,"mean":5.76720096441,"rank":2397904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2290026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4833230,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143974,"mean":10.070864384294,"rank":73031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":64378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143974,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4529,"mean":2.6925318021201,"rank":2940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4529,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":1.5046103896104,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
