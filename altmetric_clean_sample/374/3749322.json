One example is the chiral nanoporous networks that can be created via controlled self-assembly of star-shaped molecules under 2D confinement. In this contribution we use computer modeling to predict the formation of molecular networks in adsorbed overlayers comprising cruciform molecular building blocks equipped with discrete interaction centers. To that end, we employ the Monte Carlo simulation method combined with a coarse-grained representation of the adsorbed molecules which are treated as collections of interconnected segments. The interaction centers within the molecules are represented by active segments whose number and distribution are adjusted. Our particular focus is on those distributions that produce prochiral molecules able to occur in adsorbed configurations being mirror images of each other (surface enantiomers). We demonstrate that, depending on size, aspect ratio, and intramolecular distribution of active sites, the surface enantiomers can co-crystallize or segregate into extended homochiral domains with largely diversified nanosized cavities. The insights from our theoretical studies can be helpful in designing 2D chiral porous networks with potential applications in enantioselective adsorption and asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis.
