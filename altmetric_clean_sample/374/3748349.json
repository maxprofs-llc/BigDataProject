A systematic review was carried out of literature published between 1986 and 2012 from EBSCO, ProQuest, Science Direct, Emerald, and JSTOR. The search included original research articles that presented evaluated interventions. Books, dissertations, gray literature, and theoretical reviews were excluded. Findings revealed a total of fourteen studies focused on the evaluation of: the IMAGE project, female sex workers, life skills and risk behavior reduction, adherence to treatment, and children and their families. Most of these interventions have shown to have beneficial effects, although results depend on: the type of program, monitoring, sustainability of microcredits, and contextual conditions. The findings of this review should be complemented with interventions carried out by various NGOs and microfinance institutions in different countries that present their results in a dissimilar way.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021b9","authors":["Marcela Arrivillaga","Juan Pablo Salcedo"],"doi":"10.1521\/aeap.2014.26.1.13","first_seen_on":"2015-03-03T04:26:12+00:00","issns":["1943-2755"],"journal":"AIDS Education & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1425356755,"links":["http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/259874925_A_Systematic_Review_of_Microfinance-Based_Interventions_for_HIVAIDS_Prevention"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Marcela_Arrivillaga\/publication\/259874925_A_Systematic_Review_of_Microfinance-Based_Interventions_for_HIVAIDS_Prevention\/links\/54ebb8480cf2a030519496fd.pdf","pmid":"24450275","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome","education"],"title":"A Systematic Review of Microfinance-Based Interventions for HIV\/AIDS Prevention.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-review-microfinancebased-interventions-hivaids-prevention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4828860,"mean":5.7628152439343,"rank":2563359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1610365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4828860,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143442,"mean":10.109619983129,"rank":80534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":46566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143442,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":2.7561182795699,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":6.375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
