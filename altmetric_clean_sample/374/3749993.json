Glucose starvation promptly induces changes in mRNA and noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcription. We previously reported that glucose starvation induces long ncRNA (lncRNA) transcription in the 5' segment of a fission yeast gluconeogenesis gene (fbp1(+) ), which leads to stepwise chromatin alteration around the fbp1(+) promoter and to subsequent robust gene activation. Here, we analyzed genomewide transcription by strand-specific RNA sequencing, together with chromatin landscape by immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Clustering analysis showed that distinct mRNAs and ncRNAs are induced at the early, middle and later stages of cellular response to glucose starvation. The starvation-induced transcription depends substantially on the stress-responsive transcription factor Atf1. Using a new computer program that examines dynamic changes in expression patterns, we identified ncRNAs with similar behavior to the fbp1(+) lncRNA. We confirmed that there are continuous lncRNAs associated with local reduction of histone density. Overlapping with the regions for transcription of these lncRNAs, antisense RNAs are antagonistically transcribed under glucose-rich conditions. These results suggest that Atf1-dependent integrated networks of mRNA and lncRNA govern drastic changes in cell physiology in response to glucose starvation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293e","authors":["Arisa Oda","Naomichi Takemata","Yoshito Hirata","Tomoichiro Miyoshi","Yutaka Suzuki","Sumio Sugano","Kunihiro Ohta","Oda, Arisa","Takemata, Naomichi","Hirata, Yoshito","Miyoshi, Tomoichiro","Suzuki, Yutaka","Sugano, Sumio","Ohta, Kunihiro"],"doi":"10.1111\/gtc.12229","endpage":"407","first_seen_on":"2015-03-03T14:15:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2443","1356-9597"],"issue":"5","journal":"Genes to Cells","last_mentioned_on":1425823180,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25728061?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gtc.12229\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gtc.12229\/pdf","pmid":"25728061","pubdate":"2015-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"392","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Dynamic transition of transcription and chromatin landscape during fission yeast adaptation to glucose starvation","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamic-transition-transcription-chromatin-landscape-during-fission-yeast-adaptation-glucose-starvat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6396843,"mean":5.9825057486175,"rank":2354589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3947100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6396843,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169427,"mean":9.73327012383,"rank":67561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":98356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169427,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":487,"mean":3.3427037037037,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":487,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":5.3083333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
