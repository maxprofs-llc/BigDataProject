PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular disorder characterized by chronic inflammation of the aortic wall. Low concentrations of vitamin D3 are associated with AAA development; however, the potential direct effect of vitamin D3 on AAA remains unknown. This study evaluates the effect of oral treatment with the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) ligand, calcitriol, on dissecting AAA induced by angiotensin-II (Ang-II) infusion in apoE(-\/-) mice.\nOral treatment with calcitriol reduced Ang-II-induced dissecting AAA formation in apoE(-\/-) mice, which was unrelated to systolic blood pressure or plasma cholesterol concentrations. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analysis demonstrated a significant increase in macrophage infiltration, neovessel formation, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9, chemokine (CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL1) and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in suprarenal aortic walls of apoE(-\/-) mice infused with Ang-II, and all were significantly reduced by cotreatment with calcitriol. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1\/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and nuclear factor-\u03baB was also decreased in the suprarenal aortas of apoE(-\/-) mice cotreated with calcitriol. These effects were accompanied by a marked increase in VDR-RXR interaction in the aortas of calcitriol-treated mice. In vitro, VDR activation by calcitriol in human endothelial cells inhibited Ang-II-induced leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions, morphogenesis, and production of endothelial proinflammatory and angiogenic chemokines through VDR-RXR interactions, and knockdown of VDR or RXR abolished the inhibitory effects of calcitriol.\nVDR activation reduces dissecting AAA formation induced by Ang-II in apoE(-\/-) mice and may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent AAA progression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b29","authors":["Martorell, Sara","Hueso, Luisa","Gonzalez-Navarro, Herminia","Collado, Aida","Sanz, Maria-Jesus","Piqueras, Laura","Sara Martorell","Luisa Hueso","Herminia Gonzalez-Navarro","Aida Collado","Maria-Jesus Sanz","Laura Piqueras"],"doi":"10.1161\/atvbaha.116.307530","first_seen_on":"2016-06-11T16:09:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1524-4636","1079-5642"],"issue":"8","journal":"Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (Highwire)","last_mentioned_on":1466186728,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27283745?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/atvb.ahajournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/09\/ATVBAHA.116.307530.abstract.html?ijkey=CXxzjYGWoNWRBbL&keytype=ref"],"pmid":"27283745","pubdate":"2016-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"ATVBAHA.116.307530","title":"Vitamin D Receptor Activation Reduces Angiotensin-II\u2013Induced Dissecting Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in Apolipoprotein E\u2013Knockout Mice","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-receptor-activation-reduces-angiotensiniiinduced-dissecting-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-apol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":4148214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2205762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268257,"mean":11.418896814982,"rank":145284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":96617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268257,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2343,"mean":4.6698676345004,"rank":1198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2343,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":3.9267605633803,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
