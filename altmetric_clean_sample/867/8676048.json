Several types of protein-protein interactions, both within and between PKS modules, play important roles in the catalytic cycle of a multimodular PKS. Additionally, vectorial biosynthesis is enabled by the energetic coupling of polyketide chain elongation to the channeling of intermediates between successive modules. A combination of high-resolution analysis of smaller PKS components and lower resolution characterization of intact modules and bimodules has yielded insights into the structure and organization of a prototypical assembly line PKS. This review discusses our understanding of key structure-function relationships in this family of megasynthases, along with a recap of key unanswered questions in the field.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026aa","authors":["Robbins, Thomas","Liu, Yu-Chen","Cane, David E","Khosla, Chaitan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.sbi.2016.05.009","endpage":"18","first_seen_on":"2016-06-11T22:34:36+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1879-033X","0959440X"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Structural Biology","last_mentioned_on":1465684458,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0959440X16300446"],"pmid":"27266330","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"10","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Structure and mechanism of assembly line polyketide synthases","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-mechanism-assembly-line-polyketide-synthases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7881477,"mean":6.674276674566,"rank":6824800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7881477,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267966,"mean":11.413862250667,"rank":223356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267966,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":713,"mean":2.7976882022472,"rank":655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":713,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.55,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
