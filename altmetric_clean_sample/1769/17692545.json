Despite an increasing interest in these systems, standardization in their fabrication process is still lacking but urgently required to support their use for real-life applications. In this work we investigate how the assembly of GO should be conducted to control adsorption geometry and optical properties at the interface with plasmonic nanostructures as monolayer assemblies of silver nanocubes, by tuning main experimental parameters including GO concentration and self-assembly time. We finally identified the experimental conditions for building up a close-fitting soft dressing of the plasmonic surface, which shows optimal characteristics for flexible and reliable SERS detection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Martina Banchelli","Bruno Tiribilli","Marella de Angelis","Roberto Pini","Gabriella Caminati","Paolo Matteini"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.5b10438","first_seen_on":"2017-03-17T20:55:16+00:00","issns":["1944-8244","1944-8252"],"issue":"4","journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1490030927,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsami.5b10438"],"pmid":"26751095","pubdate":"2016-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
