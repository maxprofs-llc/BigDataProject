However, no effective therapy is currently available for the treatment of this infection.\nWe identified small-molecule inhibitors of EV71 from a screen of 968 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, with which clinical application for EV71-associated diseases would be more feasible, using EV71 subgenomic replicon system. Primary hits were extensively evaluated for their antiviral activities in EV71-infected cells.\nWe identified micafungin, an echinocandin antifungal drug, as a novel inhibitor of EV71. Micafungin potently inhibits the proliferation of EV71 as well as the replication of EV71 replicon in cells with a low micromolar IC50 (~5\u00a0\u03bcM). The strong antiviral effect of micafungin on EV71 replicon and the result from time-of-addition experiment demonstrated a targeting of micafungin on virion-independent intracellular process(es) during EV71 infection. Moreover, an extensive analysis excluded the involvement of 2C and 3A proteins, IRES-dependent translation, and also that of polyprotein processing in the antiviral effect of micafungin.\nOur research revealed a new indication of micafungin as an effective inhibitor of EV71, which is the first case reporting antiviral activity of micafungin, an antifungal drug.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a9","authors":["Chonsaeng Kim","Hyunju Kang","Dong-eun Kim","Jae-Hyoung Song","Miri Choi","Mingu Kang","Kyungjin Lee","Hae Soo Kim","Jin Soo Shin","Hyejeong Jeong","Sunhee Jung","Sang-Bae Han","Jong Heon Kim","Hyun-Jeong Ko","Chong-Kyo Lee","Meehyein Kim","Sungchan Cho","Kim, Chonsaeng","Kang, Hyunju","Kim, Dong-Eun","Song, Jae-Hyoung","Choi, Miri","Kang, Mingu","Lee, Kyungjin","Kim, Hae Soo","Shin, Jin Soo","Jeong, Hyejeong","Jung, Sunhee","Han, Sang-Bae","Kim, Jong Heon","Ko, Hyun-Jeong","Lee, Chong-Kyo","Kim, Meehyein","Cho, Sungchan"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12985-016-0557-8","first_seen_on":"2016-06-13T20:47:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1743-422X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Virology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1466039528,"links":["http:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12985-016-0557-8?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27296985?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12985-016-0557-8?site=http:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4907259","pmid":"27296985","pubdate":"2016-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"1","title":"Antiviral activity of micafungin against enterovirus 71","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiviral-activity-micafungin-against-enterovirus-71"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7907411,"mean":6.6922707093667,"rank":3328383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4544594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7907411,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268022,"mean":11.461352371642,"rank":104515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":161410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268022,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1623,"mean":3.4470542540074,"rank":592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1623,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":2.5656603773585,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
