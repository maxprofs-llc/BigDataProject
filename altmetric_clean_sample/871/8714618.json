The cytotoxicity test demonstrated that IC50 value of atorvastatin to inhibit the growth and\/or viability of Flp-In-293\/ABCB1 (2677G) cells was 5.44\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10\u00a0mM, which was significantly lower than those in Flp-In-293\/ABCB1 (2677\u00a0T) (6.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u00a0mM) and Flp-In-293\/ABCB1 (2677A) cells (5.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u00a0mM).\nThese results indicate that ABCB1 rs2032582 may predict the risk of AILI in Japanese population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b8","authors":["Koya Fukunaga","Koya Fukunaga","Hiroshi Nakagawa","Toshihisa Ishikawa","Michiaki Kubo","Taisei Mushiroda"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12863-016-0390-5","first_seen_on":"2016-06-13T22:27:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2156"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1465856830,"links":["http:\/\/bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12863-016-0390-5?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12863-016-0390-5?site=http:\/\/bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4906899","pmid":"27296832","pubdate":"2016-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"ABCB1 polymorphism is associated with atorvastatin-induced liver injury in Japanese population","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abcb1-polymorphism-associated-atorvastatininduced-liver-injury-japanese-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7890722,"mean":6.6811441707233,"rank":6832593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7890722,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267818,"mean":11.457553030614,"rank":223361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267818,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":677,"mean":3.1254763313609,"rank":549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":677,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.2415348837209,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":4}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/whatDNAtest\/statuses\/742483477086404608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8714618],"posted_on":"2016-06-13T22:27:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Carlos Esteban PhD","url":"http:\/\/whatdnatest.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2209463838\/c-azul-negro2_normal.jpg","description":"News and comments on #genetics, #genomics, #RareDiseases and DNA testing.
