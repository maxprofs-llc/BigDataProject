During acute attacks patients exhibit a significant increase of NGF content compared to controls. In contrast during remission the mean NGF levels in CSF markedly decrease. These results strongly indicate that increased NGF production in CSF is a characteristic feature of the MS inflammatory response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ac","authors":["L B Laudiero","L Aloe","R Levi-Montalcini","C Buttinelli","D Schilter","S Gillessen","U Otten","Laudiero, L B","Aloe, L","Levi-Montalcini, R","Buttinelli, C","Schilter, D","Gillessen, S","Otten, U"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T03:04:48+00:00","issns":["0304-3940"],"issue":"1","journal":"Neuroscience Letters","last_mentioned_on":1422587042,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1480330"],"pmid":"1480330","pubdate":"1992-11-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Multiple sclerosis patients express increased levels of beta-nerve growth factor in cerebrospinal fluid.","type":"article","volume":"147","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-sclerosis-patients-express-increased-levels-betanerve-growth-factor-cerebrospinal-fluid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691566,"mean":5.7075477914095,"rank":3929845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691566,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163568,"mean":8.74326420366,"rank":131442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163568,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2157,"mean":2.8685705009276,"rank":1792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":1.516265060241,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1732016601\/posts\/10200167298541818","license":"public","citation_ids":[1501476,3164916,2014327,3164917,3164919,3164920,3164922],"posted_on":"2015-01-30T03:04:02+00:00","summary":"ELEVATED NERVE GROWTH FACTOR IN FIBROMYALGIA AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE \n\nIf you have fibromyalgia, it is likely you have seen one of the many recent articles concerning the following study that discovered fibromyalgia patients have excessive innervation of th","author":{"name":"Terry Salach","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1732016601","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1732016601\/picture","id_on_source":"1732016601"}}]}}
