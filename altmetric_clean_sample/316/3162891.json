The purpose of this study is to analyze the follow-up of PEG enteral feeding patients in the long term, and to report on the complication and survival rates. Between January 1991 and June 1995, we studied 136 patients (49% cancer and 51% non-cancer patients; male = 68%, female = 32%) after PEG insertion. One hundred twenty-eight patients had a long-term follow-up of over 31 d. The mean duration of PEG feeding was 277 +\/- 358 d (range 31-1590): 17% of patients returned to oral feeding, 34% continued enteral nutrition, and 49% died. Major complications occurred in 3% of the patients: 1 aspiration pneumonia, 1 subcutaneous abscess. 2 buried bumper syndrome. Minor complications arose in 14% of our cases: 8 tube blockages, 4 tube dislodgements, 6 site infections. For the whole group of 136 patients, survival probabilities after PEG insertion at 1, 6, 12, and 24 mo were 90.5%, 52%, 42%, and 35%, respectively. After 180 d, the difference in survival probabilities between cancer and non-cancer patients became significant (P < 0.02). Median survival probability was 64% for non-cancer and 39% for cancer patients, and this trend did not change over 2 y.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f610003215","doi":"10.1016\/s0899-9007(97)00030-0","first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T02:10:44+00:00","issns":["0899-9007"],"journal":"Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1337623140,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0899-9007(97)00030-0","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9263232"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nutritionjrnl.com\/article\/S0899900797000300\/pdf","pmid":"9263232","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: a long-term follow-up.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/percutaneous-endoscopic-gastrostomy-longterm-followup"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9310300946799,"rank":816064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2282668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93718,"mean":7.3387118741731,"rank":23979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93718,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":860,"mean":5.9321816065192,"rank":231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":860,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.6095238095238,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Dementia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=493694370#altmetric_citation_73","license":"public","citation_ids":[3162891],"posted_on":"2012-05-21T17:59:00+00:00","summary":"Dementia is a broad category of brain diseases that cause a long term and often gradual decrease in the ability to think and remember such that a person's daily functioning is affected.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=38390","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Dolfrog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Dolfrog"}}]}}
