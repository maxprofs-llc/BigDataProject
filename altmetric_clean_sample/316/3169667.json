The first step of T cell activation is triggered by the movement of one of their surface molecules, known as T cell receptor, into localized regions of cell membrane known as lipid rafts. Molecules called gangliosides are known to be major components of lipid rafts, but their role in T-cell activation remains to be elucidated. This review summarizes recent findings that different types of T cells require distinct ganglioside types for the activation. Control of ganglioside expression would offer a strategy targeting for specific T-cell subpopulations to treat immune diseases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Linking transcription to physiology in lipodomics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Inokuchi JI","Nagafuku M","Ohno I","Suzuki A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbalip.2014.07.013","first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T23:03:29+00:00","issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1422643054,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25193136?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25193136","pubdate":"2014-09-07T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Distinct selectivity of gangliosides required for CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T and CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell activation.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distinct-selectivity-gangliosides-required-cd4-t-cd8-t-cell-activation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691566,"mean":5.7075477914095,"rank":3929825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691566,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163572,"mean":8.7429855903556,"rank":131443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163572,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4418,"mean":2.6804935476568,"rank":3764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4418,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":2.106625,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
