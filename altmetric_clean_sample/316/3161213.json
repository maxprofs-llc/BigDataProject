Apart from the conventional causes for male infertility such as varicocoele, cryptorchidism, infections, obstructive lesions, cystic fibrosis, trauma, and tumours, a new and important cause has been identified: oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a result of the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants in the body. It is a powerful mechanism that can lead to sperm damage, deformity and eventually, male infertility. This review discusses the physiological need for ROS and their role in normal sperm function. It also highlights the mechanism of production and the pathophysiology of ROS in relation to the male reproductive system and enumerate the benefits of incorporating antioxidants in clinical and experimental settings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aad","authors":["Makker K","Agarwal A","Sharma R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T01:36:19+00:00","issns":["0971-5916"],"issue":"4","journal":"Indian Journal of Medical Research","last_mentioned_on":1484158600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19535829","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19535829"],"pmid":"19535829","pubdate":"2009-06-19T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Oxidative stress & male infertility.","type":"article","volume":"129","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxidative-stress-male-infertility-13"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":2024441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4922673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239870,"mean":8.1754864696981,"rank":68278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":165986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239870,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":696,"mean":3.6792834532374,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":696,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.0214285714286,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
