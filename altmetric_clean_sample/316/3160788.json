Male-mediated abnormalities have been reported after exposure to therapeutic and recreational drugs, to chemicals in the workplace and environment and to ionizing radiation. The impact on progeny outcome includes: an increase in congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, fetal resorptions; low birth weight; increase in childhood cancers; developmental, neurobehavioral, neuroendocrine, neurochemical abnormalities; effects in F2 generation progeny. Fertility is often unaffected. The comparative influence of genetic, epigenetic and nongenetic mechanisms in the etiology of paternally-mediated adverse outcomes is unknown. There is no a priori reason to assume that male-mediated effects are limited to the agents studied to date. The broad spectrum of alterations recorded after exposure to a variety of unrelated agents suggests the need for a more focused effort and multidisciplinary exploration of the potential impact of the male parent on reproductive outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e3","authors":["G Friedler"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T01:24:59+00:00","issns":["0091-3057"],"issue":"4","journal":"Pharmacology, Biochemistry & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1441057120,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8981601"],"pmid":"8981601","pubdate":"1996-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","behavioralsciences","pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Paternal exposures: impact on reproductive and developmental outcome.
