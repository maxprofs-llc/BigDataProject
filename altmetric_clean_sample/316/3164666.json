Fibroblasts were damaged by the generation of oxygen metabolites during the enzymatic oxidation of acetaldehyde by 50 munits of xanthine-oxidase (Xo). To quantify cell damage we measured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the culture medium and cell viability in fibroblast cultures. We found a significant increase in LDH activity in the FAD vs. controls and also in the AD vs. controls.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5973cf058f6100050b3","authors":["Tesco, G","Latorraca, S","Piersanti, P","Piacentini, S","Amaducci, L","Sorbi, S"],"doi":"10.1016\/0047-6374(92)90129-2","first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T02:56:11+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["00476374","0047-6374"],"issue":"2","journal":"Mechanisms of Ageing & Development","last_mentioned_on":1422581883,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/0047637492901292"],"pmid":"1365838","pubdate":"1992-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Alzheimer skin fibroblasts show increased susceptibility to free radicals ","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alzheimer-skin-fibroblasts-show-increased-susceptibility-free-radicals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691566,"mean":5.7075477914095,"rank":3929846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691566,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163568,"mean":8.7432657320857,"rank":131443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163568,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320,"mean":4.0226269592476,"rank":279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.0785714285714,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
