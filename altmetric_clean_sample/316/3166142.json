Previous researches had focused on environmental variables such as family history of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), behavior problems in the child with an ASD, parental mental health problems, stressful life events and \"broader autism phenotype\" (BAP), while variables like parenting style and family function that are shown to influence children's behavioral and psychosocial adjustment are overlooked. The aim of the present study was to reveal how parenting style and family function as well as BAP effect psychological adjustment of siblings of children with autism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef522a83ee09648b4a3e","authors":["Mohammadreza Mohammadi","Hadi Zarafshan"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T11:55:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1735-4587"],"issue":"2","journal":"Iranian Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1422625958,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25632281?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25632281?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmcid":"PMC4300466","pmid":"25632281","pubdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Family function, Parenting Style and Broader Autism Phenotype as Predicting Factors of Psychological Adjustment in Typically Developing Siblings of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/family-function-parenting-style-broader-autism-phenotype-predicting-factors-psychological-adjustment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":2118410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2589362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168289,"mean":8.5918161841607,"rank":68663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":96912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168289,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
