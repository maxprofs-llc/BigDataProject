This study demonstrates that papaverine, an isoquinoline alkaloid from the Papaveraceae, can overcome telomerase dependent immortality of HepG-2 cells that was used as a model of hepatocarcinoma. Although this alkaloid does not directly interact with telomeric sequences, papaverine inhibits telomerase through down-regulation of hTERT, which was analysed using thermal FRET and qRT-PCR, respectively. The IC50 values for the reduction of both telomerase activity and hTERT expression was 60 \u00b5M, while IC50 for cytotoxicity was 120 \u00b5M. Repeated treatments of the cells with very low non-toxic concentrations of papaverine resulted in growth arrest and strong reduction of population doublings after 40 days. This treatment induced senescent morphology in HepG-2 cells, which was evaluated by beta-galactosidase staining. Altogether, papaverine can be regarded as a promising model compound for drug design targeting cancer development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Sakineh Kazemi Noureini","Michael Wink"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules190811846","first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T12:29:08+00:00","issns":["1420-3049"],"journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1408256952,"links":["http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/264597511_Antiproliferative_Effect_of_the_Isoquinoline_Alkaloid_Papaverine_in_Hepatocarcinoma_HepG-2_Cells__Inhibition_of_Telomerase_and_Induction_of_Senescence"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Sakineh_Kazemi_Noureini\/publication\/264597511_Antiproliferative_Effect_of_the_Isoquinoline_Alkaloid_Papaverine_in_Hepatocarcinoma_HepG-2_Cells__Inhibition_of_Telomerase_and_Induction_of_Senescence\/links\/53e8e4310cf2dc24b3c7d400.pdf?ev=pub_ext_doc_dl_meta","pmid":"25111025","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Antiproliferative Effect of the Isoquinoline Alkaloid Papaverine in Hepatocarcinoma HepG-2 Cells \u2014 Inhibition of Telomerase and Induction of Senescence","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiproliferative-effect-isoquinoline-alkaloid-papaverine-hepatocarcinoma-hepg2-cells-inhibition-tel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6547726,"mean":6.068004118376,"rank":2398364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4119847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6547726,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207584,"mean":8.4221246055797,"rank":75485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":130613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207584,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2646,"mean":2.0504370510397,"rank":428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2646,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":2.1833720930233,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
