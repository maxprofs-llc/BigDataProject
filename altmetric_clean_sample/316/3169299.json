We assessed a new device, the CPR-Ezy (Medteq Innovations Pty Ltd., Brisbane, Australia), to aid timing and effectiveness of external cardiac compressions (ECC), by 32 subjects who had prior community-based training in CPR. ECC was performed on a manikin for 4 min by all subjects without and with the device. There was a statistically significant improvement in timing of ECC. Effectiveness of compressions was also improved over the whole time period, especially so in the last minute. We conclude that the CPR-Ezy can improve timing and effectiveness of ECC, and reduce the effects of resuscitator fatigue, in community-trained subjects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003476","authors":["Andrew J.
