Members of the Bacillus genus are considered as the factories for the production of biologically active molecules that are potential inhibitors of growth of phytopathogens. Plant diseases constitute an emerging threat to global food security. Many of the currently available antimicrobial agents for agriculture are highly toxic and nonbiodegradable and thus cause extended environmental pollution. Moreover, an increasing number of phytopathogens have developed resistance to antimicrobial agents. The lipopeptides have been tried as potent versatile weapons to deal with a variety of phytopathogens. All the three families of Bacillus lipopeptides, namely, Surfactins, Iturins and Fengycins, have been explored for their antagonistic activities towards a wide range of phytopathogens including bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes. Iturin and Fengycin have antifungal activities, while Surfactin has broad range of potent antibacterial activities and this has also been used as larvicidal agent. Interestingly, lipopeptides being the molecules of biological origin are environmentally acceptable.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Khem Raj Meena","Shamsher S Kanwar"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/473050","first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T11:03:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6141"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1422615757,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25632392?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25632392","title":"Lipopeptides as the Antifungal and Antibacterial Agents: Applications in Food Safety and Therapeutics.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lipopeptides-antifungal-antibacterial-agents-applications-food-safety-therapeutics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":3982646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168290,"mean":8.5918108848471,"rank":135237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168290,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.1636363636364,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
