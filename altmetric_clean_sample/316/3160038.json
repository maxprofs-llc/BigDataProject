An immunorecessive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope in influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP), residues 218 to 226, was identified when mice were immunized with a plasmid DNA encoding a full-length mutant NP in which the anchor residues for the immunodominant NP147-155 epitope were altered. Mice immunized with wild-type or mutant NP DNA were protected from lethal cross-strain virus challenge, and the protection could be adoptively transferred by immune splenocytes, indicating the role of cell-mediated immunity in the protection. DNA immunization is capable of eliciting protective cellular immunity against both immunodominant and immunorecessive CTL epitopes in the hierarchy seen with virus infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["T M Fu","A Friedman","J B Ulmer","M A Liu","J J Donnelly"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T01:03:59+00:00","issns":["1098-5514","0022-538X"],"journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1213640447,"links":["http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9060624","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9060624","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC191393"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/71\/4\/2715.full.pdf","pmid":"9060624","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Protective cellular immunity: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses against dominant and recessive epitopes of influenza virus nucleoprotein induced by DNA immunization.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protective-cellular-immunity-cytotoxic-tlymphocyte-responses-against-dominant-recessive-epitopes-inf-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630679,"mean":4.9289340563991,"rank":816174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630679,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95126,"mean":8.0736029014457,"rank":24795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95126,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4381,"mean":3.0024735159817,"rank":618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4381,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":2.9350961538462,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
