Prevention and risk reduction are important and the identification of specific biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC represents an active field of research. Increasing evidence indicates that fat accumulation in the liver, defined as hepatosteatosis, is an independent and strong risk factor for developing an HCC. MacroH2A1, a histone protein generally associated with the repressed regions of chromosomes, is involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and is present in two alternative spliced isoforms, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2. These isoforms have been shown to predict lung and colon cancer recurrence but to our knowledge, their role in fatty-liver associated HCC has not been investigated previously.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Francesca Rappa","Azzura Greco","Christine Podrini","Francesco Cappello","Michelangelo Foti","Lucie Bourgoin","Marion Peyrou","Arianna Marino","Nunzia Scibetta","Roger Williams","Gianluigi Mazzoccoli","Massimo Federici","Valerio Pazienza","Manlio Vinciguerra"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0054458","first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T01:25:16+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1441057120,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3553099\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0054458","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23372727","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3553099"],"pmid":"23372727","pubdate":"2015-01-30T20:13:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Immunopositivity for Histone MacroH2A1 Isoforms Marks Steatosis-Associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunopositivity-histone-macroh2a1-isoforms-marks-steatosisassociated-hepatocellular-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4799377,"mean":3.0665934878747e+18,"rank":3767355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":696927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4799377,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163959,"mean":3.0578899885072e+18,"rank":133525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":26019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163959,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83040,"mean":2.9330588249005e+18,"rank":66192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":14147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83040,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1795,"mean":2.9116083374302e+18,"rank":1457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1795,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
