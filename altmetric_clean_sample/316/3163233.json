We postulate that this is done in REM sleep by a reverse learning mechanism (see also p. 158), so that the trace in the brain of the unconscious dream is weakened, rather than strengthened, by the dream.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["F Crick","G Mitchison","Crick, F","Mitchison, G"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-30T02:18:29+00:00","issns":["0028-0836"],"issue":"5922","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1485817326,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6866101","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6866101"],"pmid":"6866101","pubdate":"2015-05-22T21:49:47+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"The function of dream sleep.","type":"article","volume":"304","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/function-dream-sleep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154803,"mean":6.8922645386048,"rank":1981713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6134357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154803,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240628,"mean":8.1874915283821,"rank":65629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":173703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240628,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47468,"mean":73.743006636189,"rank":33157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":14076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47468,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":809,"mean":177.0337970297,"rank":749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":809,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":12,"Associate Professor":3,"Assistant Professor":7,"Post Doc":12,"Ph.D. Student":47,"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)":15,"Researcher (at a non-Academic Institution)":2,"Other Professional":10,"Student (Postgraduate)":12,"Student (Master)":22,"Student (Bachelor)":34,"Senior Lecturer":1,"Lecturer":5,"Doctoral Student":6},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":70,"Humanities":1,"Arts and Literature":1,"Social Sciences":2,"Psychology":49,"Mathematics":3,"Physics":5,"Design":1,"Medicine":23,"Engineering":3,"Chemistry":1,"Electrical and Electronic Engineering":3,"Education":3,"Computer and Information Science":15,"Linguistics":3,"Philosophy":5}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":9,"EC":1,"UY":1,"IE":1,"IT":2,"GB":5,"IN":1,"FR":2,"CA":2,"PL":1,"NL":4,"DE":2,"JP":1,"CN":1,"SE":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Rapid eye movement sleep","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=220153068#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[1300391,3163233],"posted_on":"2017-01-30T23:02:06+00:00","summary":"8=D.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=167184","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Danielw0731","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Danielw0731"}},{"title":"Reverse learning","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=215478437#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[1300391,3163233],"posted_on":"2008-05-28T11:25:44+00:00","summary":"Reverse learning is a neurobiological theory of dreams.
