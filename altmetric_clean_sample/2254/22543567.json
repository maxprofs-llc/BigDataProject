The present study investigates the mechanism through which seed priming and foliar spraying with PAs protect wheat plants from drought stress. 10 days old wheat seedlings were exposed to drought stress by withholding water alone or with 100\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0PAs solutions (putrescine, Put; spermine, Spm; and mixture of Put and Spm for 10\u00a0h seed-priming or three foliar sprays during withholding water. Drought stress impaired the wheat growth and altered the osmoprotectants, endogenous PAs levels, PAs biosynthetic genes expression and weight of 1000 grains compared to the corresponding control values. Exogenously applied PAs improved cell water status, accumulated osmoprotectants and PAs and up-regulated PAs biosynthetic genes, ADC, arginine decarboxylase; DHS, deoxyhypusine synthase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase and SAMDC, S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase. Put significantly regulate the endogenous PAs by both methods of application, however, Spm and mixture of Put and Spm could positively regulate the endogenous PAs and the biosynthetic gene expression by foliar spraying rather than seed priming. The data provide evidence that maintenance of water economy through stabilized cellular structure is an important strategy of drought tolerance by PAs in wheat.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333c","authors":["Ebeed, Heba Talat","Hassan, Nemat Mohamed","Aljarani, Alshafei Mohammed"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.plaphy.2017.07.014","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T19:56:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0981-9428","1873-2690"],"journal":"Plant Physiology & Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1501065396,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28743037?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28743037","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Soil Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany","biochemistry"],"title":"Exogenous applications of Polyamines modulate drought responses in wheat through osmolytes accumulation, increasing free polyamine levels and regulation of polyamine biosynthetic genes","type":"article","volume":"118","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exogenous-applications-polyamines-modulate-drought-responses-wheat-through-osmolytes-accumulation-in"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":7157792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170885,"mean":11.564949076567,"rank":139494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170885,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":729,"mean":0.95834615384615,"rank":406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":729,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.1403225806452,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Ph.
