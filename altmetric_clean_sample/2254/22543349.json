Deregulation of the WNT\/\u03b2-catenin pathway is a key event in CRC initiation. This pathway interacts with other nuclear signaling pathways, including members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and their transcription coregulators. In this review, we provide an overview of the literature dealing with the main coactivators (NCoA-1 to 3, NCoA-6, PGC1-\u03b1, p300, CREBBP and MED1) and corepressors (N-CoR1 and 2, NRIP1 and MTA1) of nuclear receptors and summarize their links with the WNT\/\u03b2-catenin signaling cascade, their expression in CRC and their role in intestinal physiopathology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Triki, Mouna","Lapierre, Marion","Cavailles, Vincent","Mokdad-Gargouri, Raja"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.v23.i25.4480","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T19:55:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1007-9327","2219-2840"],"issue":"25","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1501065214,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28740336?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5504363","pmid":"28740336","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Expression and role of nuclear receptor coregulators in colorectal cancer","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-role-nuclear-receptor-coregulators-colorectal-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":7157792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170886,"mean":11.564884910905,"rank":139494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170886,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3684,"mean":3.2775769752919,"rank":2556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3684,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":5.856,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WntPublications\/statuses\/890158145040900097","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22543349],"posted_on":"2017-07-26T10:33:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Wnt publications","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/867065609405833216\/3jto4N3b_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot on Wnt signaling pathway publications #Wnt #PubMed","id_on_source":"WntPublications","tweeter_id":"866558175335649280","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":28},"tweet_id":"890158145040900097"}]}}
