During their biogenesis the apo-forms of Fe\/S proteins expose unprotected Fe\/S cluster-coordinating cysteine side chains rendering them vulnerable to oxidative modifications that interfere with subsequent Fe\/S cluster insertion. Whether and how cells protect these delicate cysteine residues is unknown.\nHere we show that sulfhydryl groups of Fe\/S cluster-coordinating cysteine residues of mitochondrial Fe\/S apo-proteins acquire cyclic S-polythiol modifications. These adducts are the result of a persulfide addition followed by a subsequent oxidation step. These modifications accumulate upon defects in the early stages of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly (ISC) system, but are also found in wild type cells under normal growth conditions. They are, however, not found on Fe\/S apo-proteins in the cytosol. Innovation and conclusion: Our work describes a novel in vivo chemical modification of cysteine side chains in mitochondrial Fe\/S apo-proteins. These cyclic S-polythiolation adducts are resistant to oxidation yet can be removed by reductive cleavage, suggesting that they serve as a reversible protection device for cysteine ligands sensitive to oxidative modification.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022ba","authors":["ChristStefan","LeichertLars I.","WillmsAnna","LillRoland","M\u00fchlenhoffUlrich"],"doi":"10.1089\/ars.2015.6599","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T20:00:37+00:00","issns":["1523-0864","1557-7716"],"journal":"Antioxidants & Redox Signaling","last_mentioned_on":1501011720,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/ars.2015.6599"],"pmid":"26975213","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Defects in Mitochondrial Iron\u2013Sulfur Cluster Assembly Induce Cysteine S-Polythiolation on Iron\u2013Sulfur Apoproteins","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/defects-mitochondrial-ironsulfur-cluster-assembly-induce-cysteine-spolythiolation-ironsulfur-apoprot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":5.08,"3m":5.08,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272105,"mean":6.9807941447478,"rank":1591760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6659798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272105,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168876,"mean":11.531196672095,"rank":40285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":127981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168876,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":828,"mean":3.3444836759371,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":828,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.96052631578947,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
