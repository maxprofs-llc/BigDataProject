In conducting a preliminary investigation, we hypothesized that there is no serologic evidence of CHIKV infection among attendees of selected hospitals in Lagos and Osun States, Nigeria. Sera from 304 consecutively selected participants were screened for CHIKV IgG and IgM using ELISA. Findings were analyzed vis-\u00e0-vis participants' demographic and clinical data. Over 90.0% of the participants had never heard of CHIKV despite the fact that a large proportion of them (88.8%) had secondary\/tertiary education. Overall, 41.8% were positive for, at least, one antibody type (IgG or IgM), while about 16.0% of the participants had dual seropositivity (CHIKV IgG and IgM) with gender as associated factor (odds ratio [OR]: 2.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Prevalence rates were 31.8% and 38.4% for CHIKV IgG and IgM, respectively. Only hospital location (Osogbo) was associated with CHIKV IgG (OR: 2.2, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), while gender alone was associated with CHIKV IgM (OR: 3.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Participants seropositive for CHIKV antibodies were mostly adults (18-59\u00a0yrs) belonging to the active work-force; five (22.7%) and three (20.0%) of the pregnant participants had CHIKV IgG and IgM, respectively. Detection of CHIKV IgM in some participants might make them potentially infectious to the newborn and mosquito vectors. Importantly, participants positive for either IgG or IgM had fever (72.8%, 67.2%) and general body pains (61.7%, 57.6%), respectively. This ELISA-based study revealed serologic evidence of CHIKV infection among hospital attendees in Lagos and Osun states with the group-specific prevalence rates being considerably high.\nChikungunya virus (CHIKV); Chikungunya (CHIK); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); immunoglobulin G or M (IgG\/IgM); odds ratio (OR); non-structural proteins (nsP); hemagglutination inhibiting (HI); complement fixing (CF); neutralization test (NT); immunofluorescence assay (IFA); plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT); confidence interval (CI); analysis of variance (ANOVA); body temperature (BT); Building Nigeria's Response to Climate Change (BNRCC).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003d7a","authors":["Olajiga, Olayinka M.","Adesoye, Olajumoke E.","Emilolorun, Adewale P.","Adeyemi, Abiodun J.","Adeyefa, Emmanuel O.","Aderibigbe, Ismail A.","Adejumo, Salmot A.","Adebimpe, Wasiu O.","Opaleye, Oluyinka O.","Sule, Waidi F.","Oluwayelu, Daniel O."],"doi":"10.1080\/08820139.2017.1319383","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T19:45:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0882-0139","1532-4311"],"journal":"Immunological Investigations","last_mentioned_on":1501081141,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28742401?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28742401","pubdate":"2017-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Chikungunya Virus Seroprevalence and Associated Factors among Hospital Attendees in Two States of Southwest Nigeria: A Preliminary Assessment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chikungunya-virus-seroprevalence-associated-factors-among-hospital-attendees-two-states-southwest-ni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":6279611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1119532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170888,"mean":11.564720885731,"rank":120303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170888,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":1.6610440251572,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.4375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiteOfAMosquito\/statuses\/890224946428784640","license":"gnip","rt":["ArboNews"],"citation_ids":[22541138],"posted_on":"2017-07-26T14:59:01+00:00","author":{"name":"EWU Disease Ecology","url":"https:\/\/sites.ewu.edu\/diseaseecology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1296108286\/1c9cf72c-fd56-4ea1-a6bc-e8f71044369d_normal.png","description":"Eastern Washington University Disease Ecology Lab.
