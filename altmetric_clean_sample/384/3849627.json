The object of the study was to validate the clinical usefulness of serum Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone (AMH) and the current marker inhibin B as single and combined markers of AGCTs. We conducted a longitudinal, partially prospective cohort study of 123 pre- and postmenopausal AGCT patients with a median follow-up time of 10.5 years (range 0.3-50.0 years). Serum AMH and inhibin B levels were measured from 560 pretreatment and follow-up serum samples by using immunoenzymometric assays. We found that serum AMH and inhibin B levels were significantly elevated in patients with primary or recurrent AGCTs. The levels of both markers positively correlated to tumor size (p<0.05). AMH and inhibin B performed similarly in Receiving operator characteristic analyses; Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were 0.92 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.88-0.95) for AMH, and 0.94 (95%CI 0.90-0.96) for inhibin B. AMH was highly sensitive (92%) and specific (81%) in detecting a macroscopic AGCT. However, in AUC comparison analyses, the combination of the markers was superior to inhibin B alone. In conclusion, serum AMH is a sensitive and specific marker of AGCT, and either AMH or inhibin B can be monitored during follow-up. However, combining AMH and Inhibin B in AGCT patient follow-up improves the detection of recurrent disease. This article is protected by copyright.
