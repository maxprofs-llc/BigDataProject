However, little is known about the specific enzymes involved and cleavage steps they catalyze. Here we report the functional characterization of the single Arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding a putative YbeY endoribonuclease (AtYbeY). AtYbeY null mutants are seedling-lethal, indicating that AtYbeY function is essential for plant growth. Knock-down plants display slow growth and show pale-green leaves. Physiological and ultrastructural analyses of ybeY mutants revealed impaired photosynthesis and defective chloroplast development. Fluorescent microcopy analysis showed that, when fused with the green fluorescence protein, AtYbeY is localized in chloroplasts. Immunoblot and RNA gel blot assays revealed that the levels of chloroplast-encoded subunits of photosynthetic complexes are reduced in atybeY mutants, but the corresponding transcripts accumulate normally. In addition, atybeY mutants display defective maturation of both the 5' and 3' ends of 16S, 23S, and 4.5S rRNAs as well as decreased accumulation of mature transcripts from the tRNA genes contained in the chloroplast rRNA operon. Consequently, mutant plants show a severe deficiency in ribosome biogenesis which in turn results in impaired plastid translational activity. Furthermore, biochemical assays show that recombinant AtYbeY is able to cleave chloroplast rRNAs as well as mRNAs and tRNAs in vitro. Taken together, our findings indicate that AtYbeY is a chloroplast-localized endoribonuclease that is required for chloroplast rRNA processing and thus for normal growth and development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Jinwen Liu","Wenbin Zhou","Guifeng Liu","Chuanping Yang","Yi Sun","Wenjuan Wu","Shenquan Cao","Chong Wang","Guanghui Hai","Zhifeng Wang","Ralph Bock","Jirong Huang","Yuxiang Cheng","Liu J","Zhou W","Liu G","Yang C","Sun Y","Wu W","Cao S","Wang C","Hai G","Wang Z","Bock R","Huang J","Cheng Y"],"doi":"10.1104\/pp.114.255000","first_seen_on":"2015-03-28T19:29:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2548","0032-0889"],"issue":"1","journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1460721548,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25810095?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.plantphysiol.org\/content\/168\/1\/205.abstract"],"pmid":"25810095","pubdate":"2015-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"The Conserved Endoribonuclease YbeY Is Required for Chloroplast Ribosomal RNA Processing in Arabidopsis","type":"article","volume":"168","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conserved-endoribonuclease-ybey-required-chloroplast-ribosomal-rna-processing-arabidopsis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":2952356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4547276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198342,"mean":9.2055090172986,"rank":69951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":126440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198342,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635,"mean":3.8521265822785,"rank":1594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":4.1279111111111,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
