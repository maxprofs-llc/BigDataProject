Although this phenomenon was previously accepted as a postinflammatory reaction, recent observations suggest psoriasis-related cytokines and their efficient supression by biologic agents strongly associate with melanogenesis and melanocytic proliferation. Hereby, we report a patient who developed multiple lentigines arising in resolved psoriatic plaques induced by infliximab and review similar cases reported in the literature induced after biologic treatments of psoriasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000650d","authors":["Sibel Dogan","Nilg\u00fcn Atakan"],"doi":"10.3109\/15569527.2014.959664","first_seen_on":"2015-03-26T14:39:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1556-9535"],"journal":"Cutaneous & Ocular Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1427380754,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25806714?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25806714","pubdate":"2015-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["dermatology","ophthalmology"],"title":"Multiple lentigines confined to psoriatic plaques induced by biologic agents in psoriasis therapy: a case and review of the literature.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-lentigines-confined-psoriatic-plaques-induced-biologic-agents-psoriasis-therapy-case-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4925544,"mean":5.8484905160748,"rank":4119656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4925544,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145899,"mean":10.354362801409,"rank":122009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145899,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205,"mean":1.1362254901961,"rank":189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"TR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/581103119720910848","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3841226],"posted_on":"2015-03-26T14:39:14+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
