The purpose of this study was to determine potential toxicity of a stabilized aloe vera gel derived from the inner gel fillet and marketed as a drink. The gel juice was assessed through assays of genotoxicity in vivo and acute and subchronic toxicity in B6C3F1 mice. Aloe vera did not increase the SOS DNA repair response in Escherichia coli and at 1\u00d7 and 0.25\u00d7 it did not increase mutagenesis of Salmonella TA100 resulting in histidine biosynthesis. At 3 and 14days following acute exposure, male and female mice gavaged with the stabilized aloe gel had daily appearances, total body weight gain, selected organ weights, necropsy and hematology tests similar to control mice gavaged with water. After a 13-week aloe gel feed study, male and female mice evaluated by the same criteria as the acute study plus feed consumption and serum chemistry tests were found to be equivalent to control groups. These data indicate that a commercial stabilized aloe gel consumed as a beverage was not genotoxic or toxic in vivo. These results contrast with those obtained using preparations containing aloe latex phenolic compounds such as anthraquinones.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f2","authors":["Sehgal I","Winters WD","Scott M","Kousoulas K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fct.2013.01.012","first_seen_on":"2015-03-28T14:45:31+00:00","issns":["02786915","0278-6915"],"journal":"Food & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1460988930,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0278691513000343","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23376510"],"pmid":"23376510","pubdate":"2013-05-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"An in vitro and in vivo toxicologic evaluation of a stabilized aloe vera gel supplement drink in mice ","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-vivo-toxicologic-evaluation-stabilized-aloe-vera-gel-supplement-drink-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":24.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":24.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":304823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7259994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198408,"mean":9.2104912125077,"rank":12830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":185550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198408,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2032,"mean":7.2108980797637,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":1955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2032,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.2625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
