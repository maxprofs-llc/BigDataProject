A repeated DTM (every sixth session and dose adjustment accordingly) was compared to an age-based method (ABM) regarding treatment characteristics, clinical outcome, and cognitive functioning after ECT. Thirty-nine unipolar depressed patients dosed using repeated DTM and 40 matched patients treated with ABM were compared. Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were assessed at baseline and at the end of the index course, as well as the total number of ECT sessions. Both groups were similar regarding age, sex, psychotic features, mean baseline MADRS, and median baseline MMSE. At the end of the index course, the two methods showed equal outcome (mean end MADRS, 11.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3 in DTM and 9.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.6 in ABM (P\u00a0=\u00a00.26); median end MMSE, 28 (25-29) and 28 (25-29.8), respectively (P\u00a0=\u00a00.81). However, the median number of all ECT sessions differed 16 (11-22) in DTM versus 12 (10-14.8) in ABM; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02]. Using regression analysis, dosing method and age were independently associated with the total number of ECT sessions, with less sessions needed in ABM (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and in older patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In this comparative cohort study, ABM and DTM showed equal outcome for depression and cognition. However, the median ECT course duration in repeated DTM appeared longer. Additionally, higher age was associated with shorter ECT courses regardless of the dosing method. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002815","authors":["Jan Jaap Aten","Mardien Oudega","Eric van Exel","Max L Stek","Jeroen A van Waarde"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00406-015-0591-3","first_seen_on":"2015-03-26T10:20:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1433-8491"],"journal":"European Archives of Psychiatry & Clinical Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1427365215,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25804765?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25804765","pubdate":"2015-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Repeated dose titration versus age-based method in electroconvulsive therapy: a pilot study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/repeated-dose-titration-versus-agebased-method-electroconvulsive-therapy-pilot-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4925544,"mean":5.8485273635848,"rank":2613775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1646752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4925544,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145898,"mean":10.354683646682,"rank":84099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":46068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145898,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":413,"mean":3.0891359223301,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":413,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.8730769230769,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
