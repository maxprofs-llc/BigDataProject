Growing evidence suggests a strong link between circadian rhythms and energy metabolism; however, the fundamental mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, neonatal streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice were used to model the molecular and physiological progress from insulin resistance to diabetes. Two-day-old male C57BL\/6 mice received a single injection of STZ and were tested for non-obese, hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic conditions in the early stage, insulin resistance in the middle stage, and diabetes in the late stage. Gene expression levels of the hepatic circadian-clock system were examined by real-time quantitative PCR. Most of the components of the hepatic circadian-clock gene expression system, such as the mRNAs of Bmal1 (brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1), Per2 (period 2) and Cry1 (cryptochrome 1), were elevated, and circadian patterns were retained in the early and middle stages of insulin-resistant conditions. The insulin sensitizer, rosiglitazone, returns the physiological and molecular changes associated with the diabetic phenotype to normal levels through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) rather than PPAR\u03b1. Early and chronic treatment with rosiglitazone has been shown to be effective to counter the diabetic condition. Over time, this effect acts to attenuate the increased gene expression levels of the hepatic circadian-clock system and delay the severity of diabetic conditions. Together, these results support an essential role for the hepatic circadian-clock system in the coordinated regulation and\/or response of metabolic pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Tseng HL","Yang SC","Yang SH","Shieh KR"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0120380","first_seen_on":"2015-03-28T14:28:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1443526552,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25799429","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0120380"],"pmid":"25799429","pubdate":"2015-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Hepatic Circadian-Clock System Altered by Insulin Resistance, Diabetes and Insulin Sensitizer in Mice","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatic-circadianclock-system-altered-insulin-resistance-diabetes-insulin-sensitizer-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6417267,"mean":5.8794758110387,"rank":3025885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1923146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6417267,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160967,"mean":10.279766696072,"rank":92105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":52220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160967,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97729,"mean":9.7093253110675,"rank":56128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":31097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97729,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4696,"mean":9.4662624068158,"rank":2931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4696,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
