Since then, thousands of structures have been determined to resolutions ranging from 30 \u00c5 to near atomic (<4 \u00c5). Almost overnight, the recent development of direct electron detectors and the attendant improvement in analysis software have advanced the technology considerably. Near-atomic-resolution reconstructions can now be obtained, not only for megadalton macromolecular complexes or highly symmetrical assemblies but also for proteins of only a few hundred kilodaltons. We discuss the developments that led to this breakthrough in high-resolution structure determination by cryo-EM and point to challenges that lie ahead. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Biochemistry Volume 84 is June 02, 2015.
