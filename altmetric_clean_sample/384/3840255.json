Recently, 1 family involving 2 patients with a homozygous mutation in ADAM17 were described, presenting with skin lesions and diarrhea. In this report, we describe a second family confirming the existence of this syndrome. The proband presented with severe diarrhea, skin rash, and recurrent sepsis, eventually leading to her death at the age of 10 months. We performed exome sequencing and detailed pathological and immunological investigations. We identified a novel homozygous frameshift mutation in ADAM17 (NM_003183.4:c.308dupA) leading to a premature stop codon. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell stimulation assays showed severely diminished tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-2 production. Skin biopsies indicated a focal neutrophilic infiltrate and spongiotic dermatitis. Interestingly, the patient developed unexplained systolic hypertension and nonspecific hepatitis with apoptosis. This report provides evidence for an important role of ADAM17 in human immunological response and underscores its multiorgan involvement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007680","authors":["Robert H J Bandsma","Harry van Goor","Michael Yourshaw","Rudolf K Horlings","Marcel F Jonkman","Elisabeth H Sch\u00f6lvinck","Arend Karrenbeld","Rene Scheenstra","Martin K\u00f6mhoff","Patrick Rump","Yvonne Koopman-Keemink","Stanley F Nelson","Johanna C Escher","Ernest Cutz","Mart\u00edn G Mart\u00edn","Bandsma RH","van Goor H","Yourshaw M","Horlings RK","Jonkman MF","Sch\u00f6lvinck EH","Karrenbeld A","Scheenstra R","K\u00f6mhoff M","Rump P","Koopman-Keemink Y","Nelson SF","Escher JC","Cutz E","Mart\u00edn MG","Robert H.J.
