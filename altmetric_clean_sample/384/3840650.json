Male C57BL\/6 mice were infected with the bacteria by intragastric inoculation (1\u00d710(9) CFU\/mouse) 3 times at 2-day intervals, and simultaneously, orally treated twice a day with total 20, 64 or 200 mg\/kg\/day FEMY-R7 for 2 weeks. In Campylobcter-like organism (CLO)-detection tests on gastric mucosa and feces, FEMY-R7 reduced the urease-positive reactivity in a dose-dependent manner; i.e., the positivity ratios were decreased to 70, 20, and 10% for gastric mocosa and to 80, 50, and 20% for feces. In a clinical sudy, human subjects, confirmed to be infected with Helicobacter pylori, were orally administered twice a day with capsules containing total 100, 320 or 1,000 mg\/man\/day FEMY-R7 (matching doses for 20, 64 or 200 mg\/kg\/day, respectively, in mice from a body surface area-based dose translation) for 8 weeks. FEMY-R7 decreased the positivity ratios in feces to 70, 40, and 30%, respectively. In bacterial culture, H. pylori was identified from the CLO-positive stools of mice and humans. The bacterial identification ratios exhibited a good correlation between the matching doses in mice and humans. It is suggested that FEMY-R7 could be a promising functional food without tolerance as an adjunct to reduce the dosage of antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent H. pylori infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc64","authors":["Tae-Su Kim","Kyungha Shin","Joseph H Jeon","Ehn-Kyoung Choi","Youngjin Choi","Sung-Pyo Lee","Yoon-Bok Lee","Yun-Bae Kim"],"doi":"10.5625\/lar.2015.31.1.7","first_seen_on":"2015-03-26T11:43:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1738-6055"],"issue":"1","journal":"Laboratory Animal Research","last_mentioned_on":1427370125,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25806078?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25806078","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Comparative analysis of anti-Helicobacter pylori activities of FEMY-R7 composed of Laminaria japonica and Oenothera biennis extracts in mice and humans.","type":"article","volume":"31"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4925450,"mean":5.8487171667015,"rank":4119682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4925450,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145901,"mean":10.354912131597,"rank":122015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145901,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.6689655172414,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TumorImm_papers\/status\/581058536471302144","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3840650],"posted_on":"2015-03-26T11:42:05+00:00","author":{"name":"TumorImmunoPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/741322452093931520\/rQvFtFTA_normal.jpg","description":"A TwitterBot for Cancer Immunology and Tolerance papers on #PubMed.
