An e-survey was designed and developed based on the results of a scoping search of journal articles, previously validated questionnaires and relevant related surveys; discussions of draft versions of the e-survey and method with lead representatives of stakeholder organisations; and a pilot study with seven prospective respondents. The e-survey and subsequent reminder to employment advisors were distributed internally by the government employment advisory agency. The e-survey was completed by 78\/156 (50%) advisors, the majority of whom (74%) received a request for advice in the last year from at least one CS. Most CS used the employment service less than one year (52%) or one year or more after treatment (32%). Fatigue was the most commonly reported barrier to returning to work (10%) and staying in work (14%); and a supportive employer was the top facilitating factor in returning to (21%), and continuing in (27%), employment. Although most advisors had a positive attitude about a CS's capacity to return-to-work, half were uncertain about how best to advise cancer survivors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100014b6","authors":["Emma R.
