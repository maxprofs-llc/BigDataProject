However, empirical evidence of this possibility is limited. The present cross-sectional study compared the relationships of 24\u00a0h urine-derived and self-reported intakes of Na, K and protein with obesity. A total of 1043 Japanese women aged 18-22 years completed a 24\u00a0h urine collection and a self-administered diet history questionnaire. After adjustment for potential confounders, 24\u00a0h urine-derived Na intake was associated with a higher risk of general obesity (BMI \u2265\u00a025\u00a0kg\/m2) and abdominal obesity (waist circumference \u2265\u00a080\u00a0cm; both P for trend\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b704). For 24\u00a0h urine-derived protein intake, positive associations with general and abdominal obesity were observed (P for trend\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b702 and 0\u00b7053, respectively). For 24\u00a0h urine-derived K intake, there was an inverse association with abdominal obesity (P for trend\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b701). Conversely, when self-reported dietary information was used, only inverse associations between K intake and general and abdominal obesity were observed (P for trend\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b704 and 0\u00b702, respectively), with no associations of Na or protein intake. In conclusion, we found positive associations of Na and protein intakes and inverse associations of K intake with obesity when using 24\u00a0h urinary excretion for estimating dietary intakes. However, no association was observed based on using self-reported dietary intakes, except for inverse association of K intake, suggesting that the ability of self-reported dietary information using the diet history questionnaire for investigating diet-obesity relationships is limited.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000579a","authors":["Kentaro\u00a0Murakami","M.
