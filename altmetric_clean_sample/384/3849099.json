To mitigate the tolerability concerns of high GSK239512 exposures resulting from CYP3A inhibition, a 2-cohort adaptive design was used to facilitate a stepwise selection of dose levels and subject numbers. In Cohort 1, 6 subjects received a single dose of 20\u2009\u03bcg GSK239512 alone and then 10\u2009\u03bcg GSK239512 in combination with repeated once daily doses of 400\u2009mg ketoconazole. The results from Cohort 1 demonstrated an approximately 1.5-fold increase in GSK239512 exposure with a good tolerability profile. This led to the adoption of a 3-session option in Cohort 2, in which 16 subjects received sequential single doses of 20\u2009\u03bcg GSK239512 alone, 40\u2009\u03bcg GSK239512 alone, and a single dose of 40\u2009\u03bcg GSK239512 in combination with repeated once daily doses of 400\u2009mg ketoconazole. The 2-cohort adaptive design proved effective in mitigating any potentially significant DDI risk to healthy subjects. Final results showed a 1.3-fold increase in GSK239512 exposure with ketoconazole, suggesting that in vivo metabolism of GSK239512 by CYP3A is unlikely to be the primary route of GSK239512 elimination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d05","authors":["Xu, Jianfeng","Hilpert, Jan","Wu, Kai","van Hecke, Benjamin","Collins, Gary","Patel, Aarti","Mohindra, Rajat","Davies, Matt J.
