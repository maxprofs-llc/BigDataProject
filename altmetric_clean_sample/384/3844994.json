The development of undecalcified bone techniques and of the bulk staining technique has established a method for demonstrating the existence of intravital cracks and enhanced the discrimination towards artifactual microfissures in the load-bearing skeleton. Recently the presence of intravital microfissures has also been ascertained in temporal bones by these techniques. Due to the fluorescent properties of basic fuchsin it is possible to use epifluorescence microscopy for analysis of microfissures after bulk staining with basic fuchsin. This provides a more steady microscopic background and a sharper delineation of surface level structures since no projection from lower levels interfere. Artifactual cracks, which in transmitted light microscopy may look like darkly stained intravital microfissures due to refraction phenomena, become invisible or colorless. Epifluorescence microscopy enhances the detection of both smaller and larger prestained intravital microfissures, and leaves only a minor part of the cracks without certain categorization. The epifluorescence mode of analysis has the further advantage of being independent of slice thickness, making feasible whole-specimen analysis by serial stepwise grinding. The present study shows that the number and the length of microfissures in the human otic capsule, counted and measured under the epifluorescence microscope, equals numerically the findings in light microscopy, enabling the routine use of this mode of analysis. This may prove to be of particular value in the research into the etiology and pathogenesis of otosclerosis as well as perilymphatic fistulae.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9213cf058f61000d88f","authors":["T Frisch","M S S\u00f8rensen","P Bretlau"],"doi":"10.1007\/s004050000286","first_seen_on":"2015-03-28T17:42:26+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0937-4477"],"issue":"2","journal":"Archiv f\u00fcr klinische und experimentelle Ohren Nasen und Kehlkopfheilkunde","last_mentioned_on":1427480620,"links":["http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/12026198_Recognition_of_basic_fuchsin_prestained_microfissures_of_intravital_origin_with_fluorescence_microscopy_validation_of_a_shortcut"],"pmid":"11307606","pubdate":"2001-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Otorhinolaryngology","scheme":"springer"}],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Recognition of basic fuchsin prestained microfissures of intravital origin with fluorescence microscopy: validation of a shortcut.","type":"article","volume":"258","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recognition-basic-fuchsin-prestained-microfissures-intravital-origin-fluorescence-microscopy-validat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4927808,"mean":5.8496558347391,"rank":2614886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1647823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4927808,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146537,"mean":10.292961593056,"rank":84535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":46271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146537,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AeshaMiller\/status\/581521985336938496","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3844994],"posted_on":"2015-03-27T18:23:40+00:00","author":{"name":"A'esha Miller","url":"http:\/\/therighttobefree.wordpress.com\/","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/525469872436686848\/rfq77uS3_normal.jpeg","description":"Always go lightly","id_on_source":"AeshaMiller","tweeter_id":"19005968","geo":{"_id":"On The Round Table"},"followers":675},"tweet_id":"581521985336938496"}]}}
