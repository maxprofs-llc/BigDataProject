A survey was carried out with 1375 people who received FAMACHA(\u00a9) training from July 2009 to May 2011 in Paran\u00e1 State, Brazil. The survey was conducted from March 2012 to May 2013. Firstly, a questionnaire was applied with specific questions for farmers about their anthelmintic (AH) treatment practices before and after the FAMACHA(\u00a9) training. In a second step, eight of the questionnaire respondents classified as sheep or goat farmers were contacted for an in loco visit during which the application of the FAMACHA(\u00a9) system was evaluated in the respective farms and blood samples were collected from 20 animals to calculate sensitivity and specificity. A total of 124 farmers responded the questionnaire (9% of project participants). Farmers accounted for 48.4% of total responses. Half of these farmers (51.6%) reported losses related to parasites in their property before the training. Antiparasitic treatments, at fixed intervals, were responsible for 93.1% of deworming practices before the training project. FAMACHA(\u00a9) was unknown for 51.7% of the respondents, and 31% knew the chart, but did not use it. After the project, 69% had adopted the system and 83% assessed the animals at regular intervals. However, 18.9% did not evaluate all animals. During the in loco visits, problems reported included the incorrect exposure of the ocular mucosa (50% of farmers) and not using the chart (87.5%). Also, 62.5% did not keep records of the FAMACHA(\u00a9) assessment history of the flock. However, sensitivity was 100%, with 0% false negatives. We conclude that, amongst farmers who adopted the system, despite some methodological errors regarding its use, the objectives were met in terms of reducing the number of anthelmintic treatments and providing anemic animals with AH treatment. Trained farmers seemed to require technical guidance post-training to promote effective use of the FAMACHA(\u00a9) system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fd","authors":["Dh\u00e9ri Maia","Fernanda Rosalinski-Moraes","Juan Felipe de Torres-Acosta","Maria Christine Rizzon Cintra","Cristina Santos Sotomaior"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vetpar.2015.02.033","first_seen_on":"2015-03-26T12:27:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2550"],"journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1427372854,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25805324?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25805324","pubdate":"2015-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"FAMACHA(\u00a9) system assessment by previously trained sheep and goat farmers in Brazil.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/famacha-system-assessment-previously-trained-sheep-goat-farmers-brazil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4925544,"mean":5.8485273635848,"rank":4119672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4925544,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145897,"mean":10.354763187476,"rank":122015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145897,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1341,"mean":1.8818537313433,"rank":1015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1341,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.5016129032258,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
