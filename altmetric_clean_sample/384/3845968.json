Consequently, quenching QS modulates the environmental impact of P.aeruginosa. To identify bacteria capable of inactivating the QS signal molecule 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (PQS), a minimal medium containing PQS as the sole carbon source was used to enrich a Malaysian rainforest soil sample. This yielded an Achromobacter xylosoxidans strain (Q19) which inactivated PQS yielding a new fluorescent compound (I-PQS) confirmed as PQS-derived using deuterated-PQS. The I-PQS structure was elucidated using MS and NMR as 2-heptyl-2-hydroxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline-3,4-dione (HHQD). A.\u2009xylosoxidans Q19 oxidized PQS congeners with alkyl chains ranging from C1 to C5 and also N-methyl PQS yielding the corresponding 2-hydroxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline-3,4-diones, but was unable to inactivate the PQS precursor HHQ. This indicates that the hydroxyl group at position 3 in PQS is essential and that A.xylosoxidans inactivates PQS via a pathway involving the incorporation of oxygen at C2 of the heterocyclic ring. The conversion of PQS to HHQD also occurred on incubation with 12\/17 A.xylosoxidans strains recovered from cystic fibrosis patients, with P.aeruginosa and with Arthrobacter, suggesting that formation of hydroxylated PQS may be a common mechanism of inactivation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ea","authors":["Eliza Ye-Chen Soh","Siri Ram Chhabra","Nigel Halliday","Stephan Heeb","Christine M\u00fcller","Franziska S Birmes","Susanne Fetzner","Miguel C\u00e1mara","Kok-Gan Chan","Paul Williams","Soh, Eliza Ye\u2010Chen","Chhabra, Siri R.","Halliday, Nigel","Heeb, Stephan","M\u00fcller, Christine","Birmes, Franziska S.","Fetzner, Susanne","C\u00e1mara, Miguel","Chan, Kok\u2010Gan","Williams, Paul"],"doi":"10.1111\/1462-2920.12857","endpage":"4365","first_seen_on":"2015-03-28T19:15:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1462-2920","1462-2912"],"issue":"11","journal":"Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1448521066,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25809238?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25809238\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/1462-2920.12857","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1462-2920.12857\/abstract?campaign=woletoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1462-2920.12857\/pdf","pmid":"25809238","pubdate":"2015-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"4352","subjects":["environmentalhealth","microbiology"],"title":"Biotic inactivation of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa quinolone signal molecule","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biotic-inactivation-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-quinolone-signal-molecule"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059538,"mean":6.8397725663364,"rank":3182508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4851108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059538,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201125,"mean":9.396735695392,"rank":69228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":130701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201125,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1896,"mean":6.0276042216359,"rank":967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1896,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":4.6469846153846,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
