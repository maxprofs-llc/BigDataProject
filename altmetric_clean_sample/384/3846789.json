Previous studies suggest that GABA agonists lead to an attenuation of emotion-processing related BOLD signals in the insula. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between GABA concentration and fear-related BOLD responses in this region. In 44 female participants with different levels of fearfulness, GABA concentration in the left insula was measured using a GABA+ MRS acquisition during rest; additionally, BOLD signals were obtained during performance of a fear provocation paradigm. Fearfulness was not associated with GABA+ in the left insula, but could predict fear-related BOLD responses in a cluster in the left anterior insula. The BOLD signal change in this cluster did not correlate with GABA+ concentration. However, we found a significant positive correlation between GABA+ concentration and fear-related BOLD responses in a different cluster that included parts of the left insula, amygdala and putamen. Our findings indicate that low insular GABA concentration is not a predisposition for fearfulness, and that several factors influence whether a correlation between GABA and BOLD can be found.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ilona Lipp","C John Evans","Caroline Lewis","Kevin Murphy","Richard G Wise","Xavier Caseras"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0120101","first_seen_on":"2015-03-28T20:21:49+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1427650835,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25811453?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0120101#pone.0120101.ref020","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0120101"],"pmid":"25811453","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Relationship between Fearfulness, GABA+, and Fear-Related BOLD Responses in the Insula.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-fearfulness-gaba-fearrelated-bold-responses-insula"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4932132,"mean":5.8538413359275,"rank":2272393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2535207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4932132,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146589,"mean":10.295829358474,"rank":70906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":70739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146589,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87039,"mean":9.1869737815667,"rank":40813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":42752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87039,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4423,"mean":9.4583107191316,"rank":2317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4423,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
