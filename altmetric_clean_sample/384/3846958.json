Rate enhancements on the order of up to three times compared to the bleaching of rhodopsin alone where observed. Fluorescence measurements and other data suggests that the porphyrins act as photosensitizers and excite the visual pigment via electron or triplet state energy transfer. These mechanisms suggest that rhodopsin possesses a pocket, proximal to the Schiff base so that porphyrins act as photosensitizers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Washington I","Brooks C","Turro NJ","Nakanishi K"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja0486317","first_seen_on":"2015-03-28T20:32:36+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"32","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1427448196,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15303842"],"pmid":"15303842","pubdate":"2004-08-12T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Porphyrins as photosensitizers to enhance night vision.","type":"article","volume":"126","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/porphyrins-photosensitizers-enhance-night-vision"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8402655,"mean":7.0746547086116,"rank":6376830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1140212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8402655,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203117,"mean":9.4744643651904,"rank":143071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":31914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203117,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19300,"mean":5.3118987512306,"rank":15844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19300,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284,"mean":6.4123109540636,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
