Amphiphilic peptide EAK16-II co-assembled with its histidinylated analogue EAKIIH6 into beta-sheet fibrils. When adaptor complexes (recombinant protein A\/G molecules loaded with both anti-His and anti-EpCAM IgGs) were added to the mix, TECs were tethered to the hydrogel and formed 3-D mini clusters. TECs bound to the hydrogel composites retained their molecular properties; and when transplanted into athymic nude mice, they supported the development of functional T-cells. These mini thymic units of TECs can be useful in clinical applications to reconstitute T-cell adaptive immunity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255c","authors":["Asako Tajima","Wen Liu","Isha Pradhan","Suzanne Bertera","Christina Bagia","Massimo Trucco","Wilson S Meng","Yong Fan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clim.2015.03.010","first_seen_on":"2015-03-26T10:27:34+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1521-7035"],"journal":"Clinical Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1450876053,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25805654?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25805654","pubdate":"2015-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Bioengineering mini functional thymic units with EAK16-II\/EAKIIH6 self-assembling hydrogel.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioengineering-mini-functional-thymic-units-eak16iieakiih6-selfassembling-hydrogel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6818838,"mean":6.1901666501164,"rank":4821665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1751615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6818838,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193799,"mean":9.1601643051013,"rank":122978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":59101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193799,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":568,"mean":2.2415767195767,"rank":340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":568,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.941652173913,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
