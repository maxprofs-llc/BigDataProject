A case-cohort design was carried out that included incident cases of cancers of the larynx, oesophagus, and stomach, and a 10% sample of the cohort. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate MWF exposure effects. The smoothing method of penalised splines was used to explore the shape of the underlying exposure-response curves.\nThe most important finding was the association between larynx cancer incidence and cumulative straight MWF exposure. The results for oesophageal cancer were less consistent. For stomach cancer there was no evidence of excess risk.\nThis association between larynx cancer and straight MWF exposures was consistent with a previous finding in this cohort, providing further support for a causal relation.","altmetric_jid":"52b2ceaa3cf058a06b8b4568","authors":["Zeka, A","Eisen, E A","Kriebel, D","Gore, R","Wegman, D H","A Zeka","E A Eisen","D Kriebel","R Gore","D H Wegman"],"doi":"10.1136\/oem.2003.010157","endpage":"431","first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T19:46:34+00:00","issns":["1470-7926","1351-0711"],"issue":"5","journal":"Occupational and environmental medicine","last_mentioned_on":1136073600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/oem.2003.010157"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/oem.bmj.com\/content\/61\/5\/426.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1740767","pmid":"15090663","pubdate":"2004-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"426","subjects":["environmentalhealth","occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers in a case-cohort study of autoworkers exposed to metalworking fluids","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/oem.bmj.com\/cgi\/doi\/10.1136\/oem.2003.010157","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-upper-aerodigestive-tract-cancers-casecohort-study-autoworkers-exposed-metalworking-fluids-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7240318,"mean":6.3633072336439,"rank":1721978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4599569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7240318,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263447,"mean":11.323476401236,"rank":84427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":175810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263447,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1860,"mean":8.6387907477138,"rank":542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1860,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":68.246153846154,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
