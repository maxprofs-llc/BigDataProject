Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) protects the host against symptomatic infections with more virulent strains. To mimic this protective effect, we deliberately establish ABU in UTI-prone patients, who are refractory to conventional therapy. The patients are inoculated with Escherichia coli (E. coli) 83972, now widely used as a prototype ABU strain. Therapeutic efficacy has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial, supporting the feasibility of using E. coli 83972 as a tool to prevent recurrent UTI and, potentially, to outcompete antibiotic-resistant strains from the human urinary tract. In addition, the human inoculation protocol offers unique opportunities to study host-parasite interaction in vivo in the human urinary tract. Here, we review the clinical evidence for protection using this approach as well as some molecular insights into the pathogenesis of UTI that have been gained during these studies.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f1a","authors":["Wullt, Bj\u00f6rn","Svanborg, Catharina","Bj\u00f6rn Wullt"],"doi":"10.3390\/pathogens5030052","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T18:00:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2076-0817"],"issue":"3","journal":"Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1471442597,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27483325?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27483325?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27483325\/","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-0817\/5\/3\/52","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-0817\/5\/3\/52\/htm"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-0817\/5\/3\/52\/pdf","pmid":"27483325","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","startpage":"52","title":"Deliberate Establishment of Asymptomatic Bacteriuria\u2014A Novel Strategy to Prevent Recurrent UTI","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deliberate-establishment-asymptomatic-bacteriuriaa-novel-strategy-prevent-recurrent-uti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":1910037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6303575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258224,"mean":12.015052857414,"rank":75818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":181609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258224,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":2.9766395348837,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.6184,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
