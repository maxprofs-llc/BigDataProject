In this review, we describe the most recent findings on T-cell subset responses and regulation in sarcoidosis. We discuss how future immunological research can advance the field to unravel pathobiological mechanisms of this intriguingly complex disease.\nResearch into the field of T-cell plasticity has recently challenged the long-held T helper type 1 (Th1) paradigm in sarcoidosis and striking parallels with autoimmune disorders and common variable immunodeficiency were recognized. For instance, it was demonstrated that Th17.1-cells rather than Th1-cells are responsible for the exaggerated IFN-\u03b3 production in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Furthermore, impaired regulatory T-cell function and alterations within the expression of co-inhibitory receptors that control T-cell responses, such as PD-1, CTLA-4 and BTNL2, raise new questions regarding T-cell regulation in pulmonary sarcoidosis.\nIt becomes increasingly clear that Th17(.1)-cells and regulatory T-cells are key players in sarcoidosis T-cell immunology. New findings on plasticity and co-inhibitory receptor expression by these subsets help build a more comprehensive model for T-cell regulation in sarcoidosis and will finally shed light on the potential of new treatment modalities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000586c","authors":["Broos, Caroline E.","Hendriks, Rudi W.","Kool, Mirjam"],"doi":"10.1097\/mcp.0000000000000303","endpage":"483","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T21:14:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1531-6971","1070-5287"],"issue":"5","journal":"Current opinion in pulmonary medicine","last_mentioned_on":1470258864,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-pulmonarymedicine\/Abstract\/2016\/09000\/T_cell_immunology_in_sarcoidosis___Disruption_of_a.14.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-pulmonarymedicine\/2016\/09000\/T_cell_immunology_in_sarcoidosis___Disruption_of_a.14.pdf","pmid":"27379969","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"476","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"T-cell immunology in sarcoidosis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-pulmonarymedicine\/Fulltext\/2016\/09000\/T_cell_immunology_in_sarcoidosis___Disruption_of_a.14.aspx","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tcell-immunology-sarcoidosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":6197793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1097954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257660,"mean":11.99812480837,"rank":182831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":40023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257660,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":549,"mean":2.6343065693431,"rank":380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":549,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.4274285714286,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CO_Pulmonary_Md\/statuses\/760946946215251970","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10253093],"posted_on":"2016-08-03T21:14:24+00:00","author":{"name":"CO Pulmonary Med","url":"http:\/\/www.co-pulmonarymedicine.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1706276488\/MCP_square_cover_normal.jpg","description":"Provides powerful perspectives on the most important advances in published literature, delivering expert assessments of developments from the previous year.","id_on_source":"CO_Pulmonary_Md","tweeter_id":"368365405","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":252},"tweet_id":"760946946215251970"}]}}
