CNS infiltration occurs in one third of patients, but cognitive changes are common in patients without CNS disease. Here we investigate whether there is a neuroanatomic basis to observed cognitive deficits, even in absence of CNS disease.\nWe present a volumetric analysis of eleven ECD patients without CNS tumors or prior neurotoxic treatments.\nCompared to age-matched controls, ECD patients have diffuse, bihemispheric reduction in cortical thickness and subcortical gray matter.\nThese findings provide the first corroborating evidence for neurologic disease in ECD patients without direct CNS infiltration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000087f","authors":["Eli L.
