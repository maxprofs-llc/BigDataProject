Twenty-four children diagnosed with autism from Kowloon, Hong Kong were assessed for spatial orientation and spatial management abilities. Positive changes in spatial orientation were evident when the children wore ambient prism lenses and included changes in posture from slanted to erect. Adjustments in spatial management were evident in improved ball catching ability, a task requiring visual tracking and eye-hand coordination. The findings suggest that alterations to the sensory systems may lead to behavioral change in some children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002506","authors":["Dennis P.
