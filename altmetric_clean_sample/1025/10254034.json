In RAW 264.7 cells expressing an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-directed luciferase gene, heat-inactivated V0151 stimulated iNOS expression followed by nitric oxide production. V0151 significantly elevated interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-10, tumour necrosis factor alpha, and IL-1\u03b2 production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In splenocytes isolated from ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitised BALB\/c mice treated with OVA and V0151 at different bacterium-to-cell ratios (1:1, 10:1, and 20:1) for 96 h, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 production was dose-dependently downregulated, whereas IL-12 was dose-dependently upregulated. Collectively, our findings indicate that V0151 might regulate pro-inflammatory factors in macrophages and splenocytes. Furthermore, the T helper 1\/T helper 2 (Th1\/Th2) balance was also skewed toward Th1 dominance through the elevation of Th1 cytokine production.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8163cf058f61000bb85","authors":["Liu, Y W","Fu, T Y","Peng, W S","Chen, Y H","Cao, Y M","Chen, C C","Hung, W L","Tsai, Y C"],"doi":"10.3920\/bm2014.0159","endpage":"705","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T22:54:25+00:00","issns":["1876-2891","1876-2883"],"issue":"5","journal":"Beneficial Microbes","last_mentioned_on":1470264847,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26192907?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26192907","pubdate":"2015-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"697","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"\n              Evaluation of the potential anti-allergic effects of heat-inactivated\n              Lactobacillus paracasei\n              V0151\n              in vitro\n              ,\n              ex vivo\n              , and\n              in vivo\n            ","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-potential-antiallergic-effects-heatinactivated-ilactobacillus-paracaseii-v0151-iin-vitroi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":7063024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257661,"mean":11.998033028021,"rank":217632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257661,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227,"mean":7.8936991150442,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":8.566,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/760972041776357380","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10254034],"posted_on":"2016-08-03T22:54:07+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
