The FETs are fabricated based on monolayer MoS2 with a piezoelectric GaN nanowire (NW) as the local gate, and a self-aligned process is employed to define the source\/drain electrodes. The fabrication method allows the preservation of the intrinsic property of MoS2 and suppresses the scattering center density in the MoS2\/GaN interface, which results in high electrical and photoelectric performances. MoS2 FETs with channel lengths of \u223c200 nm have been fabricated with a small subthreshold slope of 64 mV\/dec. The photoresponsivity is 443.3 A\u00b7W(-1), with a fast response and recovery time of \u223c5 ms under 550 nm light illumination. When strain is introduced into the GaN NW, the photoresponsivity is further enhanced to 734.5 A\u00b7W(-1) and maintains consistent response and recovery time, which is comparable with that of the mechanical exfoliation of MoS2 transistors. The approach presented here opens an avenue to high-performance top-gated piezo-enhanced MoS2 photodetectors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Xingqiang Liu"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.6b01839","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T17:57:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-086X","1936-0851"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1470299886,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsnano.6b01839"],"pmid":"27447946","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"\n              Enhancing Photoresponsivity of Self-Aligned MoS\n              2\n              Field-Effect Transistors by Piezo-Phototronic Effect from GaN Nanowires\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhancing-photoresponsivity-selfaligned-mos2-fieldeffect-transistors-piezophototronic-effect-gan-nan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":3730847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4354245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257719,"mean":11.998910359385,"rank":112715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":140410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257719,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4979,"mean":11.955572117316,"rank":2910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4979,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":13.306650246305,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
