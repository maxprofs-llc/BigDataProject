Communication between plants and microorganisms via SPMEs contained in root exudates or derived from litter decomposition is an example of this phenomenon. In this review, the general aspects of rhizodeposition together with the significance of terpenes and phenolic compounds are discussed in detail. We focus specifically on the effect of SPMEs on microbial community structure and metabolic activity in environments contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Furthermore, a section is devoted to a complex effect of plants and\/or their metabolites contained in litter on bioremediation of contaminated sites. New insights are introduced from a study evaluating the effects of SPMEs derived during decomposition of grapefruit peel, lemon peel, and pears on bacterial communities and their ability to degrade PCBs in a long-term contaminated soil. The presented review supports the \"secondary compound hypothesis\" and demonstrates the potential of SPMEs for increasing the effectiveness of bioremediation processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Musilova, Lucie","Ridl, Jakub","Polivkova, Marketa","Macek, Tomas","Uhlik, Ondrej","Lucie Musilova","Jakub Ridl","Marketa Polivkova","Tomas Macek","Ondrej Uhlik"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms17081205","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T18:20:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"8","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1475774881,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27483244?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/8\/1205\/htm","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/8\/1205?utm_content=buffer3edf9&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/ijms17081205"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/8\/1205\/pdf","pmid":"27483244","pubdate":"2016-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1205","title":"Effects of Secondary Plant Metabolites on Microbial Populations: Changes in Community Structure and Metabolic Activity in Contaminated Environments","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-secondary-plant-metabolites-microbial-populations-changes-community-structure-metabolic-acti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.83,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.83},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8188485,"mean":6.9240464725765,"rank":1100638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7085669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8188485,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257891,"mean":12.006265702431,"rank":48485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":209032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257891,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5228,"mean":2.3899445188445,"rank":318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5228,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":372,"mean":2.2317681940701,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":372,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
