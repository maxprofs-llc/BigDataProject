The a priori definition of acceptability for a given resource was an average Likert scale score of six or greater. Two well-validated self-report measures assessed hoarding symptom severity: the Saving Inventory-Revised and the Clutter Image Rating Scale.\nTwo hundred and seventy two participants who self-reported having hoarding behaviors completed the questionnaire. Analyses focused on the 73% of responders (n=203) who reported clinically significant hoarding behaviors (i.e., Saving Inventory-Revised scores of \u226540). The three most acceptable treatments were individual cognitive behavioral therapy (6.2 \u00b13.1 on the Likert scale), professional organizing service (6.1 \u00b13.2), and use of a self-help book (6.0 \u00b13.0).\nIn this sample of individuals with self-reported clinically significant hoarding behaviors (n=203), only 3 out of 11 treatments and services for hoarding were deemed acceptable using an a priori score. While needing replication, these findings indicate the need to design more acceptable treatments and services to engage clients and maximize treatment outcomes for hoarding disorder.","altmetric_jid":"5216115e3cf058827c000026","authors":["Carolyn I.
