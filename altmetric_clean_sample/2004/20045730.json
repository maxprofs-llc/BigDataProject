Full-length analyses of the genes were performed using next-generation sequencing. Based on the gene sequences, we constructed the time-scale evolutionary trees by Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Time-scale phylogenies showed that the RdRp and VP1 genes evolved uniquely and independently. Four genotypes of GII.2 (major types: GII.P2-GII.2 and GII.P16-GII.2) were detected. A common ancestor of the GII.2 VP1 gene existed until about 1956. The evolutionary rates of the genes were high (over 10(-3) substitutions\/site\/year). Moreover, the VP1 gene evolution may depend on the RdRp gene. Based on these results, we hypothesized that transfer of the RdRp gene accelerated the VP1 gene evolution of HuNoV genotype GII.2. Consequently, recombination between ORF1 (polymerase) and ORF2 (capsid) might promote changes of GII.2 antigenicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["Kazuhiko Katayama","Hirokazu Kimura","Fuminori Mizukoshi","Koo Nagasawa","Yen H.
