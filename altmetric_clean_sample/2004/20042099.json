This article outlines the potential role of each stakeholder (patient, provider, policymaker and payer) throughout the CER process and provides examples of practical questions that researchers can ask the four primary stakeholder groups at each step of the CER process. This guide aims to assist in the development of meaningful stakeholder-researcher shared decision-making to incorporate stakeholder views in the design, conduct and dissemination of patient-centered CER.","altmetric_jid":"5587ebc22a83ee287f8b4570","authors":["Yoon Duk Hong","Daisuke Goto","C Daniel Mullins"],"doi":"10.2217\/cer-2016-0082","first_seen_on":"2017-05-11T14:00:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2042-6305","2042-6313"],"journal":"Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research","last_mentioned_on":1494511205,"links":["http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2217\/cer-2016-0082"],"pmid":"28485177","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Future Medicine Ltd London, UK ","title":"Querying stakeholders to inform comparative effectiveness research","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/querying-stakeholders-inform-comparative-effectiveness-research"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":6216354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1102001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237813,"mean":12.389883025247,"rank":168336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237813,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254,"mean":3.0836442687747,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.5204,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
