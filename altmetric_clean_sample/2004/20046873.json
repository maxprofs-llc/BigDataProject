An integrated acclimation-granulation process was devised, with Mordant Orange 1 as the model pollutant. Performance tests were carried out in a batch column reactor to evaluate the effect of various operating parameters. The optimal condition was to use 1.0-1.7 mm (1.51\u00b10.33mm) granules, 5 g\/L biomass, and 4000 mg\/L organics as nutrient; and supplement the wastewater with 1 mg\/L dissolved oxygen. This led to a dye mineralization of 61 \u00b1 2%, an anaerobic dye removal of 88 \u00b1 1%, and an aerobic aromatic amines removal of 70 \u00b1 3% within 48 hours. This study showed that simultaneous anaerobic\/aerobic process by aerobic granules could be a possible alternative to the conventional activated sludge process.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f61000114d","authors":["Lawrence K.Q.
