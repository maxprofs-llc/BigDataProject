However, there are no evidence-based studies on the skin-care effects of E. japonica leaves. To explore new biological activities of E. japonica leaves against skin disorder and to gain a better understanding of the chemical components associated with bioactivities, we evaluated 18 triterpenoids from E. japonica leaves on anti-melanogenesis, anti-acne, anti-allergy and anti-aging activities. Our results revealed that eight compounds showed anti-melanogenesis activity, of which ursolic acid (1) and maslinic acid (7) were the most potent with the similar selective index to that of arbutin. Structure-activity relationship and possible mechanism of active compounds were proposed. Twelve compounds exhibited anti-acne effect; ursolic acid (1), maslinic acid (7), corosolic acid (8) and euscaphic acid (12) showed highest activities against P. acnes. Four compounds displayed anti-allergy and anti-inflammatory activity; 3-epicorosolic acid (9) and euscaphic acid (12) showed marked activity against \u03b2-hexosaminidase release. Finally, ursolic acid (1), pomolic acid (10), colosolic acid (8) and its methylated derivative (6) exhibited the highest anti-aging activity by stimulating collagen and hyaluronic acid (HA) production. Our findings provide valuable evidence that E. japonica leaves have potential applications as ingredients of function foods or cosmetics for health benefits and a number of triterpenoids may play an important role in these bioactivities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Hui Tan","Tamrakar Sonam","Kuniyoshi Shimizu"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms18051030","first_seen_on":"2017-05-11T14:16:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"5","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1494512144,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/5\/1030?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/ijms18051030"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/5\/1030\/pdf","pmid":"28492484","pubdate":"2017-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"The Potential of Triterpenoids from Loquat Leaves (Eriobotrya japonica) for Prevention and Treatment of Skin Disorder","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-triterpenoids-loquat-leaves-eriobotrya-japonica-prevention-treatment-skin-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":7085774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237813,"mean":12.389880922745,"rank":193426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237813,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5228,"mean":2.3899502582743,"rank":3852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5228,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":519,"mean":1.7416795366795,"rank":335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":519,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
