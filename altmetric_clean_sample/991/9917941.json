Frailty is described by a clinically significant state where a patient is at risk for developing complications requiring increased assistance in daily activities. Frailty syndrome studied in geriatric patients is responsible for an increased risk for falls, and increased mortality. In efforts to prepare for and to intervene in perioperative complications and general frailty, a universal scale to measure frailty is necessary. Many methods for determining frailty have been developed, yet there remains a need to define clinical frailty and, therefore, the most effective way to measure it. This article reviews six popular scales for measuring frailty and evaluates their clinical effectiveness demonstrated in previous studies. By identifying the most time-efficient, criteria comprehensive, and clinically effective scale, a universal scale can be implemented into standard of care and reduce complications from frailty in both non-surgical and surgical settings, especially applied to the perioperative surgical home model. We suggest further evaluation of the Edmonton Frailty Scale for inclusion in patient care.","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b4570","authors":["Stoicea, Nicoleta","Baddigam, Ramya","Wajahn, Jennifer","Sipes, Angela C.","Arias-Morales, Carlos E.","Gastaldo, Nicholas","Bergese, Sergio D."],"doi":"10.3389\/fpubh.2016.00150","first_seen_on":"2016-07-21T05:57:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2296-2565"],"journal":"Frontiers in Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1469080631,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpubh.2016.00150\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpubh.2016.00150\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4954808","pmid":"27493935","pubdate":"2016-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"The Gap Between Clinical Research and Standard of Care: A Review of Frailty Assessment Scales in Perioperative Surgical Settings","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gap-between-clinical-research-standard-care-review-frailty-assessment-scales-perioperative-surgical"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088508,"mean":6.8823654995833,"rank":6142966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1085625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088508,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258114,"mean":11.985582244985,"rank":182806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258114,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1012,"mean":7.8658615232443,"rank":632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1012,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":13.891567567568,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
