Here, we investigated the role of PFN1 mutations in the formation of prion-like abnormal TDP-43. Expression of PFN1 with pathogenic mutations resulted in the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates positive for p62 and ubiquitin, and these aggregates sequestered endogenous TDP-43. TDP-43 accumulation was facilitated in the presence of proteasome or lysosome inhibitor. Co-expression of mutant PFN1 and TDP-43 increased the levels of detergent-insoluble and phosphorylated TDP-43, and this increase required the C-terminal region of TDP-43. Moreover, detergent-insoluble fractions prepared from cells expressing ALS-linked mutant PFN1 induced seed-dependent accumulation of TDP-43. These findings indicate that expression of PFN1 mutants induces accumulation of TDP-43, and promotes conversion of normal TDP-43 into an abnormal form. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms of TDP-43 proteinopathies and other diseases associated with amyloid-like protein deposition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100085cb","authors":["Tanaka, Yoshinori","Hasegawa, Masato","Yoshinori Tanaka"],"doi":"10.1080\/19336896.2016.1207033","endpage":"00","first_seen_on":"2016-07-21T02:52:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1933-690X","1933-6896"],"issue":"4","journal":"Prion","last_mentioned_on":1473267945,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27432186?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27432186","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/19336896.2016.1207033?hootPostID=5b1641decc611853caf04d7a7fa41e4d"],"pmid":"27432186","pubdate":"2016-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"00","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Profilin 1 mutants form aggregates that induce accumulation of prion-like TDP-43","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/profilin-1-mutants-form-aggregates-induce-accumulation-prionlike-tdp43"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":813576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7521819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260593,"mean":12.037693919997,"rank":37106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":223070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260593,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266,"mean":3.0453433962264,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.9375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
