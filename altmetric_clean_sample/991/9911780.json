The peptide moiety is composed of two or three repeats of l-Ala-d-Val units while the PEG has a molecular weight of 2kDa. The self-assembling properties of the two conjugates depend significantly on the length of the peptide. Nanoparticles with different sizes and morphologies are formed, the structural properties of which are compared with the previously studied l-Ala-d-Val octapeptide conjugate that self-assembles into rod-like nanoparticles. The aggregation properties were studied by NMR, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopies and dynamic light scattering. The morphology and size of the nanoparticles were assessed by scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The loading and release of a model drug were also investigated. This study demonstrates that, by changing the length of the peptide, it is possible to modulate the self-assembly and loading properties of peptide-PEG conjugates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031b5","authors":["Novelli, Federica","De Santis, Serena","Punzi, Pasqualina","Giordano, Cesare","Scipioni, Anita","Masci, Giancarlo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nbt.2016.07.005","first_seen_on":"2016-07-20T20:40:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-4347","18716784"],"journal":"New Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1469047194,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27432196?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27432196","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Self-assembly and drug release study of linear l,d-oligopeptide-poly(ethylene glycol) conjugates","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfassembly-drug-release-study-linear-ldoligopeptidepolyethylene-glycol-conjugates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085102,"mean":6.8782317593723,"rank":6140394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1085049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085102,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257816,"mean":11.979346663305,"rank":182628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257816,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":344,"mean":2.5928571428571,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":344,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.0430769230769,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
