The Pb(2+) ion acted as the metal center of the coordination complex, which formed N-Pb(2+)-O coordination bonds with the MTT-AgNPs, shortening the interparticle distance, and inducing aggregation of the MTT-AgNPs. This aggregation resulted in a dramatic color change from yellow to dark blue. Using this methodology, the concentration of Pb(2+) ions in environmental samples could be quantitatively detected with the naked eye or by using UV-vis spectrometry. Also, we found that the selectivity and sensitivity of detection were noticeably improved in the pH range of 7-8, at which a more obvious color change was observed. The absorption ratios (A625\/A395) of the modified AgNP solution exhibited a linear correlation with Pb(2+) ion concentrations within the linear range of 0.1-0.6 \u03bcg mL(-1), and the limits of detection in tap and pond water were 0.02 and 0.06 \u03bcg mL(-1), respectively. This cost-effective sensing system allows for the rapid and facile determination of Pb(2+) ions in aqueous samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002247","authors":["Noh, Kwon-Chul","Nam, Yun-Sik","Lee, Ho-Jin","Lee, Kang-Bong"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5an01601k","endpage":"8216","first_seen_on":"2016-07-20T19:57:41+00:00","issns":["1364-5528","0003-2654"],"issue":"24","journal":"Analyst","last_mentioned_on":1469044630,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26555436?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26555436","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"8209","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"\n              A colorimetric probe to determine Pb\n              2+\n              using functionalized silver nanoparticles\n            ","type":"article","volume":"140","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/colorimetric-probe-determine-pb-sup2sup-using-functionalized-silver-nanoparticles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085102,"mean":6.8782317593723,"rank":7000185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085102,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257817,"mean":11.979364197722,"rank":217984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257817,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2079,"mean":2.9225178055823,"rank":1684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2079,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":1.4951851851852,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
