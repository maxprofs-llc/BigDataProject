Studies analyzing structural abnormalities have shown conflicting results, possibly related to confounding factors. We investigated the nucleus accumbens volume using manual delimitation in first-episode psychosis (FEP) controlling for age, cannabis use and medication. Thirty-one FEP subjects who were naive or minimally exposed to antipsychotics and a control group were MRI scanned and clinically assessed from baseline to 6 months of follow-up. FEP showed increased relative and total accumbens volumes. Clinical correlations with negative symptoms, duration of untreated psychosis and cannabis use were not significant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d3","authors":["Mireia Forns-Nadal","Daniel Berg\u00e9","Federico Sem","Anna Man\u00e9","Laura Igual","Dani Guinart","Oscar Vilarroya"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pscychresns.2017.03.007","first_seen_on":"2017-04-03T11:30:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09254927"],"journal":"Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging Section","last_mentioned_on":1505727802,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0925492716301421&_version=1&md5=cd151060236b75a160e76d77a113c300","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0925492716301421","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.pscychresns.2017.03.007"],"pmid":"28340425","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Increased nucleus accumbens volume in first-episode psychosis","type":"article","volume":"263","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-nucleus-accumbens-volume-firstepisode-psychosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":4502889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2348423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249593,"mean":13.130157913715,"rank":140398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":86168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249593,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":530,"mean":3.2585746691871,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":530,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":9.1529523809524,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
