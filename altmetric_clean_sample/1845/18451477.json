The family home is the location of injury in 84% of cases and in 79% the patient was aged 2 years of age or younger. Total body surface area ranged from 0.5% to 20% with a median of 1.75% (IQR 0.63, 3.38%). In our study 8% of patients underwent grafting and 24% received follow up for scar management. Injuries occurred in rental properties in 47% of tempering valve survey respondents. The rate of installation of tempering valves was 23%.\nBathroom scald burns continue to be over-represented in inpatient data. Tempering valves were not consistently installed after injury, this intervention would require further legislation to be an effective prevention strategy.\nThis study provides important insights into paediatric bathroom scald injuries and will assist with the development of prevention strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000247d","authors":["Gole, Hobia","Kimble, Roy","Stockton,
