In this study, the effects of exercise-induced HSP72 expression levels on whole-body insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic rats were investigated. Male 25-week-old Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats were divided into three groups: sedentary (Sed), trained in a thermal-neutral environment (NTr: 25\u00a0\u00b0C), and trained in a cold environment (CTr: 4\u00a0\u00b0C). Exercise training was conducted 5\u00a0days\/week for 10\u00a0weeks. Rectal temperature was measured following each bout of exercise. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed after the training sessions. The serum, gastrocnemius muscle, and liver were sampled 48\u00a0h after the final exercise session. HSP72 and heat shock cognate protein 73 expression levels were analyzed by Western blot, and serum total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid (FFA) levels were measured. NTr animals exhibited significantly higher body temperatures following exercise, whereas, CTr animals did not. Exercise training increased HSP72 levels in the gastrocnemius muscle and liver, whereas, HSP72 expression was significantly lower in the CTr group than that in the NTr group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Glucose tolerance improved equally in both trained animals; however, insulin levels during the IPGTT were higher in CTr animals than those in NTr animals (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, the TG and FFA levels decreased significantly only in NTr animals compared with those in Sed animals. These results suggest that attenuation of exercise-induced HSP72 expression partially blunts improvement in whole-body insulin resistance and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetic rats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e20","authors":["Takamasa Tsuzuki","Hiroyuki Kobayashi","Toshinori Yoshihara","Ryo Kakigi","Noriko Ichinoseki-Sekine","Hisashi Naito"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12192-017-0767-z","first_seen_on":"2017-04-03T08:24:10+00:00","issns":["1355-8145","1466-1268"],"journal":"Cell Stress and Chaperones","last_mentioned_on":1491531108,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28155127"],"pmid":"28155127","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Attenuation of exercise-induced heat shock protein 72 expression blunts improvements in whole-body insulin resistance in rats with type 2 diabetes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attenuation-exerciseinduced-heat-shock-protein-72-expression-blunts-improvements-wholebody-insulin-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.3,"score_history":{"1y":5.3,"6m":5.3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":1435696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6563320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234097,"mean":12.92649095243,"rank":59280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":174543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234097,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228,"mean":2.5161145374449,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.9,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
