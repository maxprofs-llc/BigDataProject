The objective of this study is to determine predominant lip print pattern found among a central Indian population, to evaluate whether any sex difference exists and to study the permanence of the pattern over a 6\u00a0month duration. This study included 200 healthy adult subjects comprising of 100 males and 100 females in the age group of 18-25\u00a0years. A convenient and easier method of data collection i.e., digital photography was used instead of the traditional lipstick methods. Lip prints were then divided into four quadrants and recognized as per Suzuki and Tsuchihashi's classification. Type I (30.63%) was found to be most predominant overall in the Marathi population. Type I (29.75%) and Type III (35.75%) were found most prevalent in males and females respectively. Applying the Chi-Square test, statistically significant differences (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were observed between male and female lip print patterns in each of the quadrants individually and all quadrants taken together. The lip print patterns remained stable over a period of six-months. Being stable and with significant sex differences, lip prints can be effectively used as an important tool in forensic investigations for individualization as well as identification of sex of the donor, thus, narrowing down the scope of investigation to almost half.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f61000888f","authors":["Neeti Kapoor","Ashish Badiye"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.sjbs.2015.01.014","first_seen_on":"2017-09-04T10:55:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1319562X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1504522544,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5562378\/"],"pmcid":"PMC5562378","pmid":"28855806","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1149","title":"A study of distribution, sex differences and stability of lip print patterns in an Indian population","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-distribution-sex-differences-stability-lip-print-patterns-indian-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360463,"mean":7.0503912403329,"rank":7227076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360463,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116638,"mean":12.011203374573,"rank":94542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116638,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214,"mean":2.1047981220657,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":5,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Linguistics":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1},"mendeley":{"HU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GacetaCienForen\/statuses\/904659235111350273","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24752364],"posted_on":"2017-09-04T10:55:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Gac Ciencia Forense","url":"http:\/\/www.uv.es\/gicf\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566123006179545089\/yXGddJpq_normal.jpeg","description":"Gaceta Internacional de Ciencias Forenses \/ International Gazette of Forensic Sciences.
