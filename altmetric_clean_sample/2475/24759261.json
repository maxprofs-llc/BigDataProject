(free)\u2026"],"citation":{"abstract":"Background Funding for implant-based treatment within secondary care is limited, and acceptance criteria are determined locally according to funding agreements with NHS England. Indefinite review of all patients in secondary care is unlikely to be feasible due to limitations on departmental capacity. The increasing number of patients provided with implant-based treatment in secondary care has resulted in a growing maintenance burden, raising the question of who should provide this care. Management of some complications within primary care would facilitate patients' access to treatment, although no specific provision for maintenance of implant-retained prostheses is made within the NHS Dental Charges Regulations.Materials and methods An online survey was carried out to review services provided within restorative dentistry departments across the UK, investigating departmental protocols for review and maintenance of patients provided with dental implants.Results There was no consensus view on review protocols, discharge or provision of maintenance following implant placement. Fifty-seven percent would indefinitely carry out remake of implant-retained overdentures when clinically indicated, replace worn inserts, housings or abutments. Sixty-one percent would manage loose\/lost screw- or cement-retained restorations and 68% would manage fractured restorations. Re-referral for peri-implant disease would be accepted by 64% of respondents. The lack of clear NHS funding for the management of complications was of concern to respondents in this survey.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002438","authors":["H. P. Beddis","K. A. Durey","M.
