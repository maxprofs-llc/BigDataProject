However, it is unclear whether virtual reality training can have an impact on the surgical performance of advanced\u00a0laparoscopic procedures. Our objective was to assess the ability of the virtual reality simulator LAP Mentor to identify and quantify\u00a0changes in surgical performance indicators, after LAP Mentor training for digestive anastomosis.\nTwelve surgeons from Centro Hospitalar de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o in Porto (Portugal) performed two sessions of advanced\u00a0task 5: anastomosis in LAP Mentor, before and after completing the tutorial, and were evaluated on 34 surgical performance indicators.\nThe results show that six surgical performance indicators significantly changed after LAP Mentor training. The surgeons\u00a0performed the task significantly faster as the median 'total time' significantly reduced (p < 0.05) from 759.5 to 523.5 seconds. Significant\u00a0decreases (p < 0.05) were also found in median 'total needle loading time' (303.3 to 107.8 seconds), 'average needle loading time'\u00a0(38.5 to 31.0 seconds), 'number of passages in which the needle passed precisely through the entrance dots' (2.5 to 1.0), 'time the\u00a0needle was held outside the visible field' (20.9 to 2.4 seconds), and 'total time the needle-holders' ends are kept outside the predefined\u00a0operative field' (88.2 to 49.6 seconds).\nThis study raises the possibility of using virtual reality training simulation as a benchmark tool to assess the surgical\u00a0performance of Portuguese surgeons.\nLAP Mentor is able to identify variations in surgical performance indicators of digestive anastomosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6563cf058f61000917d","authors":["Muralha, Nuno","Oliveira, Manuel","Ferreira, Maria Am\u00e9lia","Costa-Maia, Jos\u00e9"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-04T10:15:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1646-0758"],"issue":"5","journal":"Acta Medica Portuguesa","last_mentioned_on":1504520103,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28865503?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28865503","pubdate":"2017-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Virtual Reality Simulation as a Tool to Monitor Surgical Performance Indicators: VIRESI Observational Study.","type":"article","volume":"30"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360463,"mean":7.0503912403329,"rank":7227073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360463,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116629,"mean":12.012083530542,"rank":94539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116629,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":1.4786871165644,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/904648996664119296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24750659],"posted_on":"2017-09-04T10:15:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"904648996664119296"}]}}
