The hybrid schedule was devised to be pharmacologically superior in chronic leukemia based on unbound exposure.\nData from 129 patients in 3 FLAM studies were used for pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic modeling. Newly diagnosed (62%) or relapsed\/refractory (38%) patients were treated by bolus (43%) or hybrid schedule (57%). Total and unbound flavopiridol concentrations were fit using non-linear mixed-effect population pharmacokinetic methodologies. Exposure-response relationships using unbound flavopiridol AUC were explored using recursive partitioning.\nFlavopiridol pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a two-compartment model. No pharmacokinetic covariates were identified. Flavopiridol fraction unbound was 10.9% and not different between schedules. Partitioning found no association between dosing schedule and clinical response. Clinical response was associated with AUC \u2265 780 h*ng\/mL for newly diagnosed patients and AUC \u2265 1690 h*ng\/mL for relapsed\/refractory patients. Higher exposures were not associated with increases in severe adverse events (\u2265 grade 3).\nPharmacokinetic modeling showed no difference in flavopiridol plasma protein binding for bolus versus hybrid dosing. Further trials in newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients should utilize the bolus FLAM regimen at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 50 mg\/m2\/day. Trials in relapsed\/refractory patients should use the hybrid dosing schedule at the MTD (30\/60 mg\/m2\/day) in order to achieve the higher exposures required for maximal efficacy in this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Carl LaCerte","Vijay Deep Ivaturi","Jogarao Gobburu","Jacqueline M.
