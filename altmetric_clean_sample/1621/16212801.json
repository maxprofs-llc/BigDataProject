Moreover, the unusual ESI induced fragmentation was observed for 2. Hence, efforts were made towards the understanding of the structure of 2, which was crucial for the understanding of the reaction mechanism.\nThe isolated impurity was fully characterized by liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC\/HRMS\/MS), hydrogen\/deuterium (H\/D) exchange, and an ensemble of 2D-NMR techniques. DFT calculation was also conducted.\nAn unusual ESI-induced fragmentation was observed for intermediate 2, giving an ion for half of the molecule in the positive ion mode, with the other half of the molecule affording an ion in the negative ionization mode. To the best of our knowledge, this unique ESI-induced fragmentation had not been previously reported in the literature. The underlying mechanism was explored and is supported by DFT calculation, which could greatly help the structural characterization of unknown impurities with similar structural features using ESI-MS in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086ec","authors":["Sheng, Huaming","Lexa, Katrina W.","Zhang, Li\u2010Kang","Yang, Rong\u2010Sheng","Wright, Timothy J.","Sherry, Benjamin D.","Helmy, Roy","Martin, Gary E."],"doi":"10.1002\/rcm.7833","first_seen_on":"2017-02-08T02:45:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0951-4198","1097-0231","09514198"],"journal":"Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","last_mentioned_on":1486534804,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.7833\/abstract;jsessionid=8C7796B5F611D81F8B2BECFA1FA0225B.f01t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.7833\/abstract;jsessionid=54846AA0200443CCAF2BF1BF55CE49B3.f04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/rcm.7833&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.7833\/pdf","pmid":"28171682","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Unusual (+\/-)-Electrospray Ionization Induced Fragmentation: Structural Elucidation of an In-process Synthetic Intermediate of Doravirine (MK-1439) Using LC\/HRMS\/MS and 2D-NMR","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unusual-electrospray-ionization-induced-fragmentation-structural-elucidation-inprocess-synthetic-int"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177609,"mean":6.9186386481167,"rank":4334462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2270713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177609,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264235,"mean":12.843637442569,"rank":150689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":87264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264235,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1763,"mean":1.617160045403,"rank":588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1763,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":2.2081428571429,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
