Injury was caused by dropping a 10\u00a0kg weight one time from 1\u00a0m directly above the knee in extension. One hour after impact 20\u00a0\u03bcg\/ml IRAP solution was intra-articularly injected. At 8\u00a0h post-injury, cartilage samples were harvested for cell viability and genetic expression analysis. Genetic expression of miR-27b, miR-140, miR-125b, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, MMP-3, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 were analyzed by RT-PCR. Cell viability image analysis was performed using ImageJ software. Groups were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. A P-value <0.05 was considered significant.\nAt 8\u00a0h after IRAP treatment, expressions of ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, MMP-3, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 in cartilage were significantly down-regulated from injury group (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). MiR-140, miR-125b, and miR-27b expressions were significantly up-regulated after treatment as compared to control and injury groups (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThis study demonstrates that IRAP treatment administered during acute phase of cartilage impact injury increases expression levels of miR-140, miR-125b, and miR-27b in cartilage, indicating increased inhibition of their respective matrix-degrading enzymes. Clinically, these findings support the potential of IRAP treatment as an early intervention strategy for the prevention of cartilage degeneration after impact injury.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008411","authors":["Genemaras, A A","Reiner, T","Huang, C-Y","Kaplan, L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.joca.2015.05.010","first_seen_on":"2015-11-03T22:05:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1522-9653"],"issue":"11","journal":"Osteoarthritis and Cartilage","last_mentioned_on":1446588361,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26521750?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26521750","pubdate":"2015-11-04T22:02:52+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology","orthopedics"],"title":"Early intervention with Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist Protein modulates catabolic microRNA and mRNA expression in cartilage after impact injury.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-intervention-interleukin1-receptor-antagonist-protein-modulates-catabolic-microrna-mrna-expres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6526504,"mean":6.0446498766627,"rank":4587026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1699984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6526504,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208913,"mean":10.273236405759,"rank":133642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":65408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208913,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":894,"mean":5.3227547592385,"rank":677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":894,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":3.6458333333333,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
