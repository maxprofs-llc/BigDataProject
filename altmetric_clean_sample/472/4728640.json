The CEII tool is then applied to empirically measure the extent of environmental impacts of High Yield Variety (HYV) rice cultivation in three districts of north-western Bangladesh for a single crop year (October, 2012-September, 2013). Results reveal that 27 to 69 per cent of the theoretical maximum level of environmental damage is created due to HYV rice cultivation with significant regional variations in the CEII scores, implying that policy interventions are required in environmentally critical areas in order to sustain agriculture in Bangladesh.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f13cf058f610002d88","authors":["Sabiha, Noor-E","Salim, Ruhul","Rahman, Sanzidur","Rola-Rubzen, Maria Fay","Noor-E.
