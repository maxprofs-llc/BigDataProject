Patients with memory complaints referred for possible dementia underwent the MMSE, followed by standardized neuropsychological and clinical assessments which led to a consensus diagnosis. MMSE cut-off points were derived stratified for education (less and equal\/above primary level). Results show that after education stratification, using an optimal Positive Likelihood Ratio (PLR) and optimal Negative Likelihood Ratio (NLR), a higher percentage of patients were correctly identified as having dementia or dementia-free, with minimal misclassification rate. The finding suggests the MMSE can be used to exclude patients not requiring full neuropsychological assessments in a memory clinic.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f07","authors":["Xin Xu"],"doi":"10.3390\/diagnostics5040475","first_seen_on":"2015-11-05T01:32:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2075-4418"],"issue":"4","journal":"Diagnostics","last_mentioned_on":1446687125,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2075-4418\/5\/4\/475"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2075-4418\/5\/4\/475\/pdf","pmid":"26854165","pubdate":"2015-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Beyond Screening: Can the Mini-Mental State Examination be Used as an Exclusion Tool in a Memory Clinic?","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/beyond-screening-minimental-state-examination-used-exclusion-tool-memory-clinic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6534476,"mean":6.0547106645891,"rank":3099535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1952593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6534476,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209577,"mean":10.278969185403,"rank":112856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":75707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209577,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":3.3781971830986,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.8727272727273,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"SG":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/diagnostic_mdpi\/statuses\/662079907917271040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4725459],"posted_on":"2015-11-05T01:32:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Diagnostics_MDPI","url":"https:\/\/t.co\/PiRSGZVgig","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/647343179776159748\/SauzDOyF_normal.png","description":"An #openaccess journal on medical #diagnostics in #WoS, full-text archived in #PubMed Central, published by @MDPIOpenAcess.","id_on_source":"diagnostic_mdpi","tweeter_id":"3679683390","followers":59},"tweet_id":"662079907917271040"}]}}
