The parameters designed by the procedure are valid in oscillator networks with any network topology and with any connection delay. The validity of the design procedure is confirmed by numerical simulation. We also consider a partial time-varying delay connection, which has both time-invariant and time-varying delays. The effectiveness of the partial connection is shown theoretically and numerically.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008518","authors":["Sugitani, Yoshiki","Konishi, Keiji","Hara, Naoyuki"],"doi":"10.1103\/physreve.92.042928","first_seen_on":"2015-11-04T02:24:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1550-2376"],"issue":"4","journal":"Physical Review E: Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics","last_mentioned_on":1446623013,"links":["http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/pre\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevE.92.042928"],"pmid":"26565325","pubdate":"2015-11-14T22:01:41+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biophysics","physiology","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Delay- and topology-independent design for inducing amplitude death on networks with time-varying delay connections","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/delay-topologyindependent-design-inducing-amplitude-death-networks-timevarying-delay-connections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7387729,"mean":6.4191974073719,"rank":5329931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1799671,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7387729,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239843,"mean":9.5584712018745,"rank":149353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":74879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239843,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5212,"mean":2.0540644789868,"rank":2342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5212,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":5.4648695652174,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
