This study evaluated through a pot experiment four bioremediation strategies: a) natural attenuation, b) phytoremediation with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), c) bioaugmentation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and d) bioaugmentation-assisted phytoremediation, for the treatment of a co-contaminated soil presenting moderate levels of heavy metals (Cu, Pb and Zn at 87, 100 and 110mgkg(-1) DW, respectively) and petroleum hydrocarbons (3800mgkg(-1) DW). As demonstrated by plant biomass and selected physiological parameters alfalfa plants were able to tolerate and grow in the co-contaminated soil, especially when soil was inoculated with P. aeruginosa, which promoted plant growth (56% and 105% increase for shoots and roots, respectively) and appeared to alleviate plant stress. The content of heavy metals in alfalfa plants was limited and followed the order: Zn>Cu>Pb. Heavy metals were mainly concentrated in plant roots and were poorly translocated, favouring their stabilization in the root zone. Bioaugmentation of planted soil with P. aeruginosa generally led to a decrease of plant metal concentration and translocation. The highest degree of total petroleum hydrocarbon removal was obtained for bioaugmentation-assisted phytoremediation treatment (68%), followed by bioaugmentation (59%), phytoremediation (47%) and natural attenuation (37%). The results of this study demonstrated that the combined use of plant and bacteria was the most advantageous option for the treatment of the present co-contaminated soil, as compared to natural attenuation, bioaugmentation or phytoremediation applied alone.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Agnello, A C","Bagard, M","van Hullebusch, E D","Esposito, G","Huguenot, D"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2015.10.061","first_seen_on":"2015-11-04T14:47:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1026"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1446690244,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26524994?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26524994","pubdate":"2015-11-04T22:01:44+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Comparative bioremediation of heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons co-contaminated soil by natural attenuation, phytoremediation, bioaugmentation and bioaugmentation-assisted phytoremediation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-bioremediation-heavy-metals-petroleum-hydrocarbons-cocontaminated-soil-natural-attenuati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6534476,"mean":6.0547106645891,"rank":2899514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3459779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6534476,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209382,"mean":10.279639604358,"rank":102829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":97780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209382,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3042,"mean":4.6810141400855,"rank":1449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3042,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":3.1561538461538,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":6,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
