Celiac disease is a prominent autoimmune disorder and requires a strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to identify suitable combinations of enzymatic hydrolysis and common unit operations in food processing (centrifugation, ultrafiltration) to produce gluten-free wheat gluten hydrolysates for food application. To analyze the hydrolysates, a simple and cheap competitive ELISA protocol was designed and validated in this study as well.\nThe competitive ELISA was validated using gliadin spiked skim milk protein hydrolysates, due to the latter application of the assay. The limit of quantification was 4.19\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) , which allowed the identification of gluten-free (<20\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) ) hydrolysates. Enzymatic hydrolysis, including the type of peptidase, and the downstream processing highly affected the antigenicity of the hydrolysates.\nEnzymatic hydrolysis and downstream processing operations, such as centrifugation and ultrafiltration, reduced the antigenicity of wheat gluten hydrolysates. Gluten-free hydrolysates were obtained with Flavourzyme after centrifugation (25\u2009g\u2009L(-1) substrate) and after 1 kDa ultrafiltration (100\u2009g\u2009L(-1) substrate). A multiple peptidase complex, such as Flavourzyme, seems to be required for the production of gluten-free hydrolysates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ee9","authors":["Merz, Michael","Kettner, Lucas","Langolf, Emma","Appel, Daniel","Blank, Imre","Stressler, Timo","Fischer, Lutz","Michael Merz","Lucas Kettner","Emma Langolf","Daniel Appel","Imre Blank","Timo Stressler","Lutz Fischer"],"doi":"10.1002\/jsfa.7515","first_seen_on":"2015-11-04T14:26:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1097-0010","00225142"],"journal":"Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture","last_mentioned_on":1493957948,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26526345?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26526345?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26526345?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26526345","pubdate":"2015-11-04T22:01:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Production of wheat gluten hydrolysates with reduced antigenicity employing enzymatic hydrolysis combined with downstream unit operations.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/production-wheat-gluten-hydrolysates-reduced-antigenicity-employing-enzymatic-hydrolysis-combined-do"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":7063039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244523,"mean":9.8033698890078,"rank":202933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244523,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1432,"mean":3.0884486373166,"rank":1020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1432,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.9390222222222,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
