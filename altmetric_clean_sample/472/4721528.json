To provide reference values for pediatric PSG.\n107 OSAS children diagnosed by PSG from January 2004 to May 2006 were randomly selected. The decrease in arterial oxygen saturation (\u0394SaO2) and the corresponding event duration of each respiratory event were observed.\n(1) There was significant positive correlation between oxygen desaturation values (\u0394SaO2=0-17%) and the corresponding durations of respiratory events (P<0.001). (2) There was no significant difference in durations of respiratory events in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and NREM sleep, the demographics between male and female children. (3) Significant positive correlation between age and duration of respiratory events (apnea\/hypopnea) when oxygen desaturation values equal to 4% (\u0394SaO2=4%) was observed. (4) The lower limit of 95% confidence intervals of which duration of oxygen desaturation value equals to 4% was 5.4s.\n(1) PSG studies may allow the establishment of the duration criterion of significant respiratory events; (2) 5.4s can be defined as duration criteria of respiratory events; (3) the present study provides reference values for Pediatric PSG.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b88","authors":["Li, Hongbin","Ge, Wentong","Tai, Jun","Zhanga, Jie","Wang, Xiaoyi","Li, Zhuo","Ni, Xin","Ye, Jingying"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijporl.2015.10.045","first_seen_on":"2015-11-04T06:10:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0165-5876","1872-8464"],"journal":"International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1449060865,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijporlonline.com\/article\/S0165-5876(15)00552-2\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26620229?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijporlonline.com\/article\/S0165587615005522\/pdf","pmid":"26620229","pubdate":"2015-12-02T14:06:24+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology","pediatrics"],"title":"Duration criterion of respiratory events for children with obstructive sleep apnea.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/duration-criterion-respiratory-events-children-obstructive-sleep-apnea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6640754,"mean":6.1509604181908,"rank":5666620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6640754,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210519,"mean":10.307687542158,"rank":168352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210519,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1519,"mean":1.8896179183136,"rank":1213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1519,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":1.2851058823529,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
