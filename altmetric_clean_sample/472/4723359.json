Large tumor size and the effect of radiation create cosmetic deformities in the shape of the breast after lumpectomy alone. Volume loss, nipple displacement, and asymmetry of the contralateral breast are just a few concerns. Reconstruction of lumpectomy defects with local tissue rearrangement in concert with reduction and mastopexy techniques have allowed for outstanding aesthetic results. In patients who have a reasonable tumor- to breast-size ratio, this oncoplastic surgery can successfully treat the patient's cancer while often improving upon preoperative breast shape. Specific surgical guidelines in reduction and mastopexy help achieve predictable aesthetic results, despite the effects of radiation, and can allow for a single surgical procedure for cancer removal, reconstruction, and contralateral symmetry in one stage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003513","authors":["Rose, Jessica F","Colen, Jessica Suarez","Ellsworth, Warren A","Jessica Rose","Jessica Colen","Warren Ellsworth"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0035-1549051","endpage":"109","first_seen_on":"2015-11-04T15:01:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-2188","1536-0067"],"issue":"2","journal":"Seminars in Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1446649278,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26528086?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26528086","pubdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"102","title":"Reduction and Mastopexy Techniques for Optimal Results in Oncoplastic Breast Reconstruction.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.thieme-connect.de\/DOI\/DOI?10.1055\/s-0035-1549051","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduction-mastopexy-techniques-optimal-results-oncoplastic-breast-reconstruction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7082673,"mean":6.2886849307689,"rank":5308934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":991652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7082673,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238680,"mean":9.4936274913168,"rank":163257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238680,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":3.367,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
