We retrospectively reviewed the data of 159 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who underwent AVF creation. The preoperative factors such as demographic, comorbidity condition, laboratory parameters and medication, and intraoperative or surgical-related factors were assessed. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, significant predictive factors of early AVF failure were female gender (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.63 (1.19-5.81); P\u2009=\u20090.017), higher body mass index (P\u2009=\u20090.038), and lower hemoglobin level (P\u2009=\u20090.048), while adjusting for preoperative factors or all factors. For adjusting of intraoperative factors, reduced venous diameter (P\u2009=\u20090.056) tended to be associated with early AVF failure. In conclusion, female gender, higher body mass index and lower hemoglobin level predicted the occurrence of early AVF failure in ESRD patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b5a","authors":["Yap, Yit\u2010Sheung","Chuang, Hung\u2010Yi","Wu, Chien\u2010Hung","Chi, Wen\u2010Che","Lin, Cheng\u2010Hao","Liu, Yi\u2010Chun"],"doi":"10.1111\/1744-9987.12323","endpage":"597","first_seen_on":"2015-11-05T19:37:11+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1744-9987"],"issue":"6","journal":"Therapeutic Apheresis and Dialysis","last_mentioned_on":1446752212,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/1744-9987.12323"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1744-9987.12323\/pdf","pmid":"26419831","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"590","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Preoperative and Intraoperative Factors for Early Failure of Native Arteriovenous Fistulas","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preoperative-intraoperative-factors-early-failure-native-arteriovenous-fistulas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6534476,"mean":6.0547106645891,"rank":3099534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1952594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6534476,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209577,"mean":10.278969185403,"rank":112856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":75707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209577,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":1.5676744186047,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.70833333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Nephrology_News\/statuses\/662352904074973184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4729387],"posted_on":"2015-11-05T19:36:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Nephrology News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/480105246220242945\/QBHXmGjB_normal.png","description":"Official account for Nephrology News\nConsultant of Nephrology - Zagazig university - Egypt","id_on_source":"Nephrology_News","tweeter_id":"327907888","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":370},"tweet_id":"662352904074973184"}]}}
