Under physiological conditions, a fine balance and mutually beneficial relationship is present. Disruption of this balance is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Whether an altered microbiome is the consequence or the cause of IBD is currently not fully understood. The pathogenesis of IBD is believed to be a complex interaction between genetic predisposition, the immune system and environmental factors. In the recent years, metagenomic studies of the human microbiome have provided useful data that are helping to assemble the IBD puzzle. In this review, we summarize and discuss current knowledge on the composition of the intestinal microbiota in IBD, host-microbe interactions and therapeutic possibilities using bacteria in IBD. Moreover, an outlook on the possible contribution of bacteriophages in the pathogenesis and therapy of IBD is provided.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Babickova, Janka","Gardlik, Roman","Janka Babickova","Roman Gardlik"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.v21.i40.11321","first_seen_on":"2015-11-04T14:39:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2219-2840","1007-9327"],"issue":"40","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1502866737,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26525290?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4616208\/"],"pmid":"26525290","pubdate":"2015-11-04T22:01:37+00:00","publisher":"Baishideng Publishing Group Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"11321","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Pathological and therapeutic interactions between bacteriophages, microbes and the host in inflammatory bowel disease.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathological-therapeutic-interactions-between-bacteriophages-microbes-host-inflammatory-bowel-diseas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":4231425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3938977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246686,"mean":9.8013054218942,"rank":117061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":119528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246686,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3708,"mean":3.2973067170218,"rank":1420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3708,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":1.8519480519481,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
