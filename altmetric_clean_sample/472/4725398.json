Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with eight New Zealand livestock farmers. Interviews were inductively analysed to derive categories that helped explain the processes involved in quad-bike incident risk perception.\nFarmers perceived personal risk of experiencing a quad-bike incident could be modelled on a sliding scale from low to high. Four core categories encapsulated risk perception: the impact of previous quad-bike incidents; personal attributes; getting the job done; and being familiar with the performance of the quad bike, the terrain and task(s) being undertaken. An exploratory model was developed to elucidate the temporal gap between farmers' reflections on their perceived risk and reported real-time risk management.\nThese findings have implications for planning quad-bike safety interventions, which may benefit from incorporating both 'reflective' contemplation of risks and skills for coping with things suddenly going wrong 'in the moment'.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ec3cf058f610005d62","authors":["Clay, Lynne","Hay\u2010Smith, Jean","Treharne, Gareth","Milosavljevic, Stephan"],"doi":"10.1111\/1753-6405.12454","endpage":"61","first_seen_on":"2015-11-05T01:11:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1753-6405"],"issue":"1","journal":"Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1454958553,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/1753-6405.12454\/","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1753-6405.12454\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1753-6405.12454\/pdf","pmid":"26456529","pubdate":"2015-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"55","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"\u201cThere are risks to be taken and some just push it too far\u201d: how farmers perceive quad\u2010bike incident risk","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risks-taken-some-just-push-it-far-farmers-perceive-quadbike-incident-risk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.15,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7140824,"mean":6.3067650711939,"rank":1081212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6057972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7140824,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239125,"mean":9.5034516652448,"rank":47894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":191107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239125,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":903,"mean":7.3025232815965,"rank":202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":903,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":10.296666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":4,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":7}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/anzjph\/statuses\/662074657080610818","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4725398],"posted_on":"2015-11-05T01:11:13+00:00","author":{"name":"ANZJPH","url":"http:\/\/www.phaa.net.au","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/776273259541049344\/nAVBgdS-_normal.jpg","description":"The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health is the official publication of the Public Health Association of Australia","id_on_source":"anzjph","tweeter_id":"3248477864","geo":{"lt":-25,"ln":135,"country":"AU"},"followers":645},"tweet_id":"662074657080610818"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/croakeyblog\/statuses\/662097302333452292","license":"gnip","rt":["anzjph"],"citation_ids":[4725398],"posted_on":"2015-11-05T02:41:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Melissa Sweet","url":"http:\/\/croakey.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/638968113036267520\/QSBZ4Qi4_normal.jpg","description":"Independent journalist sharing news re public health, health policy, Indigenous health, equity, climate & health, journalism.
