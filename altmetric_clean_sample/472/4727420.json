As measuring RDW is subject to technology, we have investigated if this relation also exists when using a different hematology analyzer, Abbott CELL-DYN Sapphire. In addition, as RDW is generally expressed relative to mean red blood cell volume (MCV), we have explored how MCV influences the age-dependency of RDW.\nWe measured RDW and MCV in a large cohort and calculated RDW-SD (the \"absolute\" RDW), which does not contain MCV. For establishing reference intervals we used Bhattacharya statistics.\nIn our study cohort of 8089 individuals we found a strong association between RDW and age, but not with gender. Also MCV showed an age-related increase over the entire age range. The conventional RDW increased by 6% from the youngest to oldest age class, whereas RDW-SD increased by nearly 15%. This difference was caused by a mean age-related increase in MCV of 6.6%. Age-dependent reference intervals were established for RDW, RDW-SD and MCV.\nThe age-dependency of RDW seems to be a universal biological feature rather than related with a single type of hematology analyzer. As not only RDW, but also MCV increases with age, we propose that future studies on the prognostic significance of RDW take its age-dependency into account and focus on RDW-SD as a potential marker of adverse events in many clinical conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002551","authors":["Hoffmann, Johannes J M L","Nabbe, Karin C A M","van den Broek, Nicole M A"],"doi":"10.1515\/cclm-2015-0155","first_seen_on":"2015-11-05T11:32:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1437-4331"],"issue":"12","journal":"Clinical Chemistry & Laboratory Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1446723136,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26536583?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26536583?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=Pubmed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26536583","pubdate":"2015-11-05T22:00:07+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","chemistryclinical"],"title":"Effect of age and gender on reference intervals of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and mean red cell volume (MCV).","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-age-gender-reference-intervals-red-blood-cell-distribution-width-rdw-mean-red-cell-volume-mcv-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6534476,"mean":6.0547106645891,"rank":4592684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1701892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6534476,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209577,"mean":10.278971571172,"rank":134003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":65683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209577,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1031,"mean":1.6549961165049,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1031,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":1.0721052631579,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/labhuc\/statuses\/662230921815322624","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4727420],"posted_on":"2015-11-05T11:32:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Lab Central HUC","url":"http:\/\/www.laboratoriocentral.es","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2294146713\/yko65x8amimlhldy5b0t_normal.jpeg","description":"Laboratorio Central del Hospital Universitario de Canarias","id_on_source":"labhuc","tweeter_id":"22674542","geo":{"lt":28.4853,"ln":-16.32014,"country":"ES"},"followers":285},"tweet_id":"662230921815322624"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ClinChemINFO\/statuses\/662230949829062659","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4727420],"posted_on":"2015-11-05T11:32:16+00:00","author":{"name":"ClinChemINFO","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalchemistry.info","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/556141595234275329\/392ECMgd_normal.png","id_on_source":"ClinChemINFO","tweeter_id":"2981358863","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":540},"tweet_id":"662230949829062659"}]}}
