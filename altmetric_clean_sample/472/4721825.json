The former included 19\u2009233 children, and the latter included 10\u2009446 children, age 6 to 18 years. Waist circumferences were measured at the level of maximum waist narrowing in girls, and at the level of the top of the iliac crest in boys. Age- and sex-specific reference curves were fitted with the LMS method. Cut-off points were arbitrarily set at 85th, 90th, 95th, and 97th centiles, and compared with WC\/Ht 0.50.RESULTSThe proportion of children in whom WC\/Ht exceeded 0.50 was 18.7% of boys and 1.9% of girls, whereas the proportion of children exceeding 90th centile was 42.4% for boys and 17.3% for girls, respectively. The reference values decreased with age in girls but varied by age without a clear trend in boys.CONCLUSIONSThe first reference values for WC\/Ht are provided for Japanese youth based on the 1978-1981 national survey data. These curves are age- and sex-dependent, precluding the use of universal cut-off for WC\/Ht of 0.50.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 07 October 2015. doi:10.1038\/ijo.2015.203.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b83","authors":["M Inokuchi","N Matsuo","J I Takayama","T Hasegawa"],"doi":"10.1038\/ijo.2015.203","endpage":"70","first_seen_on":"2015-11-04T08:17:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5497","0307-0565"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1474574468,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/ijo\/rss\/aop\/~3\/3k27RnzGKAM\/ijo.2015.203","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/v40\/n1\/abs\/ijo2015203a.html"],"pmid":"26443338","pubdate":"2015-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"65","subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Waist-to-height ratio centiles by age and sex for Japanese children based on the 1978|[ndash]|1981 cross-sectional national survey data","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/waisttoheight-ratio-centiles-age-sex-japanese-children-based-19781981-crosssectional-national-survey"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":668787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7741199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246802,"mean":9.808739559402,"rank":27697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":218917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246802,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2495,"mean":16.200402566159,"rank":575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2495,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":24.466690909091,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
