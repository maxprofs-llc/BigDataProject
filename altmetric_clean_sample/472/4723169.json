In this study, we examine how cross-talk between the cytolinker plectin and F-actin controls keratin network organisation and the 3D nuclear morphology of keratinocytes. Using micro-patterned surfaces to precisely manipulate cell shape, we find that cell adhesion and spreading regulate the size and shape of the nucleus. Disruption of the keratin cytoskeleton through loss of plectin facilitated greater nuclear deformation, which depended on acto-myosin contractility. Nuclear morphology did not depend on direct linkage of the keratin cytoskeleton with the nuclear membrane, rather loss of plectin reduced keratin filament density around the nucleus. We further demonstrate that keratinocytes have abnormal nuclear morphologies in the epidermis of plectin-deficient, epidermolysis bullosa simplex patients. Together, our data demonstrate that plectin is an essential regulator of nuclear morphology in vitro and in vivo and protects the nucleus from mechanical deformation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce4","authors":["Almeida, Filipe V","Walko, Gernot","McMillan, James R","McGrath, John A","Wiche, Gerhard","Barber, Asa H","Connelly, John T"],"doi":"10.1242\/jcs.173435","first_seen_on":"2015-11-04T14:47:29+00:00","funders":["niehs","bbsrc"],"issns":["1477-9137"],"journal":"Journal of Cell Science","last_mentioned_on":1447332643,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26527396?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jcs.biologists.org\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/30\/jcs.173435.long"],"pmid":"26527396","pubdate":"2015-11-04T22:00:52+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"The cytolinker plectin regulates nuclear mechanotransduction in keratinocytes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytolinker-plectin-regulates-nuclear-mechanotransduction-keratinocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6562576,"mean":6.081396308004,"rank":4613093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1708418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6562576,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209749,"mean":10.281221675535,"rank":134255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":65583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209749,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2926,"mean":4.1845565811965,"rank":2278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2926,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":3.7094022988506,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
