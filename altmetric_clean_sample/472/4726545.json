During last years, several computer systems have been proposed in order to improve the diagnosis of PD, but their accuracy is still limited. In this work we demonstrate a full automatic computer system to assist the diagnosis of PD using (18)F-DMFP PET data. First, a few regions of interest are selected by means of a two-sample t-test. The accuracy of the selected regions to separate PD from APS patients is then computed using a support vector machine classifier. The accuracy values are finally used to train a Bayesian network that can be used to predict the class of new unseen data. This methodology was evaluated using a database with 87 neuroimages, achieving accuracy rates over 78%. A fair comparison with other similar approaches is also provided.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc0b","authors":["Segovia, Ferm\u00edn","Ill\u00e1n, Ignacio A.","G\u00f3rriz, Juan M.","Ram\u00edrez, Javier","Rominger, Axel","Levin, Johannes"],"doi":"10.3389\/fncom.2015.00137","first_seen_on":"2015-11-05T08:15:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-5188"],"journal":"Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1447231433,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fncom.2015.00137\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fncom.2015.00137\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4633498","pmid":"26594165","pubdate":"2015-11-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Distinguishing Parkinson's disease from atypical parkinsonian syndromes using PET data and a computer system based on support vector machines and Bayesian networks","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distinguishing-parkinsons-disease-atypical-parkinsonian-syndromes-using-pet-data-computer-system-bas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6559289,"mean":6.0768461753774,"rank":3116068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1958482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6559289,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209836,"mean":10.282818995878,"rank":113067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":75724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209836,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":578,"mean":5.1852201039861,"rank":384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":578,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":4.1645142857143,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontNeurosci\/statuses\/662181339383226369","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4726545],"posted_on":"2015-11-05T08:15:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Neurosci","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Neuroscience","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533283149308911617\/d_MmvG-x_normal.jpeg","description":"The official Twitter Feed for all the latest open-access, peer-reviewed articles in Frontiers in Neuroscience.","id_on_source":"FrontNeurosci","tweeter_id":"397306055","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":15831},"tweet_id":"662181339383226369"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jogiagroup\/statuses\/662230860704432128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4726545],"posted_on":"2015-11-05T11:31:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Jigar Jogia","url":"http:\/\/jogiagroup.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/433188757710176256\/E9598nzR_normal.png","description":"Dr Jigar Jogia's research \nAdvancing understanding of the brain in severe neurological & psychiatric disorders.#neuroscience #neuromarketing #mentalhealth","id_on_source":"jogiagroup","tweeter_id":"2336465087","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1234},"tweet_id":"662230860704432128"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/uranus_2\/statuses\/664362902745280512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4726545],"posted_on":"2015-11-11T08:43:53+00:00","author":{"name":"\u30de\u30fc\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\uff12\u4e16","url":"http:\/\/smetc.blog120.fc2.com\/?sp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/650483455248064512\/EOJq3sZX_normal.png","description":"\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3068\u3082\u5927\u5b66\u521d\u5e74\u6b21\u307e\u3067\u306f\u5834\u9762\u7dd8\u9ed9\u75c7\uff08\u81ea\u5df1\u8a3a\u65ad\uff09\u3060\u3063\u305f\u7537\u3002Twitter\u307e\u3068\u3081(http:\/\/psychobrain.seesaa.net\/)\u3002 \u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805\u2460\u8ad6\u6587\u306f\u8981\u7d04\u3057\u304b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u306a\u3044\u5834\u5408\u304c\u591a\u3044\u2461\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u2462\u79c1\u306f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002","id_on_source":"uranus_2","tweeter_id":"253847599","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3450},"tweet_id":"664362902745280512"}]}}
