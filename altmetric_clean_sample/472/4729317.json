(July 9 issue)(1) propose that underlying systemic mastocytosis should be considered in patients who have repeated episodes of anaphylaxis, even in the absence of clinical features of mast-cell hyperactivity. They also emphasize important triggers for anaphylaxis in such patients, including stings from insects of the order Hymenoptera. We would also suggest that systemic mastocytosis should be considered in patients in whom perioperative anaphylaxis develops, particularly in patients who have repeated episodes and who have received structurally unrelated drugs. Indeed, drug triggers are estimated to account for 5 to 25% of cases of anaphylaxis in .\u00a0.\u00a0.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031c4","authors":["Yoshida, Go J"],"doi":"10.1056\/nejmc1510021#sa2","first_seen_on":"2015-11-05T19:11:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-4406"],"issue":"19","journal":"New England Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1446750692,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26535530?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26535530","pubdate":"2015-11-05T22:00:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Mast Cells, Mastocytosis, and Related Disorders.","type":"article","volume":"373"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6534476,"mean":6.0547106645891,"rank":4832601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":960071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6534476,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209577,"mean":10.278972764057,"rank":143894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209577,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15559,"mean":43.418798688777,"rank":13316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":1432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15559,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":391,"mean":103.73680512821,"rank":288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":391,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/medicineupdate\/statuses\/662346527491252224","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4729317],"posted_on":"2015-11-05T19:11:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1K3w","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3388626222\/3c70af58befec0257424ebde88c5f261_normal.png","description":"The top 5 internal medicine journals","id_on_source":"medicineupdate","tweeter_id":"174988635","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3346},"tweet_id":"662346527491252224"}]}}
