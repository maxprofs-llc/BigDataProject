Muscle activity of M. triceps brachii (lateral head) was measured via surface electromyography and normalized to maximal voluntary excitation (%MVE).\nAccording to OMNI-level ratings, significant main effects were found for diagnostic condition (F=27.33, P<.001, \u03b7(2)=.11), indicating 0.7 (95% confidence interval, 0.3\u20121.1) lower mean OMNI-level ratings for MS; and for intensity level (F=46.81, P<.001, \u03b7(2)=.46), showing increased OMNI-level ratings for increased intensity levels for both groups. Furthermore, significant main effects were found for the diagnostic condition (F=16.52, P<.001, \u03b7(2)=.07), indicating 7.1% (95% confidence interval, -8.6\u201222.8) higher %MVE values for MS; and for intensity level (F=33.09, P<.001, \u03b7(2)=.36), showing higher relative muscle activities for increasing intensity levels in both groups.\nSimilar to controls, individuals with MS were able to differentiate between different intensities of weight during dynamic elbow extensions when provided in a single-blind, randomized order. Therefore, perceived muscular effort might be considered to control resistance training intensities in individuals with MS. However, training intensity for individuals with MS should be chosen at approximately one OMNI-level lower than recommended, at least for dynamic elbow extension exercise.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005737","authors":["Heller, Mario","Retzl, Irene","Kiselka, Anita","Greisberger, Andrea","Mario Heller","Irene Retzl","Anita Kiselka","Andrea Greisberger"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.apmr.2015.10.082","first_seen_on":"2015-11-04T14:25:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-821X","0003-9993","00039993"],"journal":"Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1450720980,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26525526?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.archives-pmr.org\/article\/S0003-9993(15)01327-1\/fulltext","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.apmr.2015.10.082"],"pmid":"26525526","pubdate":"2015-11-04T22:01:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Perception of Muscular Effort During Dynamic Elbow Extension in Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0003999315013271","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perception-muscular-effort-during-dynamic-elbow-extension-multiple-sclerosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7447574,"mean":6.4727325846912,"rank":2998341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4402383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7447574,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240353,"mean":9.5750674843562,"rank":84347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":153368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240353,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2591,"mean":4.875227027027,"rank":1439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2591,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":6.502380952381,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
