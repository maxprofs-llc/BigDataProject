Based on this, we developed a novel deep-seated tumor therapy modality with mitochondria-targeting single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as microwave absorbing agents, which act efficiently to convert ultra-short microwave energy into TA shock wave and selectively destroy the targeted mitochondria, thereby inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. After the treatment of SWNTs (40\u00a0\u03bcg\/mL) and ultra-short microwave (40\u00a0Hz, 1\u00a0min), 77.5% of cancer cells were killed and the vast majority were caused by apoptosis that initiates from mitochondrial damage. The orthotopic liver cancer mice were established as deep-seated tumor model to investigate the anti-tumor effect of mitochondria-targeting TA therapy. The results suggested that TA therapy could effectively inhibit the tumor growth without any observable side effects, while it was difficult to achieve with photothermal or photoacoustic therapy. These discoveries implied the potential application of TA therapy in deep-seated tumor models and should be further tested for development into a promising therapeutic modality for cancer treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e8","authors":["Wen, Liewei","Ding, Wenzheng","Yang, Sihua","Xing, Da"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biomaterials.2015.10.028","first_seen_on":"2015-11-05T05:32:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-5905","01429612"],"journal":"Biomaterials","last_mentioned_on":1454093840,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26513410?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0142961215008327"],"pmid":"26513410","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Microwave pumped high-efficient thermoacoustic tumor therapy with single wall carbon nanotubes ","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microwave-pumped-highefficient-thermoacoustic-tumor-therapy-single-wall-carbon-nanotubes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060796,"mean":6.2779102203052,"rank":3515888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2033494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060796,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238820,"mean":9.4934780147308,"rank":122860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":91465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238820,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2135,"mean":5.3955623242737,"rank":928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2135,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":8.7571898734177,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
