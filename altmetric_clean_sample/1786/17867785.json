Based on the doctor's suspicion before the vEEG, the PNEs were divided into two groups that included PNEs suspected as epileptic seizures and PNEs suspected as PNEs. PNEs in the former group were classified based on the suspected seizure type.\nOf 886 habitual paroxysmal events, vEEG confirmed that 83 events (68 children) were PNEs. The median age of the 68 children was 3.2 years. Concurrent epilepsies included focal epilepsies (n=33), infantile spasms (n=16), and other types (n=19). The most common types of PNEs were sleep myoclonus (n=11), followed by stereotypies (n=9), awake myoclonus (n=8), paroxysmal ocular deviations (PODs, n=8), and tonic posturing (n=8). Even after direct observation or video viewing, the doctors suspected epileptic seizures in all three of the PODs and two of the tonic posturing children. Before the vEEG, however, the accurate visual information led to the speculation that the four psychogenic and two sleep myoclonus events were all PNEs. Myoclonus, stereotypies, and head drops were often misdiagnosed as epileptic spasms, while PODs and tonic posturing were often misdiagnosed as focal seizures with motor components. Additionally, staring and motion arrest during a drowsy state were often misdiagnosed as focal dyscognitive seizures. Seven of eight patients with PODs had epileptic spasms that were concurrent with epileptic seizures. A diffuse cerebral lesion or reduced visual acuity was seen in seven patients with PODs.\nWe re-emphasize that vEEG is essential for accurate diagnosis and provides evidence for listing POD in the differential diagnosis of oculomotor paroxysmal events.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f7","authors":["Yuji Ito","Hiroyuki Kidokoro","Tamiko Negoro","Masaharu Tanaka","Yu Okai","Yoko Sakaguchi","Chikako Ogawa","Tomoya Takeuchi","Atsuko Ohno","Hiroyuki Yamamoto","Tomohiko Nakata","Satoshi Maesawa","Kazuyoshi Watanabe","Yoshiyuki Takahashi","Jun Natsume"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.eplepsyres.2017.02.009","first_seen_on":"2017-03-21T16:55:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09201211","1872-6844"],"journal":"Epilepsy Research","last_mentioned_on":1490516434,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28315806\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28315806"],"pmid":"28315806","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"Paroxysmal nonepileptic events in children with epilepsy","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0920121117300128","volume":"132","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paroxysmal-nonepileptic-events-children-epilepsy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":4467403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3922613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248751,"mean":13.364064217085,"rank":139677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":107651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248751,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":799,"mean":2.3478546365915,"rank":389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":799,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":4.135,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
