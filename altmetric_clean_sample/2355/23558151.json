Recent adaptations of reactions such as Huisgen 1,3-dipolar or Diels-Alder cycloadditions have enabled the labeling of specific residues in biomolecules by the attachment of molecules carrying azides, alkynes, or strained alkenes. Although these are fundamental tools, there is a need for the discovery of reactions that can label native proteins. We now report on the adaptation of the Paal-Knorr reaction to label lysine-residues in proteins via pyrrole linkages.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd9","authors":["Dasari, Ramesh","La\u2005Clair, James J.","Kornienko, Alexander"],"doi":"10.1002\/cbic.201700210","first_seen_on":"2017-08-10T12:17:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-4227","1439-7633"],"journal":"ChemBioChem","last_mentioned_on":1502406937,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cbic.201700210","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/cbic.201700210?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201700210\/pdf","pmid":"28715110","pubdate":"2017-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Irreversible protein labeling via Paal-Knorr conjugation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/irreversible-protein-labeling-paalknorr-conjugation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":2,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":3625266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4607584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179847,"mean":12.476050065056,"rank":71288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":105386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179847,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2078,"mean":2.5184005777564,"rank":457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2078,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":2.7166666666667,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
