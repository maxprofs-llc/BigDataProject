Individuals were categorized into three groups: no history of knee injury requiring surgery (33 Males, 24 Females, 54.53\u00b15.95years), history of knee surgery in college with no diagnosis of OA later in life (4 Males, 6 Females, 51.26\u00b17.29years), and history of knee surgery in college with physician diagnosed OA later in life (23 Males, 10 Females, 54.21\u00b17.64years). All individuals completed the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and SF-36v2.\nScores on the KOOS and SF-36v2.\nA majority (76.7%) of individuals who had a knee surgery in college did develop OA. The largest differences were on the KOOS scales between the healthy knee and surgical knee\/OA groups with the surgical knee\/OA group scoring worse on the KOOS. The largest mean differences between those groups were seen on the KOOS-quality of life scale (mean difference: 49.76; \u03a7(2)(3)=44.65; p=0.0001) and KOOS-sports scale (mean difference: 43.69; \u03a7 (2) (3)=28.69; p=0.0001. Additionally, scores on the SF-36v2 physical component scale was significantly worse for the surgical knee surgery\/knee OA group, compared to the healthy knee group and the surgical knee only group (p<0.007).\nLater in life functional limitations were observed in individuals who sustained a knee injury requiring surgery and developed OA. These findings support increased efforts toward prevention of knee injuries and consideration of the long-term implication when making treatment and return to activity decisions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f37","authors":["Simon, Janet E.","Grooms, Dustin R.","Docherty, Carrie L."],"doi":"10.1123\/jsr.2017-0115","first_seen_on":"2017-08-10T08:02:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1056-6716","1543-3072"],"journal":"Journal of Sport Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1505822237,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28787229","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28787229?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1123\/jsr.2017-0115"],"pmid":"28787229","pubdate":"2017-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Human Kinetics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","sportsmedicine"],"title":"The Long Term Impact of Osteoarthritis Following Knee Surgery in Former Collegiate Athletes","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.39,"score_history":{"1y":12.39,"6m":12.39,"3m":12.39,"1m":9.29,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.39},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8436356,"mean":7.0937825748122,"rank":706671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7729657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8436356,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219720,"mean":12.632677274155,"rank":29286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":190433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219720,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299,"mean":5.3737651006711,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.2416666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PhysioMeScience\/statuses\/895555828119240705","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23553903],"posted_on":"2017-08-10T08:02:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Physio Meets Science","url":"http:\/\/www.physiomeetsscience.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/769237060871983105\/pMkvPtJ5_normal.jpg","description":"critical therapists in the field of physiotherapy, pain and movement science","id_on_source":"PhysioMeScience","tweeter_id":"769235186160640001","geo":{"lt":49.40768,"ln":8.69079,"country":"DE"},"followers":2759},"tweet_id":"895555828119240705"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InfoPhysioPT\/statuses\/895617960529850369","license":"gnip","rt":["PhysioMeScience"],"citation_ids":[23553903],"posted_on":"2017-08-10T12:08:56+00:00","author":{"name":"InfoPhysiotherapy","url":"http:\/\/www.infophysiotherapy.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/889264532136308737\/AM8V0DpT_normal.jpg","description":"Anthony Teoli MScPT, physiotherapist.
