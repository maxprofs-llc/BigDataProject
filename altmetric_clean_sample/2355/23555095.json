Between 2007 and 2010, 527 samples were obtained from 17 cantons. Between 2011 and 2014, 159 samples were collected from the canton Berne. The most frequent toxins detected were deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA) and nivalenol (NIV). The overall mean DON content in all samples was 607 \u00b5g\/kg, and 11% exceeded the European limit for unprocessed cereals for foodstuffs (1250 \u00b5g\/kg). For ZEA (mean 39 \u00b5g\/kg), 7% exceeded the respective limit (100 \u00b5g\/kg), and the mean content of NIV (no limit established) was 15 \u00b5g\/kg. Between the years, the ratio of mycotoxin-contaminated samples ranged between 52% and 98% for DON, 9% and 43% for ZEA and 0% and 49% for NIV. The yearly mean contents varied substantially between 68 and 1310 \u00b5g\/kg for DON, 5 and 56 \u00b5g\/kg for ZEA and 6 and 29 \u00b5g\/kg for NIV. The geographic origin showed a significant effect on DON and ZEA contamination, but was inconsistent between the years. This study has shown that the majority of Swiss-produced wheat is, in terms of Fusarium toxins, fit for human consumption and feed purposes. Nevertheless, depending on the year, high toxin contents can be expected, an issue that growers, cereal collection centres and the food industry have to deal with to ensure food and feed safety.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5373cf058f610004677","authors":["Susanne Vogelgsang","Tomke Musa","Irene B\u00e4nziger","Andreas K\u00e4gi","Thomas Bucheli","Felix Wettstein","Matias Pasquali","Hans-Rudolf Forrer","Vogelgsang, Susanne","Musa, Tomke","B\u00e4nziger, Irene","K\u00e4gi, Andreas","Bucheli, Thomas","Wettstein, Felix","Pasquali, Matias","Forrer, Hans-Rudolf"],"doi":"10.3390\/toxins9080246","first_seen_on":"2017-08-10T09:34:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2072-6651"],"issue":"8","journal":"Toxins","last_mentioned_on":1502368776,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6651\/9\/8\/246","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28792467?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6651\/9\/8\/246\/pdf","pmid":"28792467","pubdate":"2017-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Fusarium Mycotoxins in Swiss Wheat: A Survey of Growers\u2019 Samples between 2007 and 2014 Shows Strong Year and Minor Geographic Effects","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fusarium-mycotoxins-swiss-wheat-survey-growers-samples-between-2007-2014-shows-strong-year-minor-geo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":6039360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2014409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179842,"mean":12.476410829566,"rank":116388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":52856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179842,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":913,"mean":5.0505065789474,"rank":491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":913,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":4.9052631578947,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Toxins_Mdpi\/statuses\/895575245762871296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23555095],"posted_on":"2017-08-10T09:19:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Toxins-Mdpi","url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/journal\/toxins","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848822926862426112\/yxny3LPd_normal.jpg","description":"A flagship open access, peer-reviewed journal published by MDPI AG.
