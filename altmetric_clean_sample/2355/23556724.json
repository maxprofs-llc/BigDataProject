CV injury indicators may be useful to investigate the dialysis modality influence on survival.\nThe aim of this study was to compare selected laboratory and echocardiographic (ECHO) markers of CV injury in terms of dialysis vintage (DV), CV-related mortality and all-cause mortality.\nThe study involved 301 patients on HD (n = 301) and PD (n = 58), who were divided into subgroups according to DV. The subjects' medical histories included diabetes mellitus (DM), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, CV deaths and deaths from non-CV causes. Their CV parameters were measured with ECHO for the left ventricle ejection fraction (EF), posterior wall (LVW) and interventricular septum (IVS). Serum analyses of cardiac troponin T (TnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were also carried out.\nIn the subgroup with a DV of 4 years, the PD and HD patients were of a similar age, and had similar mortality and morbidity rates and CV markers, except for thicker IVS in the HD patients.\nFocusing on the data analysis based on mortality, and both laboratory and echocardiographic markers of cardiovascular injury, PD seems to be a more favorable method of dialysis. The advantage of PD was noted in subjects with a DV < 2 years. HD showed no outcome benefit over PD in longer DV.","authors":["Hoppe, Krzysztof","Schwermer, Krzysztof","Olewicz-Gawlik, Anna","Klysz, Patrycja","Kawka, Anna","Baum, Ewa","Sikorska, Dorota","\u015acigacz, Katarzyna","Roszak, Magdalena","Lindholm, Bengt","Pawlaczyk, Krzysztof","Oko, Andrzej"],"first_seen_on":"2017-08-10T10:54:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1899-5276"],"issue":"2","journal":"Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University","last_mentioned_on":1502362447,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28791842?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28791842","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Dialysis vintage and cardiovascular injury as factors influencing long-term survival in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis.","type":"article","volume":"26"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/troponinpapers\/statuses\/895599135507660800","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23556724],"posted_on":"2017-08-10T10:54:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Troponin_papers","url":"http:\/\/www.highsteacs.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/658230994202468352\/J1L9QKml_normal.png","description":"Twitter-bot from @highSTEACS searches PubMed for latest #troponin #research","id_on_source":"troponinpapers","tweeter_id":"4038106461","geo":{"lt":55.95206,"ln":-3.19648,"country":"GB"},"followers":255},"tweet_id":"895599135507660800"}]}}
