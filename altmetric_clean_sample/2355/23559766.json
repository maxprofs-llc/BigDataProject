The maximal aerobic capacity, as well as the endurance capacity, was improved by 10% (p less than 0.05). The intramuscular glycogen store increased by more than 80% (p less than 0.05) from 350 mumol\/g dw (dry weight), and the activities of citrate synthase and 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase increased by more than 50% (p less than 0.05) and 30% (p less than 0.05). The activity of glycogen synthase was decreased by approximately 20% (p less than 0.05), whereas lactate dehydrogenase remained unchanged. Capillaries\/fibre and fibre area increased by more than 50% (p less than 0.05) and 30% (p less than 0.05) leaving the area of supply constant. Training did not influence fasting blood lipids and glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, oral glucose tolerance, and insulin response to an oral glucose load measured 72 hours post-exercise. It is concluded that patients with manifest type II diabetes, as normoglycaemic individuals, adapt to physical training. However, no persistent effect on glucohomeostasis and lipaemia is produced by short-term training in the diabetic patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ec3cf058f610005d5b","authors":["Allenberg, K","Johansen, K","Saltin, B"],"first_seen_on":"2017-08-10T13:14:01+00:00","issns":["0001-6101"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1502370827,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3369317"],"pmid":"3369317","pubdate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Skeletal muscle adaptations to physical training in type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.","type":"article","volume":"223","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/skeletal-muscle-adaptations-physical-training-type-ii-noninsulindependent-diabetes-mellitus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":6338027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1132130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179843,"mean":12.476332280557,"rank":126987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179843,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1254,"mean":7.7179632881085,"rank":1050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1254,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.3066666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/metapredict\/statuses\/895634283548647426","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23559766],"posted_on":"2017-08-10T13:13:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Jamie_Timmons","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/816223648352714752\/7pqixPXZ_normal.jpg","description":"Scientist, Dad, Glaswegian, Surviving_depression_46yr_and_counting http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2255-1220.
