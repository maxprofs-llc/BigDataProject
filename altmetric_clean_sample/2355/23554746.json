Endovascular and medical physicians were asked to rate their predilection for catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) on a 5-point scale and for systemic thrombolysis (ST) as \"yes\" or \"no\" in seven case scenarios of submassive PE. A CDT score \u2265 4 was considered to represent a predilection for CDT. Mean scores were used to compare CDT preferences between physicians. Percentages of physicians who preferred CDT or ST were calculated. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.\nAcross all scenarios (numbered S1-S7) combined, endovascular physicians had a significantly higher CDT score (mean, 3.52) than medical physicians (mean, 3.01; P < .0001). Scenario-by-scenario analysis revealed that the mean CDT score was significantly higher for endovascular physicians (S1, 4.25; S2, 3.72; S3, 2.82; S4, 2.68; S5, 3.45; S6, 3.67; S7, 4.02) compared with medical physicians (S1, 3.62 [P < .001]; S2, 3.18 [P < .001]; S3, 2.45 [P\u00a0= .001]; S4, 2.37 [P\u00a0= .011]; S5, 2.97 [P < .001]; S6, 3.20 [P < .001]; S7, 3.53 [P < .001]). Overall, a significantly higher percentage of endovascular physicians (56.7%) indicated a predilection for CDT compared with medical physicians (37.9%; P < .001). Also, a significantly higher percentage of physicians, regardless of specialty, indicated a predilection for CDT (47.2%) than did for ST (5.3%; P < .0001).\nEndovascular physicians exhibited a greater predilection for CDT to treat acute submassive PE compared with their medical colleagues. Endovascular and medical physicians seemed to more frequently choose CDT than ST.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f16","authors":["Bedros Taslakian","Daanish Chawala","Akhilesh K.
