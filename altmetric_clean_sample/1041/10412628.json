The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of an ultrasound-guided continuous PV catheter catheter infusion for postoperative pain control with single-shot intercostal blocks (ICB).\nA prospective, randomized, controlled trial.\nAn academic university hospital.\nPatients (\u226518 years of age) who underwent a VATS procedure.\nPatients were randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 received single-shot ICB. Group 2 received an ultrasound-guided PV catheter with a continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine.\nThere were 25 patients in group 1 and 23 patients in group 2. The maximum pain score was significantly lower in the group that received the PV catheter compared with those who received ICB during 24 to 48 hours (3.65 v 6.44, p<0.001). Seventeen patients (74%) who received PV catheters reported satisfaction with a pain control regimen compared to the 11 (44%) who received ICB (p = 0.036). In addition, during 24 to 48 hours after surgery the mean opioid use decreased significantly in the PV catheter group (14.39 v 30.50 mg morphine equivalents, p = 0.046).\nUltrasound-guided continuous PV catheter infusions provided prolonged pain control and superior patient satisfaction compared with single-shot ICB after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb4","authors":["Jacob Hutchins","Jeremy Sanchez","Rafael Andrade","Eitan Podgaetz","Qi Wang","Robby Sikka"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.jvca.2016.08.010","first_seen_on":"2016-08-11T17:51:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10530770","1532-8422"],"journal":"Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1470937877,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1053077016303469&_version=1&md5=753d65ecd742aa36a0ef49ff3a5c7045"],"pmid":"27810407","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Ultrasound-Guided Paravertebral Catheter Versus Intercostal Blocks for Post-Operative Pain Control in Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery: A Prospective Randomized Trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrasoundguided-paravertebral-catheter-versus-intercostal-blocks-postoperative-pain-control-videoas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":7096926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257426,"mean":11.976543933184,"rank":217245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257426,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1013,"mean":0.92441501976285,"rank":418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1013,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.90666666666667,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
