Alternative approaches under investigation to combat the anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria include fecal transplantation therapy, vaccines, and antibody-based immunotherapies. In this review, we catalog the recent advances in antibody-based approaches under development and in the clinic for the treatment of C. difficile infection. By and large, inhibitory antibodies that recognize the primary C. difficile virulence factors, toxin A and toxin B, are the most popular passive immunotherapies under investigation. We provide a detailed summary of the toxin epitopes recognized by various antitoxin antibodies and discuss general trends on toxin inhibition efficacy. In addition, antibodies to other C. difficile targets, such as surface-layer proteins, binary toxin, motility factors, and adherence and colonization factors, are introduced in this review.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ef2","authors":["Jamshid Tanha","Greg Hussack","Hussack, Greg","Tanha, Jamshid"],"doi":"10.2147\/ceg.s84017","endpage":"224","first_seen_on":"2016-08-11T19:47:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-7023"],"journal":"Clinical and Experimental Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1471832271,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/an-update-on-antibody-based-immunotherapies-for-clostridium-difficile--peer-reviewed-article-CEG","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27536153?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=31666","pmid":"27536153","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"209","title":"An update on antibody-based immunotherapies for <em>Clostridium difficile<\/em> infection","type":"article","volume":"Volume 9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/update-antibodybased-immunotherapies-clostridium-difficile-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":3361030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4841425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258371,"mean":11.971930247319,"rank":94099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":162035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258371,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":8.3755572519084,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.5833333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
