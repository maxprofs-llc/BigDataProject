Patients with primary lung cancer in any phase of survivorship were included. Demographic data and treatment details were collected from the medical charts of participants. The unmet needs were determined overall and by domain. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed to determine factors associated with greater unmet needs.\nFrom August 2013 to February 2014, 89 patients [44 (49%) men; median age: 71 years (range: 44-89 years)] were recruited. The mean number of unmet needs was 8 (range: 0-34), and 69 patients (78%) reported at least 1 unmet need. The need proportions by domain were 52% health system and information, 66% psychological, 58% physical, 24% patient care, and 20% sexuality. The top 2 unmet needs were \"fears of the cancer spreading\" [n = 44 of 84 (52%)] and \"lack of energy\/tiredness\" [n = 42 of 88 (48%)]. On multivariable analysis, more advanced disease and higher MD Anderson Symptom Inventory scores were associated with increased unmet needs. Patients reported that the most desired information needs were those for information on managing symptoms such as fatigue (78%), shortness of breath (77%), and cough (63%).\nUnmet supportive care needs are common in lung cancer patients, with some patients experiencing a very high number of unmet needs. Further work is needed to develop resources to address those needs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003b40","authors":["M.E. Giuliani","R.A. Milne","M. Puts","L.R. Sampson","J.Y.Y. Kwan","L.W.
