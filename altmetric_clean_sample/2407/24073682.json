Inactive-uPA is subject to proteolytic cleavage which results in the two-chain active protein. uPA plays key roles in the enhancement of cell malignancy during tumor progression. uPA is finely regulated in normal cells, but dysregulated in tumor cells, which results in increased cellular invasion capacities reflecting changes in uPA activity and expression during tumor progression. In this review we will discuss the main aspects of uPA, from its capacity to activate plasminogen to plasmin, to the main intracellular signal transduction mechanisms as well as the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of uPA expression, including regulation by microRNAs. Finally, the current therapeutic methodologies targeting uPA for cancer treatment are described.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033c9","authors":["Santibanez, Juan Francisco"],"doi":"10.2174\/0929866524666170818161132","first_seen_on":"2017-08-19T13:38:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1875-5305"],"journal":"Protein & Peptide Letters","last_mentioned_on":1503160985,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28820062?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28820062","pubdate":"2017-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Urokinase type plasminogen activator and the molecular mechanisms of its regulation in cancer.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":6372382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1138891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165898,"mean":12.816522782208,"rank":117737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":29938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165898,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":1.6612155172414,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/898901902481436672","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24073682],"posted_on":"2017-08-19T13:38:08+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
