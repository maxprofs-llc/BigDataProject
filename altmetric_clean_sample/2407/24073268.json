Based on two solution-processable dropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diylidene)bis(thieno[3,2-b]thiophene derivatives with aromatic and quinoid structures, we have carried out a systematic study of the relationship between the conjugated-backbone structure and the thermoelectric properties. In particular, a combination of UV-vis-NIR spectra, photoemission spectroscopy and doping optimization are utilized to probe the interplay between energy levels, chemical doping, and thermoelectric performance. We found that a moderate change in the conjugated backbone leads to varied doping mechanism, and contributes to dramatic changes in the thermoelectric performance. Notably, the chemically doped A-DCV-DPPTT, a small molecule with aromatic structure, exhibits an electrical conductivity of 5.3 S cm-1 and a high power factor (PF373K) up to 236 \u00b5W m-1 K-2, which is 50 times higher than that of Q-DCM-DPPTT with quinoid structure. More importantly, the low thermal conductivity enables A-DCV-DPPTT to possess a figure of merit (ZT) of 0.23\u00b10.03, which is the highest value reported to date for thermoelectric materials based on organic small molecules. These results demonstrate that the modulation of the conjugated backbone represents a powerful strategy for tuning the electronic structure and mobility of organic semiconductors towards a maximum thermoelectric performance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Dazhen Huang","Huiying Yao","Yutao Cui","Ye Zou","Fengjiao Zhang","Chao Wang","Hongguang Shen","Wenlong Jin","Jia Zhu","Ying Diao","Wei Xu","Chong-an Di","Daoben Zhu"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.7b05344","first_seen_on":"2017-08-19T13:22:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1503341617,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28820584?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28820584","pubdate":"2017-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Conjugated Backbone Effect of Organic Small Molecules for n-Type Thermoelectric Materials with ZT over 0.2","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conjugatedbackbone-effect-organic-small-molecules-ntype-thermoelectric-materials-zt-02"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":3994278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4228550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172528,"mean":12.774605621149,"rank":78487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":88681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172528,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19312,"mean":5.3114537828181,"rank":12132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19312,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218,"mean":9.3235207373272,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
