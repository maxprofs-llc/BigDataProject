We also carried out a serum targeted metabolite profiling to the glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and Krebs cycle (n = 48) and an exploration by the next-generation sequencing of aminotransferase genes (n = 96). An in vitro study to provide a biological explanation of changes in the transcriptional level and enzymatic activity of aminotransferases was included.\nFatty liver was associated with a deregulated liver expression of aminotransferases, which was unrelated to the disease severity. Metabolite profiling showed that serum aminotransferase concentrations are a signature of liver metabolic perturbations, particularly at the amino acid metabolism and Krebs cycle level. A significant and positive association between systolic hypertension and liver expression levels of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2) messenger RNA (Spearman R = 0.42, P = 0.03) was observed. The rs6993 located in the 3' untranslated region of the GOT2 locus was significantly associated with features of the MetS, including arterial hypertension [P = 0.028; OR: 2.285 (95% CI: 1.024, 5.09); adjusted by NAFLD severity] and plasma lipid concentrations.\nIn the context of an abnormal hepatic triglyceride accumulation, circulating aminotransferases rise as a consequence of the need for increased reactions of transamination to cope with the liver metabolic derangement that is associated with greater gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance. Hence, to maintain homeostasis, the liver upregulates these enzymes, leading to changes in the amounts of amino acids released into the circulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["Sookoian, Silvia","Casta\u00f1o, Gustavo O","Scian, Romina","Fern\u00e1ndez Gianotti, Tomas","Dopazo, Hern\u00e1n","Rohr, Cristian","Gaj, Graciela","San Martino, Julio","Sevic, Ina","Flichman, Diego","Pirola, Carlos J"],"doi":"10.3945\/ajcn.115.118695","first_seen_on":"2016-01-23T13:06:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-3207"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1465907252,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26791191?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26791191","pubdate":"2016-01-23T22:02:44+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Serum aminotransferases in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are a signature of liver metabolic perturbations at the amino acid and Krebs cycle level.","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-aminotransferases-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-signature-liver-metabolic-perturbations-ami"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7896890,"mean":6.6848881279648,"rank":6837667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7896890,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":328371,"mean":9.370634515942,"rank":276562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":328371,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5833,"mean":25.228095679012,"rank":5472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5833,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":58.432629032258,"rank":120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
