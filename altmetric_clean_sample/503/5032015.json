Comparisons of the behavioral efficacy of NF and medication have produced inconsistent results. EEG measures can provide insight into treatment mechanisms, but have received little consideration. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), effects of NF were compared with methylphenidate (MPH), and physical activity (PA) in children with ADHD on event-related potential (ERP) indices of response inhibition, which are involved in ADHD psychopathology.\nUsing a multicenter three way parallel group RCT design, 112 children with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV) diagnosis of ADHD, between 7 and 13 years of age, were initially included. NF training consisted of 30 sessions of theta\/beta training at Cz over a 10 week period. PA training was a semiactive control group, matched in frequency and duration. MPH was titrated using a double-blind placebo controlled procedure in 6 weeks, followed by a stable dose for 4 weeks. ERP measures of response inhibition, N2 and P3, were available for 81 children at pre- and postintervention (n\u2009=\u200932 NF, n\u2009=\u200925 MPH, n\u2009=\u200924 PA).\nOnly the medication group showed a specific increase in P3 amplitude compared with NF (partial eta-squared [\u03b7p(2) ]\u2009=\u20090.121) and PA (\u03b7p(2)\u2009=\u20090.283), which was related to improved response inhibition. Source localization of medication effects on P3 amplitude indicated increased activation primarily in thalamic and striatal nuclei.\nThis is the first study that simultaneously compared NF with stimulant treatment and a semiactive control group. Only stimulant treatment demonstrated specific improvements in brain function related to response inhibition. These results are in line with recent doubts on the efficacy and specificity of NF as treatment for ADHD.\nTrain Your Brain?
