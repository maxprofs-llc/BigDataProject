Sorafenib became the first drug approved for this indication in more than two decades after a significant improvement in the progression-free survival was demonstrated. Lenvatinib (E-7080), an orally active inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2 and 3, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret and mast\/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit, yielded highly promising early clinical data, even when given after progression on first-line therapy. The phase III SELECT trial recently demonstrated the impressive clinical activity of the drug in RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, leading to the drug's approval by the regulatory agencies and potentially making lenvatinib the most effective drug available to date for the treatment of the disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6153cf058f610007182","authors":["Hegazi, M","Azadi, A","Jain, D","Redman, R","Perez, C A"],"doi":"10.1358\/dot.2015.51.12.2420390","first_seen_on":"2016-01-24T05:49:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1699-3993"],"issue":"12","journal":"Drugs of Today = Medicamentos de actualidad","last_mentioned_on":1453614564,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26798849?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26798849","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Pharmacological and clinical profile of lenvatinib (E-7080) in the treatment of advanced, radioiodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacological-clinical-profile-lenvatinib-e7080-treatment-advanced-radioiodinerefractory-different"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7017937,"mean":6.2626215194869,"rank":2761482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4153349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7017937,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317599,"mean":9.2095686307846,"rank":118405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":193405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317599,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":2.3350967741935,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.55,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Athomewithtia\/statuses\/691135669490454530","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5032377],"posted_on":"2016-01-24T05:49:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Athomewithtia \u2764\ufe0f","url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/AtHomeWithTia","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/696111146068107264\/yK6FJdY__normal.jpg","description":"\u2764\ufe0fPositive attitude = positive life\u2764\ufe0f.
