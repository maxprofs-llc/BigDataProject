Given low rates of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction (MI) for\u00a0current drug-eluting stents, we examined outcomes among EES-treated subjects in the DAPT study.\nThe DAPT study enrolled 25,682 subjects (11,308 EES-treated) after coronary stenting. Following 12 months of treatment with thienopyridine and aspirin, eligible subjects continued treatment with aspirin and 9,961 (4,703 with EES) were randomized to 18 months of continued thienopyridine or placebo. Stent type was not randomized, and the EES\u00a0subset analysis was post hoc.\nAmong EES-treated patients, continued thienopyridine reduced stent thrombosis (0.3% vs. 0.7%, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15 to 0.97; p\u00a0= 0.04) and MI (2.1% vs. 3.2%, HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.91; p\u00a0= 0.01) versus placebo but did not reduce a composite of death, MI, and stroke (4.3% vs. 4.5%, HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.18; p\u00a0= 0.42), and increased moderate\/severe bleeding (2.5% vs. 1.3%, HR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.80; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and death (2.2% vs. 1.1%, HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.92; p\u00a0= 0.02). Death due to cancer and not related to bleeding was\u00a0increased (0.64% vs. 0.17%; p\u00a0= 0.01).\nIn EES-treated subjects, significant reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and an increase in bleeding were observed with continued thienopyridine beyond 1 year compared with aspirin alone.
