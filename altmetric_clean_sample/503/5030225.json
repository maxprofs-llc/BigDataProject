This study used chitosan (CS)\/fucoidan (F) nanoparticles (NPs) to develop a nanoformulation for pulmonary delivery of GM, presenting a biphasic release feature. The NPs exhibited a zero-order release of GM for the first 10h, followed by a sustained release of up to 72h, attaining a value of 99%. The GM-loaded CS\/F NPs provide multiple antimicrobial capabilities against Klebsiella pneumoniae, including the CS and biphasic release of GM. Compared with the intravenous administration of free GM (0.5mg\/kg), the intratracheal administration of GM-loaded CS\/F NP (0.27mg\/kg) presented a superior area under the concentration-time curve\/minimum inhibitory concentration ratio, indicating the simultaneous improvement of antimicrobial efficacy and elimination of systemic toxicity. These results suggested that CS\/F NPs are potential carriers in pulmonary delivery of GM for pneumonia treatment.","authors":["Huang, Yi-Cheng","Li, Rou-Ying","Chen, Jiun-Yu","Chen, Jen-Kun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.carbpol.2015.11.072","first_seen_on":"2016-01-23T11:15:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1344"],"journal":"Carbohydrate polymers","last_mentioned_on":1453547706,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26794744?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26794744","pubdate":"2016-01-23T22:01:41+00:00","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Biphasic release of gentamicin from chitosan\/fucoidan nanoparticles for pulmonary delivery.","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biphasic-release-gentamicin-chitosanfucoidan-nanoparticles-pulmonary-delivery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":5,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Student  > Ph.
