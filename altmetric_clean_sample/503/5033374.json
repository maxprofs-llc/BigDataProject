Microalgal cells, characterized by high photosynthetic efficiency and rapid cell division, are an excellent source of neutral lipids as potential fuel stocks. Various stress factors, especially nutrient-starvation conditions, induce an increased formation of lipid bodies filled with triacylglycerol in these cells. Here we review our knowledge base on glycerolipid synthesis in the green algae with an emphasis on recent studies on carbon flux, redistribution of lipids under nutrient-limiting conditions and its regulation. We discuss the contributions and limitations of classical and novel approaches used to elucidate the algal triacylglycerol biosynthetic pathway and its regulatory network in green algae. Also discussed are gaps in knowledge and suggestions for much needed research both on the biology of triacylglycerol accumulation and possible avenues to engineer improved algal strains.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003333","authors":["Goncalves, Elton C","Wilkie, Ann C","Kirst, Matias","Rathinasabapathi, Bala","Goncalves, Elton C.","Wilkie, Ann C."],"doi":"10.1111\/pbi.12523","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-01-24T14:06:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1467-7652"],"issue":"8","journal":"Plant Biotechnology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1470855742,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26801206?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/pbi.12523","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pbi.12523\/pdf?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pbi.12523\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/pbi.12523#.V3-E9U-hN5k.twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26801206"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pbi.12523\/pdf","pmid":"26801206","pubdate":"2016-01-24T22:00:47+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["biotechnology","botany"],"title":"Metabolic regulation of triacylglycerol accumulation in the green algae: identification of potential targets for engineering to improve oil yield","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-regulation-triacylglycerol-accumulation-green-algae-identification-potential-targets-engin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.65,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8192854,"mean":6.9262032168704,"rank":534434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7657990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8192854,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331885,"mean":9.5092896915786,"rank":28823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":303029,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331885,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":723,"mean":8.4716426592798,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":723,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":9.27992,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
