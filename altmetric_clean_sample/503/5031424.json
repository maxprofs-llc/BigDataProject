The results showed SE infection reduced growth performance,and increased salmonella cecal colonization and internal organs invasion, increased concentration of intestinal specific IgA and serum specific IgG antibody, as compared to uninfected birds. SE challenge differentially regulated AvBDs, Caths and LEAP-2 gene expression in the jejunum and spleen of broiler chickens during the infection period. However, YG supplementation inhibited the growth depression by SE challenge, and further increased level of serum specific IgG and intestinal specific IgA antibody. Higher level of salmonella colonization and internal organs invasion in the SE-infected birds were reduced by YG. SE-induced differentially expression patterns of AMPs genes was inhibited or changed by YG. Results indicated YG enhance chicken's resistance to Salmonella infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b27","authors":["Shao, Yujing","Wang, Zhong","Tian, Xiangyu","Guo, Yuming","Zhang, Haibo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijbiomac.2016.01.031","first_seen_on":"2016-01-23T16:44:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0003"],"journal":"International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","last_mentioned_on":1453567468,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26794312?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26794312","pubdate":"2016-01-23T22:01:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Yeast \u03b2-D-glucans induced antimicrobial peptide expressions against Salmonella infection in broiler chickens.","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/yeast-%CE%B2dglucans-induced-antimicrobial-peptide-expressions-against-salmonella-infection-broiler-chick"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7012411,"mean":6.2597681384832,"rank":5244212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7012411,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317437,"mean":9.205551922277,"rank":218232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":56753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317437,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":652,"mean":1.4595821812596,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":652,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":1.0146153846154,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
