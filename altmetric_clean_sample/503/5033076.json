Chemical genomic profiling was performed, showing no yeast response differences in hydrolysates produced during RaBIT enzymatic hydrolysis. Concentrations of degradation products in solution were quantified after different enzymatic hydrolysis cycles and fermentation cycles. Intracellular degradation product concentrations were also measured following fermentation. Degradation product concentrations in hydrolysate did not change between RaBIT enzymatic hydrolysis cycles; the cell population retained its ability to oxidize\/reduce (detoxify) aldehydes over five RaBIT fermentation cycles; and degradation products accumulated within or on the cells as RaBIT fermentation cycles increased. Synthetic hydrolysate was used to confirm that pretreatment degradation products are the sole cause of decreased xylose consumption during RaBIT fermentations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Sarks, Cory","Higbee, Alan","Piotrowski, Jeff","Xue, Saisi","Coon, Joshua J","Sato, Trey K","Jin, Mingjie","Balan, Venkatesh","Dale, Bruce E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2016.01.008","first_seen_on":"2016-01-24T11:44:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2976"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1453635851,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26802184?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26802184","pubdate":"2016-01-24T22:00:27+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Quantifying pretreatment degradation compounds in solution and accumulated by cells during solids and yeast recycling in the Rapid Bioconversion with Integrated recycling Technology process using AFEX\u2122 corn stover.","type":"article","volume":"205","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantifying-pretreatment-degradation-compounds-solution-accumulated-cells-during-solids-yeast-recycl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7017937,"mean":6.2626215194869,"rank":5249014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7017937,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317598,"mean":9.2096606013278,"rank":218367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":56686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317598,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1651,"mean":2.0927175757576,"rank":883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1651,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":1.5633018867925,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
