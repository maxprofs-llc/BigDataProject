The diversity of routinely recorded emission spectra does underpin the strength of the single-molecule approach in resolving the heterogeneity and dynamics, otherwise hidden in the ensemble. In early cryogenic studies single molecules were identified by their distinct excitation spectra, yet measuring excitation spectra at room temperature remains challenging. Here we present a broadband Fourier approach that allows rapid recording of excitation spectra of individual molecules under ambient conditions and that is robust against blinking and bleaching. Applying the method we show that the excitation spectra of individual molecules exhibit an extreme distribution of solvatochromic shifts and distinct spectral shapes. Importantly, we demonstrate that the sensitivity and speed of the broadband technique is comparable to that of emission spectroscopy putting both techniques side-by-side in single-molecule spectroscopy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Lukasz Piatkowski","Esther Gellings","Niek F. van Hulst","Piatkowski, Lukasz","Gellings, Esther","van Hulst, Niek F"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms10411","first_seen_on":"2016-01-23T16:25:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1733","2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1455828660,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2016\/160122\/ncomms10411\/full\/ncomms10411.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms10411.epdf?shared_access_token=JAw2fgvyA1-9UGce4Cm-Q9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PR6DeKW79evXxpe7sXBFH8ICjyAUtIDicuRNF_UjPiroX34BUR_ScJD7XAJ2UHB2Wh5xOyQVJncDQs2lx_s5wvhdIwPfaEsO67eLv80auFiUTvx9_qYkiS7GWmgD-7uCY%3D"],"pmid":"26794035","pubdate":"2016-01-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"10411","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Broadband single-molecule excitation spectroscopy","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/broadband-singlemolecule-excitation-spectroscopy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211484,"mean":6.3513465940328,"rank":5172682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1783408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211484,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319557,"mean":9.2755979484031,"rank":202367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":98446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319557,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10965,"mean":40.572756110908,"rank":9635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":1090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10965,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":707,"mean":54.494716713881,"rank":627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":707,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
