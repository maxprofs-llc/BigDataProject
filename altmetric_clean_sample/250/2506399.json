It manifests itself by ionic disorders where the sodium and chlorine level decrease with the simultaneous potassium retention. Synthesised aldosterone is in the glomerular zone of the adrenal cortex. Symptoms of dyselectrolitemia are not distinctive, they develop within a few first days of life. The suction aversion, apathy, lack of growth or progressing, body mass loss is being noticed. The most often cause of salt wasting syndrome is the congenital cortical adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) caused by 21-hydroxylase enzyme deficit. The classic form with and without salt wasting (SW), as well as non-classic form is distinguished. The therapy of SW form depends on Hydrocortisone and Cortineff administering. The other forms of salt wasting syndrome occur not so often and these are: aldosterone synthesis deficit, dehydrogenase 3beta-hydroxysteroid deficit, lipoid cortical hyperplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenital (AHC), adrenoleukodystrophy and pseudohypoaldosteronism. The knowledge of the symptoms and causes of salt wasting syndrome allows for the proper therapeutic management and contributes to the regular psychophysical infantile development of the children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fd3cf058f610006099","authors":["Basiak A","Wikiera B","Noczy\u0144ska A"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-14T01:08:23+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Endokrynologia, Diabetologia i Choroby Przemiany Materii Wieku Rozwojowego \/ Pediatric Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1405300087,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15996340"],"pmid":"15996340","pubdate":"2004-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology","pediatrics"],"title":"[Salt wasting syndrome caused by congenital, insufficient synthesis or aldosterone function--etiology, diagnosis and management].","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salt-wasting-syndrome-caused-congenital-insufficient-synthesis-aldosterone-functionetiology-diagnosi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4022308,"mean":5.0456959241201,"rank":2251253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1037547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4022308,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100817,"mean":7.8791204769084,"rank":53799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100817,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Arts and Humanities":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AcharyaS\/status\/488490086627942400","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2506399],"posted_on":"2014-07-14T01:08:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Religion and History","url":"http:\/\/TruthBeKnown.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/466369437205929984\/ftUzDsG2_normal.jpeg","description":"Acharya S\/DM Murdock writes about the history of religion & mythology, including 'The Christ Conspiracy,' 'Suns of God,' 'Christ in  Egypt' & 'Did Moses Exist?'","id_on_source":"AcharyaS","tweeter_id":"22455296","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":14931},"tweet_id":"488490086627942400"}]}}
