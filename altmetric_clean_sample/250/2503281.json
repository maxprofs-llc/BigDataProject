A 66 year old male was suffering from chronic endophthalmitis post-cataract surgery. Polymerase chain reaction examination on anterior chamber fluid was positive for Propionibacterium acnes but negative for the panfungal genome. He was advised vitrectomy with intravitreal injections. Polymerase chain reaction of vitreous aspirate was positive for P.acnes as well as panfungal genome. The vitreous sample also grew yeast in culture which was identified as Candida pseudotropicalis. Patient was treated on an alternate day regimen of intravitreal Vancomycin and Amphotericin B in the post-operative period. There was improvement in vision at final follow up. Chronic endophthalmitis can have polymicrobial etiology which will require appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The role of molecular testing is vital in these cases as growth in culture is often negative.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aac","authors":["A Mukherjee","S Pramanik","D Das","R Roy","K L Therese","Mukherjee","KL Therese"],"doi":"10.4103\/0255-0857.136593","first_seen_on":"2014-07-11T23:04:55+00:00","issns":["1998-3646","0255-0857"],"issue":"3","journal":"Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1502835991,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25008833?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4103\/0255-0857.136593"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijmm.org\/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2014;volume=32;issue=3;spage=331;epage=332;aulast=Mukherjee;type=2","pmid":"25008833","pubdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Polymicrobial chronic endophthalmitis diagnosed by culture and molecular technique.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymicrobial-chronic-endophthalmitis-diagnosed-culture-molecular-technique"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":2067528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6272876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180001,"mean":7.6602397333336,"rank":45669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":133397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180001,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":360,"mean":1.7194540389972,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":360,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.11475,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/status\/487734237626236928","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2503281],"posted_on":"2014-07-11T23:04:38+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
