Epigenetic modulation is emerging as an important mechanism for understanding how the implicated genes interact with environmental factors. We review recent progress toward identifying causative variants of SLE-associated loci and epigenetic impact on lupus, especially genetic-epigenetic interactions that modulate expression levels of SLE susceptibility genes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000586d","authors":["Yun Deng","Betty P Tsao"],"doi":"10.1097\/bor.0000000000000086","first_seen_on":"2014-07-11T20:09:01+00:00","funders":["niams"],"issns":["1531-6963"],"journal":"Current opinion in rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1405109253,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25010439?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25010439","pubdate":"2014-07-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Advances in lupus genetics and epigenetics.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/advances-lupus-genetics-epigenetics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4015364,"mean":5.0309291149418,"rank":3208310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":102424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4015364,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99989,"mean":7.8322552931882,"rank":79243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99989,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":427,"mean":2.0991126760563,"rank":379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":427,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.7595238095238,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
