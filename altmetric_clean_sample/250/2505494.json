Timely identifying the translation initiation site (TIS) is very important for conducting in-depth genome analysis. With the avalanche of genome sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired to develop automated methods for rapidly and effectively identification of TIS. Although some computational methods were proposed in this regard, none of them considered the global or long-range sequence-order effects of DNA, and hence their prediction quality was limited. To count this kind of effects, a new predictor, called \"iTIS-PseTNC\", was developed by incorporating the physicochemical properties into the pseudo trinucleotide composition, quite similar to the PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition) approach widely used in computational proteomics. It was observed by the rigorous cross-validation test on the benchmark dataset that the overall success rate achieved by the new predictor in identifying TIS locations was over 97%. As a web-server, iTIS-PseTNC is freely accessible at http:\/\/lin.uestc.edu.cn\/server\/iTIS-PseTNC. To maximize the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results without the need to go through the detailed mathematical equations, which are presented in this paper just for its integrity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224b","authors":["Wei Chen","Peng-Mian Feng","En-Ze Deng","Hao Lin","Kuo-Chen Chou"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ab.2014.06.022","first_seen_on":"2014-07-13T10:06:03+00:00","issns":["1096-0309"],"journal":"Analytical Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1405245923,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25016190?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25016190","pubdate":"2014-07-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"iTIS-PseTNC: a sequence-based predictor for identifying translation initiation site in human genes using pseudo trinucleotide composition.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/itispsetnc-sequencebased-predictor-identifying-translation-initiation-site-human-genes-using-pseudo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4015364,"mean":5.0309291149418,"rank":3208310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":102421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4015364,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100470,"mean":7.8389468288411,"rank":79695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100470,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":686,"mean":2.3134306569343,"rank":473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":686,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.7364444444444,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
