We previously identified that brachial artery waveforms were changed in preeclamptic women. We therefore sought to compare Doppler waveform analysis with flow mediated vascular dilation (FMVD) measurements in pregnant women.\nA cross sectional study of 71 pregnant women at >20weeks gestation comparing FMVD measurements with Doppler waveform parameters was performed. Research was conducted at three hospitals and two geographic settings; (1) Yale-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, CT, (2) Mount Hope Maternity and (3) Port of Spain General Hospital in Trinidad. Brachial artery Doppler waveform measurements were done at baseline and 90s post cuff-release. From the Doppler waveforms we assessed percent change in Peak Systolic Velocity (% \u0394PSV), systolic acceleration, acceleration time and pulsatility index and compared them with the percent change in FMVD. Statistical analysis using Student's t tests and correlation coefficient was done as necessary.\nCorrelation analysis between the % change in the Doppler waveform parameters and the % change in mean FMVD identified only the waveform parameter of % \u0394PSV as significantly correlated (p=0.040).\nFMVD remains the gold standard for assessment of endothelial dysfunction. A correlation was observed between the Doppler measured % \u0394PSV and FMVD, which may allow it to be used to assess endothelial dysfunction changes under different conditions was identified.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100085b4","authors":["Landres, Inna V.","Small, Maria","Sirjusingh, Adesh","Ramsewak, Samuel","Williams, Keith P.","Landres, Inna V","Williams, Keith P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.preghy.2014.04.005","endpage":"223","first_seen_on":"2014-07-15T03:16:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2210-7789","2210-7797","22107789"],"issue":"3","journal":"Pregnancy Hypertension: An International Journal of Women's Cardiovascular Health","last_mentioned_on":1405394111,"links":["http:\/\/www.pregnancyhypertension.org\/article\/S2210-7789(14)00064-6\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&elsca2=email&elsca3=2210-7789_201407_4_3&elsca4=elsevier"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pregnancyhypertension.org\/article\/S2210-7789(14)00064-6\/pdf","pmid":"26104609","pubdate":"2015-06-25T22:04:21+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","startpage":"220","title":"A comparison of Doppler waveform parameters versus flow-mediated vascular dilation of the brachial artery in pregnant women","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-doppler-waveform-parameters-versus-flowmediated-vascular-dilation-brachial-artery-pregnan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6093807,"mean":5.9542001343618,"rank":4449796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":933573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6093807,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135649,"mean":8.3510852058273,"rank":90300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":26525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135649,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":0.77183544303797,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
