Data were collected in the cities of Colonia Leopoldina, Novo Lino, and Uni\u00e3o dos Palmares, Alagoas state, from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (Leishmania amazonensis) who use medicinal plants to treat this disease. Plants extracts were tested at a concentration of 1-100\u2009\u03bcg\/mL in all experiments, except in an assay to evaluate activity against amastigotes, when 10\u2009\u03bcg\/mL was used. All plants extracts did not show deleterious activity to the host cell evidenced by LDH assay at 100, 10, and 1\u2009\u03bcg\/mL after 48\u2009h of incubation. The plants extracts Hyptis pectinata (L.) Poit, Aloe vera L., Ruta graveolens L., Pfaffia glomerata (Spreng.) Pedersen, and Chenopodium ambrosioides L. exhibited direct activity against extracellular forms at 100\u2009\u03bcg\/mL; these extracts inhibited growth by 81.9%, 82.9%, 74.4%, 88.7%, and 87.4%, respectively, when compared with promastigotes. The plants extracts H. pectinata, A. vera, and R. graveolens also significantly diminished the number of amastigotes at 10\u2009\u03bcg\/mL, inhibiting growth by 85.0%, 40.4%, 94.2%, and 97.4%, respectively, when compared with control. Based on these data, we conclude that the five plants exhibited considerable leishmanicidal activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["De Queiroz, Aline Cavalcanti"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/478290","first_seen_on":"2014-07-13T13:18:50+00:00","issns":["1741-427X"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1405257499,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2014\/478290\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2014\/478290.pdf","pmid":"25126099","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Antileishmanial Activity of Medicinal Plants Used in Endemic Areas in Northeastern Brazil","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antileishmanial-activity-medicinal-plants-used-endemic-areas-northeastern-brazil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3579163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109259,"mean":8.0493342547002,"rank":84487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109259,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2941,"mean":3.3794680272109,"rank":1991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2941,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":14.955,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":3,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MBHolistic\/status\/488311460452237313","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2505723],"posted_on":"2014-07-13T13:18:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Monterey Holistic","url":"http:\/\/www.montereybayholistic.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793206537254686724\/_c1aiyQP_normal.jpg","description":"501(c)3 #health #education #exercise #healthnews #nutrition #holistic #fitness #wellness #inspirational #healing #success #quotes #yoga #chiropractic #fitness","id_on_source":"MBHolistic","tweeter_id":"28173797","geo":{"lt":37.25022,"ln":-119.75126,"country":"US"},"followers":28293},"tweet_id":"488311460452237313"}]}}
