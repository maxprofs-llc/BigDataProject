We developed several neutron optical elements suitable for a new sophisticated setup, i.e., DC spin-turners and Larmor-accelerators which diminish thermal disturbances and depolarisation considerably. The gain in performance is exploited demonstrating violation of a Bell-like inequality for a spin-path entangled single-neutron state. The obtained value of [Formula: see text], which is much higher than previous measurements by neutron interferometry, is [Formula: see text] above the limit of S=2 predicted by contextual hidden variable theories. The new setup is more flexible referring to state preparation and analysis, therefore new, more precise measurements can be carried out.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f6100031f8","authors":["Geppert, H","Denkmayr, T","Sponar, S","Lemmel, H","Hasegawa, Y"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nima.2014.06.080","endpage":"423","first_seen_on":"2014-07-13T15:58:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01689002","0168-9002"],"journal":"Nuclear Instruments & Methods in Physics Research Section A","last_mentioned_on":1405267090,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168900214008341"],"pmid":"26089579","pubdate":"2015-06-20T22:08:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"417","title":"Improvement of the polarized neutron interferometer setup demonstrating violation of a Bell-like inequality ","type":"article","volume":"763","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improvement-polarized-neutron-interferometer-setup-demonstrating-violation-belllike-inequality"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4016074,"mean":5.0288947138712,"rank":3207763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":103658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4016074,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100479,"mean":7.8380633776886,"rank":79689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100479,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1030,"mean":0.92680272108844,"rank":244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1030,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.36111111111111,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
