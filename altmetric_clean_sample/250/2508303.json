Five pictures were selected per set. The participants observed the pictures on a computer screen while the experimenter said the name of the picture. Then, the emission of untaught uninstructed tacts of the pictures was tested without reinforcement. The cycle was repeated until a criterion of 90% correct responses was achieved. Thereafter, in probes without reinforcement, the participants tacted the pictures without specific instructions and also when asked to name them, and selected the correct picture upon hearing their names. The procedure was repeated with two additional stimulus sets and the probed relations emerged always. Two children showed the emergence with fewer trials across sets, which indicate emergence induction. Thus, the procedure served to test whether the pairing naming capability was missing and induced the capability. The results may have important utility in teaching persons diagnosed with autism and other learning difficulties and for accelerating learning in all children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003464","doi":"10.1016\/j.ridd.2014.06.004","first_seen_on":"2014-07-14T20:09:17+00:00","issns":["08914222"],"journal":"Research in Developmental Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1405368491,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0891422214002406","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0891422214002406&_version=1&md5=dc41db74f6d3eb8fc27912d7af3bf1a4"],"pmid":"25014270","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Induction of naming after observing visual stimuli and their names in children with autism ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/induction-naming-after-observing-visual-stimuli-names-children-autism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250328,"mean":6.9709426969313,"rank":6260010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1114371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250328,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180058,"mean":7.6427715001363,"rank":116618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":35015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180058,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1426,"mean":3.1872673684211,"rank":933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1426,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":4.5530625,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
