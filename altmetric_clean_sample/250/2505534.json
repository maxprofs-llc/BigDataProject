The strategy can be decomposed into the up-regulation of precursor supply in the acetyl-CoA module and the MVA pathway (push-strategy), increase of the isoprene branch flux (pull-strategy), and down-regulation of the competing pathway (restrain-strategy). Furthermore, to reduce the production cost arising from galactose addition and meanwhile maintain the high expression of Gal promoters, the galactose regulatory network was modulated by Gal80p deletion. Finally, the engineered strain YXM10-ispS-ispS could accumulate up to 37mg\/L isoprene (about 782-fold increase compared to the parental strain) under aerobic conditions with glycerol-sucrose as carbon source. In this way, a new potential platform for isoprene production was established via metabolic engineering of the yeast native pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd3","authors":["Xiaomei Lv","Wenping Xie","Wenqiang Lu","Fei Guo","Jiali Gu","Hongwei Yu","Lidan Ye"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiotec.2014.06.024","first_seen_on":"2014-07-13T10:14:47+00:00","issns":["1873-4863"],"journal":"Journal of Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1405246473,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25016205?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25016205","pubdate":"2014-07-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Enhanced isoprene biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by engineering of the native acetyl-CoA and mevalonic acid pathways with a push-pull-restrain strategy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhanced-isoprene-biosynthesis-saccharomyces-cerevisiae-engineering-native-acetylcoa-mevalonic-acid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4015364,"mean":5.0309291149418,"rank":3208311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":102421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4015364,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100470,"mean":7.8389468288411,"rank":79695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100470,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":514,"mean":1.6160584795322,"rank":315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":514,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.4076923076923,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
