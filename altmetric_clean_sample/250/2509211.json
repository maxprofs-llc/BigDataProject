Modulators of the \u03b17 nAChR have been extensively reviewed for the treatment of the cognitive deficits associated with these pathologies. SEN12333 represents a novel \u03b17 nAChR agonist chemotype with potential for reduced side effects but requiring further SAR exploration. The present work investigates the amide bond of SEN12333, specifically its connectivity and replacement with the tetrazole functionality, a known cis amide isostere. The results reveal the original amide bond connectivity of SEN12333 to be favorable for binding affinity and agonist activity at \u03b17 nAChRs. The use of a tetrazole isostere completely abolishes affinity and functional activity and suggests that SEN12333 binds in a linear conformation. Results reported herein also suggest the pyridine nitrogen within the terminal aromatic ring of SEN12333 is not essential for binding affinity or functional activity. Further SAR investigations involving manipulation of other moieties contained within SEN12333 are warranted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2014.07.029","first_seen_on":"2014-07-15T02:03:49+00:00","issns":["02235234"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1405389771,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0223523414006369"],"pmid":"25019477","publisher":"Elsevier Masson SAS","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Investigations of amide bond variation and biaryl modification in analogues of \u03b17 nAChR agonist SEN12333 ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigations-amide-bond-variation-biaryl-modification-analogues-%CE%B17-nachr-agonist-sen12333"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3040236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109566,"mean":8.0689806233746,"rank":72012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109566,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":632,"mean":1.0913280507132,"rank":263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":632,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":0.78322448979592,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
