The aim of this study is to report this distribution in Algeria. A panel of four hematopathologists classified 197 consecutive cases according to the WHO classification, including 87.3% B-cell and 12.7% T- or NK-cell NHL. This series was compared to similar cohorts from Western Europe (WEU) and North America (NA). Algeria had a significantly higher frequency of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL: 52.8%) and a lower frequency of follicular lymphoma (FL: 13.2%) compared to WEU (DLBCL: 32.2%: FL: 20.0%,) and NA (DLBCL: 29.3%; FL: 33.6%). The frequency of mantle cell lymphoma was lower in Algeria (2.5%) compared to WEU (8.3%). Smaller differences were also found among the NK\/T-cell lymphomas. In conclusion, we found important differences between Algeria and Western countries, and further epidemiologic studies are needed to explain these differences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["Nadia Boudjerra","Anamarija M Perry","Jos\u00e9e Audouin","Jacques Diebold","Bharat N Nathwani","Kenneth A MacLennan","Hans K M\u00fcller-Hermelink","Martin Bast","Eugene Boilesen","James O Armitage","Dennis D Weisenburger"],"doi":"10.3109\/10428194.2014.939967","first_seen_on":"2014-07-12T12:26:04+00:00","issns":["1029-2403"],"journal":"Leukemia & Lymphoma","last_mentioned_on":1405159839,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25012941?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25012941","pubdate":"2014-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Classification of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in Algeria according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/classification-nonhodgkin-lymphoma-algeria-according-world-health-organization-classification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4199616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125291,"mean":8.2520519275284,"rank":100942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125291,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":831,"mean":1.616886746988,"rank":654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":831,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.1891891891892,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
