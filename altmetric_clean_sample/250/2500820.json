The completion of the rice genome draft sequences in 2002 not only accelerated functional genome studies, but also initiated a new era of resequencing rice genomes. Based on the reference genome in rice, next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the high-throughput sequencing system can efficiently accomplish whole genome resequencing of various genetic populations and diverse germplasm resources. Resequencing technology has been effectively utilized in evolutionary analysis, rice genomics and functional genomics studies. This technique is beneficial for both bridging the knowledge gap between genotype and phenotype and facilitating molecular breeding via gene design in rice. Here, we also discuss the limitation, application and future prospects of rice resequencing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008825","authors":["Longbiao Guo","Zhenyu Gao","Qian Qian"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12284-014-0004-7","first_seen_on":"2014-07-11T02:12:41+00:00","issns":["1939-8425"],"issue":"1","journal":"Rice","last_mentioned_on":1405103115,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25006357?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25006357","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Application of resequencing to rice genomics, functional genomics and evolutionary analysis.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-resequencing-rice-genomics-functional-genomics-evolutionary-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505835,"mean":5.1065363657613,"rank":1938953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2526806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505835,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108673,"mean":7.955097283569,"rank":41811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":65732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108673,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":1.8205714285714,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
