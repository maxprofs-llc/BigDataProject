Paralleling findings in the general populations of the two countries, the Chicago patients were more often overweight or obese as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) guidelines, and more often had elevated blood pressure (BP) as defined by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, MD, USA guidelines. The Ibadan patients did not receive the pneumococcal vaccine or hydroxyurea (HU) therapy as frequently as the Chicago patients. Consistent with lower rates of elevated BP and increased body mass index (BMI), stroke history was less frequent in the Ibadan patients \u226518 years old. Furthermore, in combined analyses, systolic and diastolic BP directly correlated with BMI, and elevated weight status independently associated with history of stroke. Our findings are consistent with the possibility that higher values for BMI and BP in Chicago sickle cell anemia patients may contribute to an increased risk of stroke and highlights the need for measures to reduce these risk factors. On the other hand, lower pneumococcal vaccination and HU therapy rates in Ibadan patients highlights the need for more improved vaccination coverage and for studies to define the role of HU therapy in Africa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004761","authors":["Akingbola TS","Tayo BO","Salako B","Layden JE","Hsu LL","Cooper RS","Gordeuk VR","Saraf SL"],"doi":"10.3109\/03630269.2014.927363","first_seen_on":"2014-07-15T08:28:08+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["0363-0269"],"issue":"","journal":"Hemoglobin","last_mentioned_on":1405416682,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24941131"],"pmid":"24941131","pubdate":"2014-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Comparison of Patients from Nigeria and the USA Highlights Modifiable Risk Factors for Sickle Cell Anemia Complications.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-patients-nigeria-usa-highlights-modifiable-risk-factors-sickle-cell-anemia-complications-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2297624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1614841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109559,"mean":8.0154547363043,"rank":53671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":40506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109559,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":0.97366071428571,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
