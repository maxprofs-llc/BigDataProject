Working memory load was systematically varied using complex and simple stimulus material and parametrically increasing retention periods. Activation patterns for the difference between retention of complex and simple memorized stimuli were examined in order to preclude that the reported effects are caused by differences in retrieval.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cd","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2202-15-85","first_seen_on":"2014-07-11T21:38:50+00:00","issns":["1471-2202"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1409490856,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2202\/15\/85\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2202-15-85.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2202-15-85.pdf","pmid":"25015103","pubdate":"2014-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"85","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Human area MT+ shows load-dependent activation during working memory maintenance with continuously morphing stimulation","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-area-mt-shows-loaddependent-activation-during-working-memory-maintenance-continuously-morphing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1712660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2762116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108691,"mean":8.0461985095228,"rank":34721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":72893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108691,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":640,"mean":2.8340281690141,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":640,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.4445161290323,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
