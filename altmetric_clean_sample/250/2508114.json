The possibility of an IgE-mediated allergic mechanism and the role of histamine remains controversial. The aim of the present study was the evaluation of serum total IgE and histamine levels in migraine patients and the intluence of allergy on them. 70 patients (18-58 years) with migraine without aura were divided in to 2 groups according to their history of allergy (60% with and 40% without allergy). Serum samples were collected during fasting without allowing any premedication in 2 conditions of attack and remission periods. There was a control group containing 45 healthy volunteers. Serum total IgE and histamine levels were measured by ELISA and fluorimetric methods respectively. Mean and standard error of serum histamine (ng\/ml) and total IgE (lU\/mI) levels were found in control group as 48.16+\/-2.70, 38.31+\/-3.20 and in migraine with an allergy group as 159.11+\/-4.60, 303.30+\/-42.50 and in migraine without an allergy group as 105.01 +\/-8.50, 79.07+\/-2.70 respectively. Total IgE levels in migraine group with allergy were found significantly (P<0.0001) above the control and another group suggesting an influence of an IgE-mediated mechanism on migraine. Plasma histamine levels were significantly elevated (P<0.0001) in patients with migraine both during headache and symptom-free periods compared with control group although it shows that there is an increased susceptibility to histamine in allergic conditions, nonetheless this molecule has also an unrelated role in migraine. The relationship between allergy and migraine can be based in part on IgE-mediated mechanism, with histamine release playing an important role. Thus avoidance of allergic conditions in migraine patients may be a simple helpful way to prophylaxis or their treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f03","authors":["Gazerani P","Pourpak Z","Ahmadiani A","Hemmati A","Kazemnejad A"],"doi":"02.01\/ijaai.1724","first_seen_on":"2014-07-14T18:35:09+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Iranian Journal of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1405362881,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/17301352\/"],"pmid":"17301352","pubdate":"2007-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"A Correlation between Migraine, Histamine and Immunoglobulin E.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlation-between-migraine-histamine-immunoglobulin-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508238,"mean":5.1674528195662,"rank":2278969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1654775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508238,"percentile":36},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109517,"mean":8.1006662770739,"rank":53129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":42763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109517,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":0.82188148148148,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.55,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
