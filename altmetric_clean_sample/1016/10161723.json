The drivers were interviewed regarding sociodemographic characteristics, working conditions, behavior in traffic and involvement in accidents or near-miss accidents in the previous 12 months. Subsequently, the participants answered a self-applied questionnaire on substance use. The time of professional experience as drivers was categorized in tertiles. Statistical analyses were performed through the construction of models adjusted by multinomial regression to assess the relationship between the length of experience as a truck driver and the involvement in accidents or near-miss accidents.\nThis study included 665 male drivers with an average age of 42.2 (\u00b111.1) years. Among them, 7.2% and 41.7% of the drivers reported involvement in accidents and near-miss accidents, respectively. In fully adjusted analysis, the 3rd tertile of professional experience (>22years) was shown to be inversely associated with involvement in accidents (odds ratio [OR] 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.52) and near-miss accidents (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.05-0.53). The 2nd tertile of professional experience (11-22 years) was inversely associated with involvement in accidents (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.40-0.98).\nAn evident relationship was observed between longer professional experience and a reduction in reporting involvement in accidents and near-miss accidents, regardless of age, substance use, working conditions and behavior in traffic.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213e","authors":["Girotto, Edmarlon","Andrade, Selma Maffei de","Gonz\u00e1lez, Alberto Dur\u00e1n","Mesas, Arthur Eumann","Edmarlon Girotto","Selma Maffei de Andrade","Alberto Dur\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez","Arthur Eumann Mesas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aap.2016.07.004","endpage":"304","first_seen_on":"2016-07-31T20:09:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-2057","00014575"],"issue":"Pt A","journal":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1469995746,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27474875?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.aap.2016.07.004"],"pmid":"27474875","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Transportation And Freight Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"299","title":"Professional experience and traffic accidents\/near-miss accidents among truck drivers","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/professional-experience-traffic-accidentsnearmiss-accidents-among-truck-drivers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":7066945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257481,"mean":11.991350730153,"rank":217383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257481,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2546,"mean":5.6682444007859,"rank":1945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2546,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.9396341463415,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
