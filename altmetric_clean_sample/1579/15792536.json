After plaque classification according to MRI-modified AHA Lesion-Type (LT), PPs (K(trans) , kep , ve , and vp ) of DCE-MRI were measured. The Extended Tofts model was used for calculation of PPs. For participants with multiple carotid plaques, the plaque with the worst MRI-modified AHA LT was chosen for analysis. Correlations between PPs and plaque types and the ability of these parameters to distinguish stable and vulnerable plaques suspected on MRI were assessed.\nSignificant positive correlation between K(trans) and LT III to VI was found (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.532, P < 0.001), as was the correlation between kep and LT III to VI (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.409, P < 0.001). Stable and vulnerable plaques suspected on MRI could potentially be distinguished by K(trans) (sensitivity 83%, specificity 100%) and kep (sensitivity 77%, specificity 91%).\nK(trans) and kep from DCE-MRI can provide quantitative information to monitor plaque vulnerability in vivo and differentiate vulnerable plaques suspected on MRI from stable ones. These two parameters could be adopted as imaging biomarkers for plaque characterization and risk stratification.\n1 J. Magn. Reson.
