However, the study of the molecular mechanism of its bioactivity especially the anti-inflammatory activity is still scanty. In the present study, the pure HEO isolated from the dried Hippocampus trimaculatus leach was firstly found to have anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. The molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity was detailed using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, suggesting that the HEO can significantly suppress the inflammatory factors of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin (1L)-1\u03b2 (1L-1\u03b2). Cellular signaling analyses demonstrated that the HEO downregulated the NF-\u03baB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. All the results suggested that the HEO is a potential natural anti-inflammatory agent.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007461","authors":["Jingna Wu","Zhiyu Liu","Jie Su","Nan Pan","Qiuling Song"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6fo01154c","first_seen_on":"2017-01-25T16:01:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2042-6496","2042-650X"],"journal":"Food & Function","last_mentioned_on":1485351023,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/FO\/C6FO01154C?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2FFO+%28RSC+-+Food+%26+Function+latest+articles+%29"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/fo\/c6fo01154c","pmid":"28119977","pubdate":"2017-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["physiology","chemistry","nutritionalsciences","biochemistry"],"title":"Anti-inflammatory activity of 3\u03b2-hydroxycholest-5-en-7-one isolated from Hippocampus trimaculatus leach via inhibiting iNOS, TNF-\u03b1, and 1L-1\u03b2 of LPS induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8098931,"mean":6.8880547472244,"rank":7011401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8098931,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261066,"mean":12.832181732518,"rank":216022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261066,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1414,"mean":4.0261585279547,"rank":1206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1414,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":1.4747706422018,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cheminfochem\/statuses\/824248049933385729","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15792839],"posted_on":"2017-01-25T13:30:23+00:00","author":{"name":"cheminfochem","url":"http:\/\/www.infochem.co.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/595534993138429952\/ULVzIDHv_normal.jpg","description":"We want people to understand the technicalities behind the beauty of physics, the mystery of chemistry and the loveliness of science as a whole.","id_on_source":"cheminfochem","tweeter_id":"3235595698","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6},"tweet_id":"824248049933385729"}]}}
