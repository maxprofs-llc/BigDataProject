The lean principle of creating a culture of change and accountability was established by: 1) engaging stakeholders, 2) managing the process with performance accountability, and, 3) delivering patient-centered care. The RRI utilized three major lean principles: 1) A3, 2) root cause analyses, 3) value stream mapping.\nBaseline readmission rate at UCLA from 9\/2010-12\/2011 illustrated a mean of 12.1%. After the start of the RRI program, for the period of 1\/2012-6\/2013, the readmission rate decreased to 11.3% (p<0.05).\nTo impact readmissions, solutions must evolve from smaller service- and location-based interventions into strategies with broader approach. As elucidated, a systematic clinical approach grounded in lean methodologies is a viable solution to this complex problem.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d13cf058f610000ae6","authors":["Nasim Afsar-manesh","Sarah Lonowski","Aram A.
