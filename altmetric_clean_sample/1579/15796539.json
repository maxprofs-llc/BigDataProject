Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were used to describe the association of weapon-carrying during the past 30 days with physical fighting and fight-related injury during the past 12 months.\nWeapon-carrying (15%) and physical fighting (39%) were common among adolescents. One out of 30 (3.3%) adolescents reported receiving medical care for fight-related injuries. Controlling for demographic characteristics, youth who carried weapons were more likely than those who did not to have been in a physical fight (OR = 3.3). The association between weapon-carrying and physical fighting was stronger among females (OR = 5.0) than among males (OR = 2.9), but did not vary significantly by age, race\/ethnicity, or place of residence (urban, suburban, rural). Controlling for frequency of physical fighting and demographics, adolescents who carried a handgun (OR = 2.6) or other weapon (OR = 1.6) were more likely than those who did not carry a weapon to have had medical care for fight-related injuries.\nAmong adolescents, weapon-carrying is associated with increased involvement in physical fighting and a greater likelihood of injury among those who do fight. Efforts to reduce fight-related injuries among youth should stress avoidance of weapon-carrying.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002215","authors":["R Lowry"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0749-3797(97)00020-2","endpage":"129","first_seen_on":"2017-01-25T16:35:10+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["07493797","0749-3797"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1230768000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0749-3797(97)00020-2"],"pmid":"9631164","pubdate":"1998-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"122","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Weapon-carrying, physical fighting, and fight-related injury among U.S. adolescents","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0749379797000202","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/weaponcarrying-physical-fighting-fightrelated-injury-among-adolescents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565810,"mean":6.5304467083386,"rank":818560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6706907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565810,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226554,"mean":12.931875419879,"rank":39483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":186750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226554,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2529,"mean":21.081943037975,"rank":757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2529,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":50.596227642276,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
