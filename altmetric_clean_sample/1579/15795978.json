The mean induction to abortion interval was 45.0 +\/- 41.5, 33.4 +\/- 34.9 and 22.3 +\/- 14.3 h, respectively. The mean dose of misoprostol required to induce abortion was 416.7 microg, 772.8 microg and 1296 microg. The rate of nausea and vomiting was 3.9%, 12% and 20%. The diarrhea occurrence rate was 0%, 6% and 22% with temperature elevation 0%, 2% and 28%, respectively. The rate of incomplete abortion was 35.3%, 28% and 22%, respectively.\nThe 600-microg dose is more effective as an abortifacient agent for second trimester abortion in terms of 48-h success rate and the rate of incomplete abortion but with more side effects. However, the side effects were mild and did not warrant any specific treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b55","authors":["Y Herabutya","P O-Prasertsawat"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0020-7292(97)00244-0","endpage":"165","first_seen_on":"2017-01-25T16:31:20+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["00207292","0020-7292"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics","last_mentioned_on":1104537600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0020-7292(97)00244-0"],"pmid":"9509955","pubdate":"1998-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"161","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Second trimester abortion using intravaginal misoprostol","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1016\/S0020-7292%2897%2900244-0","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/second-trimester-abortion-using-intravaginal-misoprostol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7044225,"mean":6.2633024756142,"rank":1653557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4556415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7044225,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89977,"mean":11.139805325865,"rank":27352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":61042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89977,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1386,"mean":3.5749357400722,"rank":295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1386,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.1125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Termination of second trimester, complicated gestation","url":"http:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/bitstream\/10665\/116991\/1\/11_4_2005_657_662.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[15795933,15795947,15795952,14600061,15795956,15795967,20580937,15795978,15795988,20580939,15795990],"posted_on":"2005-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"World Health Organization","description":"The World Health Organization (WHO) is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.","geo":{"country":"CH"}},"page_url":"http:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/handle\/10665\/116991","collections":[],"author":{"image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/cache.altmetric.com\/policy\/thumbnails\/thumbnail-f2f6555191ca0d1faae89cc56966923db9e0e0c7686bd3e4f9adb1dad4d62578.jpg"}}]}}
