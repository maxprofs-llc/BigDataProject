One approach in clinical testing is passive immunization with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting alpha toxin for the prevention or treatment of Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. Passive immunization with the human anti-alpha toxin mAb, MEDI4893* has been shown to improve disease outcome in murine S. aureus pneumonia models. The species specificity of some S. aureus toxins necessitates testing anti-S. aureus therapeutics in alternate species. We developed a necrotizing pneumonia model in ferrets and utilized an existing rabbit pneumonia model to characterize MEDI4893* protective activity in species other than mice. MEDI4893* prophylaxis reduced disease severity in the ferret and rabbit pneumonia models against both community-associated MRSA and hospital-associated MRSA strains. Additionally, adjunctive treatment of MEDI4893* with either vancomycin or linezolid provided enhanced protection in rabbits relative to the antibiotics alone. These results confirm MEDI4893 is a promising candidate for immunotherapy against S. aureus pneumonia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Binh An Diep","Jamese J.
