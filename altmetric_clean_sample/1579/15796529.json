In this work, SERS is originally used to enhance the own vibrational density of states (VDOS) of nude and isolated gold nanoparticles. This offers the opportunity of analyzing finite size effects on the lattice dynamics which remains unattainable with conventional techniques based on neutron or x-ray inelastic scattering. By reducing the size down to few nanometers, the role of surface atoms versus volume atoms become dominant, and the \"text-book\" 3D-2D transition on the dynamical behavior is experimentally emphasized. \"Anomalies\" that have been predicted by a large panel of simulations at the atomic scale, are really observed, like the enhancement of the VDOS at low frequencies or the occurrence of localized modes at frequencies beyond the cut-off in bulk. Consequences on the thermodynamic properties at the nanoscale, like the reduction of the Debye temperature or the excess of the specific heat, have been evaluated. Finally the high sensitivity of reminiscent bulk-like phonons on the arrangements at the atomic scale is used to access the morphology and internal disorder of the nanoparticles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["R.
