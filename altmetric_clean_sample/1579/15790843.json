We succeeded in controlling the molecular motion by binding luminophores in close proximity with the [2.2]paracyclophane scaffold. For example, aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active luminophores were converted to show intense photoluminescence (PL) even in a diluted solution at room temperature and the resulting compound worked as a single-molecule thermo-responsible material around room temperature. Because of the AIE-active unit, the molecular motion could be easily activated by heating, leading to variable and reversible PL intensity. Furthermore, the \u03c0-conjugated systems with the planar chirality of 4,7,12,15-tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane provided excellent characteristics on circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The obtained dimers showed high CPL performances both in a diluted solution and in an aggregation state. We succeeded in proving that the simple molecular designs composed of only carbon and hydrogen atoms can create versatile optical functionalities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Gon, Masayuki","Morisaki, Yasuhiro","Chujo, Yoshiki"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201605598","first_seen_on":"2017-01-25T15:33:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0947-6539","1521-3765","09476539"],"journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1487771674,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605598\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605598\/abstract;jsessionid=7874793F41EE57C31A6201AE02B447C3.f01t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605598\/pdf","pmid":"28121051","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Optically Active Phenylethene Dimers Based on Planar Chiral Tetrasubstituted [2.2]Paracyclophane","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optically-active-phenylethene-dimers-based-planar-chiral-tetrasubstituted-22paracyclophane"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8445227,"mean":7.1001175639268,"rank":6407873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1148198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8445227,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282346,"mean":12.503658715401,"rank":202037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":49660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282346,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6360,"mean":3.189586412958,"rank":3792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6360,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":627,"mean":3.5433865814696,"rank":356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":627,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
