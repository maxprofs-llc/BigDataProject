We used two different measures to identify adolescents with high levels of CU traits: the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD) [1] and the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU) [2]. Questionnaires and structured interviews were used to evaluate a range of outcomes including presence of baseline levels and treatment outcomes of both externalizing and internalizing problems.\nResults indicated that the ICU, but not the APSD differentiated between conduct disordered youth with and without the specifier on externalizing behaviors in both cross-sectional relations and treatment response.\nThe results of the current study caution the use of the most frequently used measure to identify the CU specifier, and make suggestions about alternatives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000582e","authors":["Salome Vanwoerden","Tyson Reuter","Carla Sharp","Vanwoerden, Salome","Reuter, Tyson","Sharp, Carla"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.comppsych.2016.05.012","endpage":"131","first_seen_on":"2016-05-19T22:47:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8384","0010440X"],"journal":"Comprehensive Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1492518122,"links":["http:\/\/www.comppsychjournal.com\/article\/S0010-440X(15)30365-5\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27423352?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27423352?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27423352?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.comppsychjournal.com\/article\/S0010440X15303655\/pdf","pmid":"27423352","pubdate":"2016-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"116","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Exploring the clinical utility of the DSM-5 conduct disorder specifier of \u2018with limited prosocial emotions\u2019 in an adolescent inpatient sample","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-clinical-utility-dsm5-conduct-disorder-specifier-limited-prosocial-emotions-adolescent-inp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082745,"mean":6.8630429413494,"rank":5851465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1944439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082745,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271818,"mean":11.611592976156,"rank":173190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":82894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271818,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1238,"mean":3.1250703314471,"rank":871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1238,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":1.719298245614,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
