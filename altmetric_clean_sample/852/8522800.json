Reducing the error rate is necessary for subsequent utilisation of the reads in, e.g., de novo genome assembly. The error correction problem has been tackled either by aligning the long reads against each other or by a hybrid approach that uses the more accurate short reads produced by second generation sequencing technologies to correct the long reads.\nWe present an error correction method that uses long reads only. The method consists of two phases: first we use an iterative alignment-free correction method based on de Bruijn graphs with increasing length of k-mers, and second, the corrected reads are further polished using long-distance dependencies that are found using multiple alignments. According to our experiments the proposed method is the most accurate one relying on long reads only for read sets with high coverage. Furthermore, when the coverage of the read set is at least 75x, the throughput of the new method is at least 20% higher.\nLoRMA is freely available at http:\/\/www.cs.helsinki.fi\/u\/lmsalmel\/LoRMA\/ CONTACT: leena.salmela@cs.helsinki.fi.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Leena Salmela","Riku Walve","Eric Rivals","Esko Ukkonen","Salmela, Leena","Walve, Riku","Rivals, Eric","Ukkonen, Esko"],"doi":"10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btw321","first_seen_on":"2016-06-07T04:08:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-2059","1367-4811","1367-4803"],"journal":"Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1491230195,"links":["http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/03\/bioinformatics.btw321.short?rss=1","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/03\/bioinformatics.btw321.short?rss=1&utm_content=bufferf0be6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27273673?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27273673","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/16\/bioinformatics.btw321.long","https:\/\/hal-lirmm.ccsd.cnrs.fr\/lirmm-01385006","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/bioinformatics\/article\/33\/6\/799\/2525585\/Accurate-self-correction-of-errors-in-long-reads#.WN4PJmMbJWY.twitter","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/bioinformatics\/article\/33\/6\/799\/2525585\/Accurate-self-correction-of-errors-in-long-reads"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/03\/bioinformatics.btw321.full.pdf","pmid":"27273673","pubdate":"2016-06-09T21:41:24+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"btw321","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Accurate selfcorrection of errors in long reads using de Bruijn graphs","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/accurate-selfcorrection-errors-long-reads-using-bruijn-graphs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.5,"score_history":{"1y":11.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":608490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7843338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273502,"mean":11.604620407238,"rank":28692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":244732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273502,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5821,"mean":6.7784666666667,"rank":676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5821,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228,"mean":10.634273127753,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
