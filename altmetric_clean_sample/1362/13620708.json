Pain, volume, and ROM were recorded before and after treatment continuously for 3 days.Results Effects were evaluated as \"Immediately after application\" and \"3 days after continuous application.\" Immediately after application, there was no difference between the 2 modalities on ankle ROM; heat reduced pain over contrast therapy, and both modalities increased swelling. When considering the effects after continuous application for 3 days, no difference was found between the 2 modalities on ROM and the reduction of pain. Contrast therapy reduced swelling while heat caused increased swelling even after 3 days.Conclusion The use of different thermal modalities during the transition from the acute to chronic phase of injury can be suggested as effective treatment options according to the objectives of injury management: pain reduction, improve ROM, and swelling management.\nTherapeutic, Level II: Randomized clinical trial.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f61000746d","authors":["R.
