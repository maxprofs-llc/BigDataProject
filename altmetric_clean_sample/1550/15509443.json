C-HO[double bond, length as m-dash]C hydrogen-bonding motifs dominate the local structure of propylene carbonate, giving rise to the formation of head-to-tail correlated chains of molecules. In contrast, glycerol carbonate exhibits a more disordered structure with no overall dominant interactions in which the pendant hydroxyl function disrupts structure-making correlations present in propylene carbonate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Yoan M.
