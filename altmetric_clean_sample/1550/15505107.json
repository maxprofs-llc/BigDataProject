Traditional analysis methods analyze each type of data individually and integrate their results using Venn diagrams. Challenges arise, however, when the results are irreproducible and inconsistent across multiple platforms. To address these issues, one possible approach is to concurrently analyze both gene expression profiling and CNAs in the same individual.\nWe have developed an open-source R\/Bioconductor package (iGC). Multiple input formats are supported and users can define their own criteria for identifying differentially expressed genes driven by CNAs. The analysis of two real microarray datasets demonstrated that the CNA-driven genes identified by the iGC package showed significantly higher Pearson correlation coefficients with their gene expression levels and copy numbers than those genes located in a genomic region with CNA. Compared with the Venn diagram approach, the iGC package showed better performance.\nThe iGC package is effective and useful for identifying CNA-driven genes. By simultaneously considering both comparative genomic and transcriptomic data, it can provide better understanding of biological and medical questions. The iGC package's source code and manual are freely available at https:\/\/www.bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/iGC.html .","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Yi-Pin Lai","Liang-Bo Wang","Wei-An Wang","Liang-Chuan Lai","Mong-Hsun Tsai","Tzu-Pin Lu","Eric Y.
