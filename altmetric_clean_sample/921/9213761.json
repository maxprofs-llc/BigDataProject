We investigated the acute effects of oral administration of 12 of these preparations in non-obese women and men. No significant increase in energy expenditure (EE) has been noted after treatment with any of these preparations. No change in respiratory quotient (RQ) was shown, except after treatment with mat\u00e9 (Ilex paraguariensis) extract, where a drop in RQ was observed, indicating a rise in the proportion of fat oxidized. The results suggested the poor potential of these plant preparations in the treatment of obesity, except possibly for the mat\u00e9 extract. Further studies are required to explore the influence of higher dosages of these preparations as well as chronic administration in man.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c39","authors":["Martinet, A","Hostettmann, K","Schutz, Y"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0944-7113(99)80014-2","endpage":"238","first_seen_on":"2016-07-04T17:42:24+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0944-7113","09447113"],"issue":"4","journal":"Phytomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1467545803,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10589441"],"pmid":"10589441","pubdate":"1999-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"231","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Thermogenic effects of commercially available plant preparations aimed at treating human obesity","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thermogenic-effects-commercially-available-plant-preparations-aimed-treating-human-obesity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7981790,"mean":6.7349664530035,"rank":492405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7485041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7981790,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260424,"mean":11.501350594993,"rank":25249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":235095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260424,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":775,"mean":5.4949870801034,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":775,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.9886363636364,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
