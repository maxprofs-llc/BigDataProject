Prevention of all forms of pain and distress including pain during vaccination is an ethical duty for health providers and health systems. Yet most persons in low and middle income countries have little or no access to pain prevention. Furthermore, immunization pain can lead to vaccine hesitancy, and WHO has recognized that vaccine hesitancy is associated with decreased vaccination rates. In acknowledgement of these challenges, WHO SAGE has now published new guidance on preventing pain during vaccination [1].","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["Pottie, Kevin","Siu, Winnie","Duclos, Philippe","Kevin Pottie","Winnie Siu","Philippe Duclos"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2015.11.064","endpage":"3628","first_seen_on":"2016-07-04T17:07:46+00:00","issns":["1873-2518","0264410X"],"issue":"32","journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1468000672,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0264410X15017454","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0264410X15017454?sf30227025%3D1%26cc%3Dy","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0264410X15017454?sf30227026%3D1%26cc%3Dy","http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0264410X15017454?via=sd&cc=y&sf30227026=1","http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0264410X15017454?via=sd&cc=y&sf30227025=1","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.vaccine.2015.11.064"],"pmid":"26778423","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"3627","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"New recommendations to prevent pain during immunizations: WHO position paper \u2013 September 2015","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-recommendations-prevent-pain-during-immunizations-position-paper-september-2015"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336514,"mean":7.0288438396164,"rank":1957172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6365983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336514,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263245,"mean":11.656531104222,"rank":77098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":185397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263245,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5599,"mean":7.5886152197213,"rank":1447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":4142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5599,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144,"mean":17.393398601399,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kyliesturgess\/statuses\/749742991418335232","license":"gnip","rt":["NCIRS"],"citation_ids":[9212765],"posted_on":"2016-07-03T23:13:53+00:00","author":{"name":"KylieSturgess","url":"http:\/\/www.kyliesturgess.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/887204523600560128\/rjWWXs5t_normal.jpg","description":"RTRFM The Mag host, @TokenSkeptic, @365Philosophy & @TalkRTR podcaster.
