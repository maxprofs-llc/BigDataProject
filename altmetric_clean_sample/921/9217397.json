The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of CIEV on peripheral organ systems affected by alcohol abuse, including the liver, lungs, and cardiovascular system.\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to daily CIEV for a period of 8\u00a0weeks (14HR ON\/10HR OFF), producing blood alcohol levels of ~200\u00a0mg\/dl. Controls were exposed to room air. After 8\u00a0weeks, echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function. Indices of liver injury (alanine and aspartate aminotransferases [ALT and AST]; cytochrome p450 2E1 [CYP2E1]; alcohol dehydrogenase [ADH]; Oil Red O and triglyceride content; lipid peroxidation; inflammatory cytokine expression; and macrophage infiltration), and lung inflammatory cell count, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and lipid peroxidation were measured.\nLeft ventricular posterior wall thickness was significantly decreased, and systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated by CIEV compared with air controls. CIEV led to a significant increase in plasma ALT and triglycerides compared with room air controls. CIEV did not affect liver triglyceride content, lipid staining or peroxidation, but increased CYP2E1 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) protein expression, while decreasing ADH expression. CIEV significantly increased numbers of both polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, indicative of pulmonary inflammation. However, CIEV did not produce significant changes in lung mass, pulmonary lipid peroxidation, inflammatory cytokine expression, or edema.\nThese results show that CIEV produces hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiovascular effects in rats similar to those found in other models of chronic alcohol administration. Alcohol vapor administration is a novel method of alcohol-induced tissue injury with high potential for widespread use in alcohol toxicology research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021cc","authors":["Mouton, Alan J.","Maxi, John K.","Souza\u2010Smith, Flavia","Bagby, Gregory J.","Gilpin, Nicholas W.","Molina, Patricia E.","Gardner, Jason D."],"doi":"10.1111\/acer.13133","endpage":"1678","first_seen_on":"2016-07-04T23:36:42+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1530-0277"],"issue":"8","journal":"Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research","last_mentioned_on":1467619221,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/acer.13133"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/acer.13133\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4961570","pmid":"27375174","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1671","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Alcohol Vapor Inhalation as a Model of Alcohol-Induced Organ Disease","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alcohol-vapor-inhalation-model-alcoholinduced-organ-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":6910354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260486,"mean":11.50051257462,"rank":218695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260486,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1941,"mean":11.491478350515,"rank":1813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1941,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":10.816638297872,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/749875480774402048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9217397],"posted_on":"2016-07-04T08:00:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"749875480774402048"}]}}
