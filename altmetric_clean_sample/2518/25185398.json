Serum Cbl and serum and urine MMA concentrations were determined prospectively in cats at enrollment (t0), immediately before (t6), and 4 (t10) and 10\u00a0weeks (t16) after 6th Cbl injection (250\u00a0\u03bcg, IM q 7\u00a0days). Clinical signs severity (activity, appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, body weight) graded at each time point and expressed as clinical disease activity score.\nClinical disease activity score decreased during supplementation and increased after treatment discontinuation. Median serum Cbl concentration increased significantly from t0 (111\u00a0pmol\/L, range 111-212) to t6 (2,332.5\u00a0pmol\/L, range 123-22,730) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Values at t10 were 610.5\u00a0pmol\/L (range, 111-2,527) and 180.5\u00a0pmol\/L (range, 111-2,262) at t16 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Median baseline serum MMA concentration (372\u00a0\u03bcmol\/L, range 0.39-147,000) decreased significantly to 1.62\u00a0\u03bcmol\/L (range, 0.18-806) at t6 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and gradually increased to 5.34\u00a0\u03bcmol\/L (range, 0.13-1,730) at t10 and 189\u00a0\u03bcmol\/L (range, 0.4-983) at t16. Similar, nonsignificant, pattern observed for urine MMA concentration. Serum and urine MMA concentrations had not normalized in 12 and 6 cats, respectively, at t6.\nThe Cbl supplementation protocol used here did not lead to complete normalization of cellular Cbl deficiency in all examined cats, and biochemical improvements were transient.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004131","authors":["Kempf, J.","Hersberger, M.","Melliger, R.H.","Reusch, C.E.","Kook, P.H."],"doi":"10.1111\/jvim.14830","first_seen_on":"2017-09-13T09:51:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0891-6640","1939-1676","08916640"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1505305828,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvim.14830\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvim.14830\/abstract;jsessionid=31E96B922C186F7E091E73A10156DCF7.f02t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvim.14830\/pdf","pmid":"28895200","pubdate":"2017-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Effects of 6\u00a0Weeks of Parenteral Cobalamin Supplementation on Clinical and Biochemical Variables in Cats with Gastrointestinal Disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-6weeks-parenteral-cobalamin-supplementation-clinical-biochemical-variables-cats-gastrointest"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409376,"mean":7.0790526953473,"rank":6381673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1141424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409376,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125623,"mean":11.72143166006,"rank":87981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125623,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1207,"mean":3.0164245439469,"rank":620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1207,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.7116666666667,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
