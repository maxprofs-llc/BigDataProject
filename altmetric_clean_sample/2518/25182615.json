Recent studies have suggested that corvids may be an important host for Plasmodium spp. and Leucocytozoon spp.\nTo investigate the diversity of Haemosporida of resident carrion crows (Corvus corone) and Eurasian Magpies (Pica pica) in southwest Germany, 100 liver samples of corvids were examined using a nested PCR method to amplify a 1063\u00a0bp fragment of the haemosporidian mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The phylogenetic relationship of parasite lineages obtained from these birds was inferred.\nHaemosporidian DNA was detected in 85 carrion crows (89.5%) and in all five Eurasian Magpies. The most abundant parasite genus was Leucocytozoon with a prevalence of 85.3% (n\u00a0=\u00a095). 65.3% of the samples (n\u00a0=\u00a062) contained multiple infections. Thirteen haemosporidian lineages were isolated from the corvid samples. Female carrion crows were more likely infected with haemosporidian parasites than males.\nThis study provides the first insight into the diversity of haemosporidian parasites of corvids in Germany. Very high prevalences were found and based on the applied diagnostic method also a high amount of multiple infections could be detected. Due to the high diversity of haemosporidian parasites found in corvids, they seem to be excellent model organisms to test species deliminations in haemosporidian parasites.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","authors":["Sandrine Schmid","Katrin Fachet","Anke Dinkel","Ute Mackenstedt","Friederike Woog"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12936-017-2023-5","first_seen_on":"2017-09-13T08:43:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1475-2875"],"issue":"1","journal":"Malaria Journal","last_mentioned_on":1505389091,"links":["https:\/\/malariajournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12936-017-2023-5?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28899382?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28899382?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/malariajournal.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12936-017-2023-5?site=malariajournal.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC5596962","pmid":"28899382","pubdate":"2017-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"369","title":"Carrion crows (Corvus corone) of southwest Germany: important hosts for haemosporidian parasites","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carrion-crows-corvus-corone-southwest-germany-important-hosts-haemosporidian-parasites"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":2.6,"3m":2.6,"1m":2.6,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414430,"mean":7.0825007427048,"rank":3413565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4974751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414430,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128557,"mean":11.779337191574,"rank":43384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":84414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128557,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2958,"mean":5.0822921880284,"rank":1382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2958,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":5.4582133333333,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
