Postoperatively, children with cyanotic lesions showed a deterioration in performance and achieved significantly lower scores than those with acyanotic lesions. While there were significant differences between the congenital heart disease and bone marrow transplantation groups preoperatively, these were no longer apparent at follow up.\nIn contrast to previously published findings, the present results suggest that cardiac surgery does not result in early postoperative improvements in cognitive function for children with congenital heart disease. The nature of the cardiac lesion continues to affect cognitive and academic performance, even after surgery.","authors":["J Wray","T Sensky"],"doi":"10.1136\/heart.85.6.687","first_seen_on":"2017-09-13T09:43:33+00:00","issns":["00070769","1468-201X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Heart","last_mentioned_on":1280188800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/heart.85.6.687"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/heart.bmj.com\/content\/heartjnl\/85\/6\/687.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1729789","pmid":"11359753","pubdate":"2001-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","startpage":"687","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Congenital heart disease and cardiac surgery in childhood: effects on cognitive function and academic ability","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/congenital-heart-disease-cardiac-surgery-childhood-effects-cognitive-function-academic-ability-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
