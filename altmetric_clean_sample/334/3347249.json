We studied the effect of HIV-1 gp120 envelope gene expression on tubular cell apoptosis. HIV-1 gp120 was expressed in a lentiviral vector pHR-CMV-IRES2-EGFP-DeltaB. This plasmid construct was used to produce pseudotyped virus using VSV-G envelope to enhance the tropism for efficient viral transduction. Human proximal tubular (HK-2) cells were transduced and assayed for cellular injury by trypan blue exclusion, Hoechst and PI staining, TUNEL, and cell cycle staging. HIV-1 gp120-transduced HK-2 cells showed cellular injury in a time-dependent manner. Gp120-transduced cells showed 2.5-fold greater apoptosis when compared with vector-transduced cells. Cell cycle analysis did not reveal any alteration between gp120-transduced cells and vector-transduced cells. Gp120-transduced cells showed higher expression of both Fas and FasL, whereas pretreatment with anti-FasL antibody partially inhibited gp120-induced tubular cell apoptosis. Similarly, pretreatment with caspase-8 inhibitor attenuated gp120-induced HK2 cell apoptosis. Moreover, gp120-transduced cells showed activation of caspase 8. These results suggest that HIV-1 gp120 expression induces tubular cell apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway by enhancing Fas and FasL expression and activation of caspase-8.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5323cf058f610004492","doi":"10.1080\/08860220902780101","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T15:12:10+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Renal Failure","last_mentioned_on":1289639161,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/08860220902780101","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19462280"],"pmid":"19462280","pubdate":"2009-05-22T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Tubular cell HIV-1 gp120 expression induces caspase 8 activation and apoptosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tubular-cell-hiv1-gp120-expression-induces-caspase-8-activation-apoptosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635015,"mean":4.9193540767705,"rank":815907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635015,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94689,"mean":8.1524082249072,"rank":24672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94689,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182,"mean":2.1072375690608,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.81785714285714,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
