The \"Perceptron\" examined sequences as linear representations. The \"Perceptron\" is more successful at finding gene beginnings than our previous searches using \"rules\" (see previous paper). We note that the weighting function can find translational initiation sites within sequences that were not included in the training set.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Gary D.
