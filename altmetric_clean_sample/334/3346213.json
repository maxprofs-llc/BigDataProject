The text derives its significance from the fact that it is the only published text in which Linnaeus engaged in an explicit discussion of his taxonomic method. Most importantly, it shows that Linnaeus was clearly aware that a classification of what he called 'natural genera' could not be achieved by a top-down approach of logical division, but had to rely on inductive, bottom-up procedures. The translation is supplemented by explanatory notes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610002001","doi":"10.1016\/j.shpsc.2007.06.003","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T14:43:46+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Studies in History & Philosophy of Biological & Biomedical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1291128186,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.shpsc.2007.06.003"],"pmid":"17893065","pubdate":"2007-09-26T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["ethics","socialsciences","historyofmedicine"],"title":"A translation of Carl Linnaeus's introduction to Genera plantarum (1737).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/translation-carl-linnaeuss-introduction-genera-plantarum-1737"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626012,"mean":4.9497445252532,"rank":817916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626012,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93343,"mean":8.0114378307729,"rank":24105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93343,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":3.3396,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
