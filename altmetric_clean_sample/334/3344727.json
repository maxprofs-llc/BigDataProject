Both partners of 96 married couples completed daily diaries assessing self-disclosure, partner disclosure, perceived partner responsiveness, and intimacy on each of 42 consecutive days. Multivariate multilevel modeling revealed that self-disclosure and partner disclosure both significantly and uniquely contributed to the contemporaneous prediction of intimacy. Perceived partner responsiveness partially mediated the effects of self-disclosure and partner disclosure on intimacy. Global marital satisfaction, relationship intimacy, and demand-withdraw communication were related to daily levels of intimacy. Implications for the importance of perceived partner responsiveness in the intimacy process for married partners are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002da3","authors":["Laurenceau JP","Barrett LF","Rovine MJ"],"doi":"10.1037\/0893-3200.19.2.314","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T14:05:46+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Family Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1439122150,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037\/0893-3200.19.2.314","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15982109"],"pmid":"15982109","pubdate":"2005-06-28T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The interpersonal process model of intimacy in marriage: a daily-diary and multilevel modeling approach.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interpersonal-process-model-intimacy-marriage-dailydiary-multilevel-modeling-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5462231,"mean":6.3515210593466,"rank":1149281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":4304832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5462231,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188943,"mean":8.7263031724023,"rank":46890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":141707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188943,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":476,"mean":7.9871957894737,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":476,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.1272727272727,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":24,"Student  > Ph.
