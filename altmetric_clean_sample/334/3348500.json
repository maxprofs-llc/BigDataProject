For mutational analysis of IL2RG in males with SCID, SSCP screening was followed by DNA sequencing. Of 40 IL2RG mutations found in unrelated SCID patients, 6 were point mutations at the CpG dinucleotide at cDNA 690-691, encoding amino acid R226. This residue lies in the extracellular domain of the protein in a region not previously recognized to be significantly conserved in the cytokine receptor gene family, 11 amino acids upstream from the highly conserved WSXWS motif. Three additional instances of mutation at another CpG dinucleotide at cDNA 879 produced a premature termination signal in the intracellular domain of IL2RG, resulting in loss of the SH2-homologous intracellular domain known to be essential for signaling from the IL-2 receptor complex. Mutations at these two hotspots constitute > 20% of the X-linked SCID mutations found by our group and a similar proportion of all reported IL2RG mutations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["A E Pepper","R H Buckley","T N Small","J M Puck","Pepper, A E","Buckley, R H","Small, T N","Puck, J M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T15:43:12+00:00","issns":["0002-9297"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1290261649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7668284","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1801277"],"pmcid":"PMC1801277","pmid":"7668284","pubdate":"1995-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Two mutational hotspots in the interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain gene causing human X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-mutational-hotspots-interleukin2-receptor-gamma-chain-gene-causing-human-xlinked-severe-combined"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3992024,"mean":5.0370515321327,"rank":917040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3992024,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124124,"mean":9.0119505961974,"rank":37422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124124,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3041,"mean":6.5503435340573,"rank":990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3041,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":19.649,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
