Mutation of this residue to Ala and Gly is here found to increase activity 11- to 18-fold and 21- to 30-fold, respectively, toward dinucleotide, polynucleotide, and cyclic nucleotide substrates, but without changing specificity. The enhanced activity of Q117G toward CpA is due to a 5-fold decrease in Km and a 6-fold increase in kcat. Its Ki value for 2'-CMP is 5-fold lower than that of native angiogenin, whereas its Ki value for 5'-AMP is unchanged. It has been reported previously that mutating Asp-116 to Ala increases activity 15-fold. The double mutant D116A\/Q117A is shown to be only slightly more active than each individual mutant. The present results demonstrate that Gln-117 impedes the ribonucleolytic activity of angiogenin, as predicted by x-ray crystallography. Moreover, they suggest that prior to or during catalysis angiogenin must undergo a conformational change to reorient the C-terminal segment that contains this residue, and that a similar reorganization is required for the mutants as well. This view is supported by molecular modeling of an angiogenin-uridine vanadate complex. These in vitro findings have implications for the angiogenic activity of angiogenin in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1994PNAS...91.2920R","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["N Russo","R Shapiro","K R Acharya","J F Riordan","B L Vallee"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.91.8.2920","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T15:17:59+00:00","issns":["1091-6490"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1403083147,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.91.8.2920"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/91\/8\/2920.full.pdf","pmid":"8159680","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Role of glutamine-117 in the ribonucleolytic activity of human angiogenin.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-glutamine117-ribonucleolytic-activity-human-angiogenin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3906349,"mean":5.0256796475453,"rank":899346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2483166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3906349,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120918,"mean":9.0319763797112,"rank":35957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":83055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120918,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35263,"mean":13.873958529529,"rank":13809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":14425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35263,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":954,"mean":39.806642182581,"rank":586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":954,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
