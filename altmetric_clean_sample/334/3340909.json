We investigated the intracellular distribution of the human GR (hGR) expressed in COS-7 cells, by a different immunohistochemical technique involving immunostaining of cell pellet sections, thus avoiding the use of cell permeabilizing agents and allowing rigorous comparison between successive experiments. With a large set of hGR mutants, we could define determinants of the hGR nuclear localization and compare them with those previously reported for rGR. Our study demonstrated two hormone-dependent nuclear localization signals. NL1 activity, overlapping the DNA-binding domain (DBD)-hinge boundary, was repressed by the unliganded ligand-binding domain (LBD), even if the repressed NL1 retained a residual potency to target hGR in the nucleus. Structure\/function analysis suggested a bipartite structure of NL1, analogous to that of other nuclear targeting signals (the carboxy-terminal part of DBD between amino acids 478 and 487 and the beginning of the hinge region which includes a basic amino acid stretch between 491 and 498). Upon hormone binding, NL2, located in the LBD, was activated, but was unable by itself to sustain full nuclear localization, which required the derepressed NL1 activity. Only two sequences in the LBD, localized between amino acids 600 and 626 and from amino acid 696 up to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid 777, respectively, were found to inhibit NL1 activity. As previously reported, efficient nuclear retention, mandatory for gene expression, did not required DNA-binding activity. The controversial intracellular localization of the unliganded form of hGR and the role of hsp90 in cytoplasmic localization are further discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002890","authors":["F Cadepond","J M Gasc","F Delahaye","N Jibard","G Schweizer-Groyer","I Segard-Maurel","R Evans","E E Baulieu"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T12:17:39+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0014-4827"],"issue":"1","journal":"Experimental Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1195444314,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1612132"],"pmid":"1612132","pubdate":"1992-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Hormonal regulation of the nuclear localization signals of the human glucocorticosteroid receptor.","type":"article","volume":"201","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hormonal-regulation-nuclear-localization-signals-human-glucocorticosteroid-receptor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9279282509359,"rank":815429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92005,"mean":7.1260953871571,"rank":23297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":67632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92005,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1023,"mean":2.2624911937378,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1023,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.23125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
