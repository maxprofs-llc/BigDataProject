We investigated the effect of histamine on the expression of LOX-1 in cells of the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. Histamine as well as forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2-cAMP) stimulated the THP-1 monocytes to express the LOX-1 gene at the transcription level. This histamine effect on LOX-1 gene expression, via the histamine H2 receptor-mediated cAMP signal transduction pathway, was reduced after differentiation of the cells into macrophages, even though forskolin and Bt2-cAMP still enhanced the gene expression. The alteration of the responsiveness of LOX-1 expression to histamine was related to suppressed expression of the H2 receptor in THP-1 macrophages. The switch of the predominant class of histamine receptors between H1 and H2 would modulate the effects of histamine on LOX-1 gene expression in monocytes and macrophages, and therefore, would play a certain role in the inflammatory aspects of atherogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["Tanimoto, A","Murata, Y","Nomaguchi, M","Kimura, S","Arima, N","Xu, H","Hamada, T","Sasaguri, Y"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0014-5793(01)03073-3","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T12:07:00+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0014-5793"],"issue":"3","journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1196318524,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0014-5793(01)03073-3","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11728449"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.febsletters.org\/article\/S0014579301030733\/pdf","pmid":"11728449","pubdate":"2001-11-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Histamine increases the expression of LOX-1 via H2 receptor in human monocytic THP-1 cells.","type":"article","volume":"508","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histamine-increases-expression-lox1-via-h2-receptor-human-monocytic-thp1-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629051,"mean":4.9368884016521,"rank":816638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629051,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93866,"mean":8.0789451233156,"rank":24300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93866,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3393,"mean":2.6191898584906,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3393,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.4232142857143,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
