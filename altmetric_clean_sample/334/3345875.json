Despite the ubiquitous nature of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and its demonstrated role in the modulation of phenotypes resulting from selected nonsense alleles, very little is known regarding its basic mechanism or the selective pressure for complete evolutionary conservation of this function. This review will present the current models of NMD that have been generated during the study of model organisms and mammalian cells. The physiological burden of nonsense transcripts and the emerging view that NMD plays a broad and critical role in the regulation of gene expression will also be discussed. Such issues are relevant to the proposal that pharmacological manipulation of NMD will find therapeutic application.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000767c","authors":["Pamela A.
