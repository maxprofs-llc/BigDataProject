We used multiple techniques to demonstrate a disulfide bonding pattern for hepcidin different from that previously published. All techniques confirmed the following disulfide bond connectivity: Cys(1)-Cys(8), Cys(3)-Cys(6), Cys(2)-Cys(4), and Cys(5)-Cys(7). NMR studies reveal a new model for hepcidin that, at ambient temperatures, interconverts between two different conformations, which could be individually resolved by temperature variation. Using these methods, the solution structure of hepcidin was determined at 325 and 253 K in supercooled water. X-ray analysis of a co-crystal with Fab appeared to stabilize a hepcidin conformation similar to the high temperature NMR structure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["John B.
