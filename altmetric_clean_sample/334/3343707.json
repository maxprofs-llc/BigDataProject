In the green plant lineage, the Chlorophyta encode EFL except Acetabularia where EF-1alpha is found, and the Streptophyta possess EF-1alpha except Mesostigma, which has EFL. These results raise questions about evolutionary patterns of gain and loss of EF-1alpha and EFL. A previous study launched the hypothesis that EF-1alpha was the primitive state and that EFL was gained once in the ancestor of the green plants, followed by differential loss of EF-1alpha or EFL in the principal clades of the Viridiplantae. In order to gain more insight in the distribution of EF-1alpha and EFL in green plants and test this hypothesis we screened the presence of the genes in a large sample of green algae and analyzed their gain-loss dynamics in a maximum likelihood framework using continuous-time Markov models.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b5","authors":["Ellen Cocquyt","Heroen Verbruggen","Frederik Leliaert","Frederick W Zechman","Koen Sabbe","Olivier De Clerck"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2148-9-39","first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T13:36:50+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-691533","handles":["1854\/LU-691533"],"issns":["1471-2148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1237718233,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/9\/39","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2148-9-39","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19216746","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2652445","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2148-9-39"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2148-9-39.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2652445","pmid":"19216746","pubdate":"2009-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Systematics\/Taxonomy\/Biogeography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics and Population Dynamics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"39","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Gain and loss of elongation factor genes in green algae","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2148-9-39","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gain-loss-elongation-factor-genes-green-algae-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9199904968162,"rank":815910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2296295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94627,"mean":8.1544002916747,"rank":24653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94627,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1196,"mean":6.4848853556485,"rank":470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1196,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":10.349804878049,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
