We have studied the differentiation of European cattle by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting. Combining AFLP data sets from two laboratories yielded 81 biallelic polymorphic markers scored in 19-22 individual animals from 51 breeds. Model-based clustering differentiated Podolian cattle as well as French and Alpine breeds from other European cattle. AFLP genetic distances correlated well with microsatellite-based genetic distances calculated for the same breeds. However, the AFLP data emphasized the divergence of taurine and indicine cattle relative to the variation among European breeds and indicated an Eastern influence on Italian and Hungarian Podolian breeds. This probably reflects import from the East after the original introduction of domestic cattle into Europe. Our data suggest that Italian cattle breeds are relatively diverse at the DNA sequence level.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000225b","authors":["Negrini, R.","Nijman, I.
