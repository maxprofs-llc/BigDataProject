By introducing guest molecules into the resulting composite chiral nanochannels, we explore the structures and functionality of the ordered guest\/host LC complex, verifying the smectic-like positional order of the fluidic nematic LC phase, which is obtained by the combination of the LC organization and the nanoporous AAO superstructure. The guest nematic LC 4'-n-pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl is found to form a distinctive fluid layered ordered LC complex at the nanofilament\/guest interface with the host 1,3-phenylene bis[4-(4-nonyloxyphenyliminomethyl)benzoate], where this interface contacts the AAO cylinder wall. Filament growth form is strongly influenced by mixture parameters and pore dimensions.","altmetric_jid":"552536762a83eec8018b456b","authors":["Hanim Kim","Seong Ho Ryu","Michael Tuchband","Tae Joo Shin","Eva Korblova","David M.
