However, highly porous scaffolds do not allow a nondestructive evaluation of the cell number. Our objective was to develop a nondestructive method for human mesenchymal stem cells dose evaluation in a highly porous scaffold for bone regeneration.\nProliferation trend of human mesenchymal stem cells on Biocoral(\u00ae) scaffolds was measured by a resazurin-based assay here optimized for 3D cultures. The method allows to noninvasively follow the cell proliferation on biocorals over 3 weeks with very high reproducibility.\nThis reliable method could be a powerful tool in cell-based therapies for cell dose determination.","altmetric_jid":"5587ebb72a83ee287f8b4567","authors":["Carla Divieto","Maria Paola Sassi"],"doi":"10.4155\/fso.15.58","first_seen_on":"2015-09-10T09:30:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-5623"],"issue":"4","journal":"Future Science OA","last_mentioned_on":1442477556,"links":["http:\/\/www.future-science.com\/doi\/full\/10.4155\/fso.15.58"],"pmcid":"PMC5137907","pmid":"28031911","pubdate":"2015-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"150907045205009","title":"A first approach to evaluate the cell dose in highly porous scaffolds by using a nondestructive metabolic method","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/first-approach-evaluate-cell-dose-highly-porous-scaffolds-using-nondestructive-metabolic-method"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6976010,"mean":6.2349785729896,"rank":3236555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3556406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6976010,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225285,"mean":8.956865680652,"rank":105239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":110198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225285,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":8.2584489795918,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":8.7868148148148,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
