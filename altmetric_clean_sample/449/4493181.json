Although several studies have investigated associated patient characteristics, the emerging findings from genetic studies offer further scope for study.\nIn 612 schizophrenia patients with detailed clinical information, common genetic variants indexed by polygenic risk scores, and rare variants indexed by deletion and duplication burden genomewide, we explored potential genetic predictors alongside other established risk factors for treatment resistance. Clinical outcomes of treatment resistance were also calculated using lifetime measures of positive, negative\/disorganized and mood symptoms as well as number of hospitalizations and suicide attempts.\nLogistic regression models identified a significant relationship between treatment resistance and total duplication burden genomewide, years of formal schooling and age at onset. Clinically, treatment-resistant patients were characterized by greater negative\/disorganized and positive symptoms and greater number of hospitalizations.\nTaken together, these findings suggest genetic information, specifically the genomewide burden of rare copy number variants, may increase our understanding and clinical management of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d9","authors":["Martin, A K","Mowry, B"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0033291715001701","first_seen_on":"2015-09-10T10:28:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-8978"],"issue":"03","journal":"Psychological Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1450710649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26349998?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26349998","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10080599&utm_source=Issue_Alert&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=PSM"],"pmid":"26349998","pubdate":"2015-09-10T22:01:27+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Increased rare duplication burden genomewide in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-rare-duplication-burden-genomewide-patients-treatmentresistant-schizophrenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7910068,"mean":6.6936968994011,"rank":3048184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4827903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7910068,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229672,"mean":9.1030600119301,"rank":71405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":156812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229672,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2812,"mean":9.6432287442191,"rank":1682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2812,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":10.257882352941,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
