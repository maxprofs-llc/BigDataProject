Logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of perceived neighborhood order and disorder on the likelihood of achieving biochemically verified point prevalence and continuous smoking abstinence 4 weeks following a scheduled quit attempt. Analyses were adjusted for demographic characteristics, cigarettes per day, intervention group, and pharmacological treatment.\nParticipants were primarily non-White (72.7%) and female (56.8%) with a mean age of 52.5 (SD=3.7) years. Most reported an annual household income of \u2264$25,000 (86.3%). Logistic regression analyses indicated that greater neighborhood physical (p=.048) and social order (p=.039) were associated with a greater likelihood of achieving point prevalence smoking abstinence at 4 weeks post-quit. Greater perceived physical (p=.035) and social disorder (p=.039) and total neighborhood disorder (p=.014), were associated with a reduced likelihood of achieving point prevalence abstinence. Social disorder (p=.040) was associated with a reduced likelihood of achieving continuous abstinence at 4 weeks post-quit, while social order (p=.020) was associated with an increased likelihood of continuous abstinence.\nPerceptions of neighborhood order and disorder were associated with the likelihood of smoking cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers making a quit attempt. Findings highlight the need to address perceptions of the neighborhood environment among disadvantaged smokers seeking treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002732","authors":["Ma, Ping","Businelle, Michael S","Balis, David S","Kendzor, Darla E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.drugalcdep.2015.09.004","first_seen_on":"2015-09-12T00:16:46+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["0376-8716","1879-0046"],"journal":"Drug & Alcohol Dependence","last_mentioned_on":1442016982,"links":["http:\/\/www.drugandalcoholdependence.com\/article\/S0376-8716(15)01630-0\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.drugandalcoholdependence.com\/article\/S0376871615016300\/pdf","pmid":"26386824","pubdate":"2015-09-21T22:00:13+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"The Influence of Perceived Neighborhood Disorder on Smoking Cessation among Urban Safety Net Hospital Patients","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-perceived-neighborhood-disorder-smoking-cessation-among-urban-safety-net-hospital-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6327010,"mean":5.8270013489786,"rank":4672627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":938427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6327010,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194836,"mean":9.751674873611,"rank":134124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":38992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194836,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2118,"mean":8.8501162021729,"rank":1614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2118,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":7.1362448979592,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
