We aim to investigate the association between chronic steroid use and postoperative complications after colorectal surgery.\nThe National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to examine the clinical data of patients undergoing colorectal resection during 2005 to 2013. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to investigate outcomes of patients with chronic steroid use.\nWe sampled a total of 147,121 patients who underwent colorectal resection. Of these, 11,195 (7.6%) had a history of chronic steroid use. Patients who had chronic steroid use had a higher risk of preoperative sepsis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.41, P < .01), hypoalbuminemia (AOR: 1.49, P < .01), bleeding disorders (AOR: 1.54, P < .01), and diabetes (AOR: 1.11, P = .01). Chronic steroid use was associated with a significant increase in the mortality and morbidity of patients (AOR: 1.56 and 1.25, respectively, P < .01).\nPatients with a chronic steroid use have a high risk of preoperative malnutrition, diabetes, bleeding disorders, and sepsis. A history of chronic steroid use was associated with a significant increase in the mortality and morbidity of patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","authors":["Moghadamyeghaneh, Zhobin","Hanna, Mark H","Blondet, Juan J","Carmichael, Joseph C","Mills, Steven D","Pigazzi, Alessio","Stamos, Michael J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjsurg.2015.07.002","first_seen_on":"2015-09-12T05:46:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00029610","1879-1883"],"journal":"American Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1442036800,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0002961015004730&_version=1&md5=c86fa322803fc0b15efe0af0bf3ace5d"],"pmid":"26460057","pubdate":"2015-10-16T22:04:16+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Impact of Chronic Steroid Use on Outcomes of Colorectal Surgery ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-chronic-steroid-outcomes-colorectal-surgery-presented-oral-presentation-southwestern-surgical"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6330141,"mean":5.8293205110783,"rank":5391566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6330141,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194892,"mean":9.7533841685865,"rank":155903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194892,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1530,"mean":2.3696429038587,"rank":1090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1530,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":2.0311,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SurgeryScience\/statuses\/642575032464470016","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4499341],"posted_on":"2015-09-12T05:46:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Surgical Research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/552556384688939009\/rWmyj-8R_normal.jpeg","description":"Latest surgical research journal papers as they're published | Academic updates and CME | @DrEdFitzgerald","id_on_source":"SurgeryScience","tweeter_id":"2707749445","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2374},"tweet_id":"642575032464470016"}]}}
