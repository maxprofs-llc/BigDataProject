In yeast, TORC1 coordinates growth with G1-S cell cycle progression, also coined as START, by favouring the expression of G1 cyclins that activate cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) and by destabilizing the CDK inhibitor Sic1. Following TORC1 downregulation by rapamycin treatment or nutrient limitation, clearance of G1 cyclins and C-terminal phosphorylation of Sic1 by unknown protein kinases are both required for Sic1 to escape ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis prompted by its flagging via the SCF(Cdc4) (Skp1\/Cul1\/F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. Here we show that the stabilizing phosphorylation event within the C-terminus of Sic1 requires stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, Mpk1, and inhibition of the Cdc55 protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A(Cdc55)) by greatwall kinase-activated endosulfines. Thus, Mpk1 and the greatwall kinase pathway serve TORC1 to coordinate the phosphorylation status of Sic1 and consequently START with nutrient availability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Marta Moreno-Torres","Malika Jaquenoud","Claudio De Virgilio"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms9256","first_seen_on":"2015-09-10T10:43:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1733","2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1444397749,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/150910\/ncomms9256\/full\/ncomms9256.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26356805?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26356805","pubdate":"2015-09-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"title":"TORC1 controls G1-S cell cycle transition in yeast via Mpk1 and the greatwall kinase pathway.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/torc1-controls-g1s-cell-cycle-transition-yeast-via-mpk1-greatwall-kinase-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6243623,"mean":5.956522162939,"rank":2300188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3852274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6243623,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185045,"mean":9.9385970904218,"rank":70870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":110606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185045,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9687,"mean":37.64732603758,"rank":6884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":2603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9687,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":708,"mean":43.166973125884,"rank":532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":708,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
