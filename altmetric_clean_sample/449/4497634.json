Few studies have assessed this issue.\nIn this retrospective chart review, we analyzed data on MFs and NMFs of 175 patients, including 54 ET\u2192PD and 121 ET, actively followed in the Athens University 1st Neurology Department.\nSignificantly more ET\u2192PD than ET patients reported asymmetric tremor at ET onset (68.5% vs. 14.9%, p<0.001). Significantly more ET than ET\u2192PD patients had head tremor (43.5% vs. 13.2%, p<0.001) and cerebellar signs (41.3% vs. 9.3%, p<0.001). More ET than ET\u2192PD patients reported hearing impairment (65.3% vs. 28.3%, p<0.001) and restless legs syndrome (34.8% vs. 3.7%, p<0.001). Conversely, a larger proportion of ET\u2192PD than ET patients reported rapid eye movement behavior disorder (51.9% vs. 10.0%, p<0.001), constipation (67.9% vs. 36.4%, p<0.001), and olfactory dysfunction (83.3% vs. 36.4%, p<0.001).\nThe subset of ET\u2192PD patients may have distinct MFs and NMFs that should be assessed further for the possible predictive value for the emergence of PD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90f3cf058f61000cc52","authors":["Apostolia Ghika","Andreas Kyrozis","Constantinos Potagas","Elan D.
