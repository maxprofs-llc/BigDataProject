Small tissue samples are particularly problematic, with limitations that include volume of tumor cells available for studies, lack of architectural context and a non-specific gross description. Incorporation of patient history and presentation, radiologic findings, clinical impression and concurrent studies often guide the course of studies performed by the pathologist. If these are non-specific, the pathologist may need to perform ancillary studies, including a broad panel of immunohistochemical stains and molecular studies. If tissue is limited, a precise classification may not be achievable. Although the expectation to render a definitive diagnosis is high, the pathologist should never feel compelled to go further with a diagnosis than the tissue itself supports.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088f4","authors":["Simons, Stacey A","Bridge, Julia A","Leon, Marino E"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.semdp.2015.09.010","first_seen_on":"2015-09-10T00:28:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0740-2570"],"journal":"Seminars in Diagnostic Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1441920751,"links":["http:\/\/www.semdiagpath.com\/article\/S0740-2570(15)00132-X\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.semdiagpath.com\/article\/S074025701500132X\/pdf","pmid":"26585346","pubdate":"2015-11-21T22:01:17+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Sinonasal Small Round Blue Cell Tumors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sinonasal-small-round-blue-cell-tumors-approach-diagnosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8385771,"mean":7.0648468433947,"rank":2045626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6319073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8385771,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232675,"mean":9.2751065095369,"rank":64683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":167035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232675,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":328,"mean":3.3141590214067,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":328,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.7777777777778,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
