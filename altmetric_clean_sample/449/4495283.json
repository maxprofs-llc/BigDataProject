Pulmonic stenosis was the most common defect followed by patent ductus arteriosus, aortic stenosis, and ventricular septal defect. Among mixed-breed cats, prevalence of CHD was 0.14% (55.2% male) and of innocent murmurs was 0.16% (54.4% male). When the 25 cats with dynamic left or right ventricular outflow obstruction were counted with cases of innocent murmurs, the overall prevalence was 0.2%. Ventricular septal defects were the most common feline CHD followed closely by aortic stenosis and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. There was no overall sex predilection for CHD in mixed-breed cats or dogs, and no significant difference in CHD prevalence between cats or dogs. Among dogs, subvalvular aortic stenosis and mitral valve dysplasia had a male predisposition while patent ductus arteriosus had a female predisposition. Among cats, valvular pulmonic stenosis, subvalvular and valvular aortic stenosis, and ventricular septal defects had a male predisposition while pulmonary artery stenosis had a female predisposition.\nThe prevalence of CHD in a mixed-breed dogs and cats is lower than for prior studies, perhaps due to the lack of purebreds in the study population or actual changes in disease prevalence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1c","authors":["Schrope, Donald P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvc.2015.06.001","first_seen_on":"2015-09-10T20:01:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["17602734","1875-0834"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1441915255,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1760273415000466"],"pmid":"26363941","pubdate":"2015-09-14T22:00:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Prevalence of congenital heart disease in 76,301 mixed-breed dogs and 57,025 mixed-breed cats ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-congenital-heart-disease-76301-mixedbreed-dogs-57025-mixedbreed-cats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6330141,"mean":5.8293205110783,"rank":5391563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6330141,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194343,"mean":9.6770675201449,"rank":155558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194343,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":0.60509677419355,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.64166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
