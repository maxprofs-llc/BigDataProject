The DC-SIGN receptor is encoded by the gene CD209 and is expressed on the surface of DCs. It binds to mannose-rich carbohydrates and enables the recognition of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. SNP -336A\/G in the promoter region of CD209 influences the expression of the DC-SIGN receptor. Several studies have associated this SNP with an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases and the development of more severe forms of disease. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of SNP -336A\/G in a population from northeastern Brazil. We analyzed 181 individuals from the general population of Parna\u00edba, Piau\u00ed, Brazil, of which 37% were men and 63% were women. SNP -336A\/G was detected by polymerase chain reaction and treatment with the restriction enzyme MscI and visualized by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel stained with silver nitrate. Of the individuals analyzed, 116 (64.1%) were homozygous AA, 57 (31.5%) were heterozygous (AG), and 8 (4.4%) were homozygous GG. The allele frequency of -336G was 20.2%. Genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the frequency of the CD209 SNP -336A\/G in a population in the State of Piau\u00ed. Further studies are needed to determine the relationship between this SNP and the vulnerability of this population to major infectious diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007523","authors":["Costa, P N","Ferreira-Fernandes, H","de Oliveira, J S","Pereira, A C T C","Pinto, G R","Ferreira, G P"],"doi":"10.4238\/2015.august.14.3","first_seen_on":"2015-09-10T01:15:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1676-5680"],"issue":"3","journal":"Genetics and Molecular Research","last_mentioned_on":1441851424,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26345873?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26345873","pubdate":"2015-09-10T22:03:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Frequency of SNP -336A\/G in the promoter region of CD209 in a population from northeastern Brazil.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frequency-snp-336ag-promoter-region-cd209-population-northeastern-brazil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6329979,"mean":5.8290919946321,"rank":2788851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3371065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6329979,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194342,"mean":9.6770524799193,"rank":95416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":90521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194342,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1368,"mean":0.78720117044623,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1368,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":0.62766666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DCell_papers\/statuses\/641781907957542912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4491784],"posted_on":"2015-09-10T01:15:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Dendritic cells","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/444106482712182784\/jm3fnA5u_normal.jpeg","description":"Journal paper feed for academics interested in dendritic cells, immunology and immunity (image source: NIH)","id_on_source":"DCell_papers","tweeter_id":"2386845055","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":247},"tweet_id":"641781907957542912"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/statuses\/641797505601048577","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4491784],"posted_on":"2015-09-10T02:17:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
