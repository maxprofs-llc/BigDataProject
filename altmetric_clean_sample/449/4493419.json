The maximum methane yields of 410, 270, 377 and 323mL CH4\/gVSadded for PM, DM, CM and RM were all obtained at initial VSL of 8gVS\/L, respectively. The improvement of substrate concentration to 64gVS\/L not only decreased the methane yield and biodegradability both by 22.4%, 37.3%, 49.1% and 34.6% for PM, DM, CM and RM respectively, but also reduced the methane content in final biogas production. The Cone model (R(2): 0.9910-0.9974) showed a better fit to the experiment data and the calculated parameters indicated that anaerobic digestion of manures at higher loading has longer lag phase and lower hydrolysis rate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Li, Kun","Liu, Ronghou","Sun, Chen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2015.08.151","first_seen_on":"2015-09-10T11:28:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09608524","1873-2976"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1441884482,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0960852415012675"],"pmid":"26386415","pubdate":"2015-09-20T22:00:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Comparison of anaerobic digestion characteristics and kinetics of four livestock manures with different substrate concentrations ","type":"article","volume":"198","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-anaerobic-digestion-characteristics-kinetics-four-livestock-manures-different-substrate-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6326302,"mean":5.8274056156985,"rank":5388518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6326302,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194289,"mean":9.6753743720662,"rank":155503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194289,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1495,"mean":2.0469317269076,"rank":922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1495,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":0.82733944954128,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
