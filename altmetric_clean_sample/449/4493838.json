The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical significance, biological effects and underlying mechanisms of miR-128 in CRC using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting. It was found that the expression of miR-128 was downregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines as determined by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, the expression of miR-128 in tumor tissues was significantly negatively correlated with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis in CRC patients. Functional assay revealed that the overexpression of miR-128 inhibited CRC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion and promoted apoptosis in\u00a0vitro, and suppressed CRC xenograft tumor growth in\u00a0vivo. In addition, insulin receptor substrate\u00a01 (IRS1), a key mediator in oncogenic insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, was confirmed as a direct target of miR-128 by a luciferase reporter assay. Western blot analysis indicated that the overexpression of miR-128 significantly downregulated IRS1 expression and its downstream Akt signaling in CRC\u00a0cells. Moreover, miR-128 was negatively associated with IRS1 in CRC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Taken together, these data suggested that miR-128 serves as a tumor suppressor and blocks CRC growth and metastasis by targeting IRS1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837e","authors":["Wu, Lan","Shi, Bo","Huang, Kexin","Fan, Guoyu"],"doi":"10.3892\/or.2015.4251","first_seen_on":"2015-09-10T13:14:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-2431"],"journal":"Oncology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1441890873,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26352220?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26352220","pubdate":"2015-09-10T22:00:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MicroRNA-128 suppresses cell growth and metastasis in colorectal carcinoma by targeting IRS1.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna128-suppresses-cell-growth-metastasis-colorectal-carcinoma-targeting-irs1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6330141,"mean":5.8293205110783,"rank":5391562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6330141,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194343,"mean":9.6770693210937,"rank":155557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194343,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1394,"mean":1.6583531945441,"rank":831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1394,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":0.62903225806452,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
