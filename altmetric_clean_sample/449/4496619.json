Income inequality and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has been associated to stroke mortality in developed countries. In LMIC, GDP per capita is considered to be a more relevant health determinant than income inequality. This study aims to investigate if income inequality is associated to stroke mortality in Brazil at large, but also on regional and state levels, and whether GDP per capita modulates the impact of this association.\nStroke mortality rates, Gini index and GDP per capita data were pooled for the 2002 to 2009 period from public available databases. Random effects models were fitted, controlling for GDP per capita and other covariates.\nIncome inequality was independently associated to stroke mortality rates, even after controlling for GDP per capita and other covariates. GDP per capita reduced only partially the impact of income inequality on stroke mortality. A decrease in 10 points in the Gini index was associated with 18% decrease in the stroke mortality rate in Brazil.\nIncome inequality was independently associated to stroke mortality in Brazil.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Natalia Vincens","Martin Stafstr\u00f6m"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0137332","first_seen_on":"2015-09-11T06:21:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1442379973,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0137332","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0137332"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0137332.PDF","pmid":"26352415","pubdate":"2015-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0137332","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Income Inequality, Economic Growth and Stroke Mortality in Brazil: Longitudinal and Regional Analysis 2002-2009","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/income-inequality-economic-growth-stroke-mortality-brazil-longitudinal-regional-analysis-20022009"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6339041,"mean":5.8361081100615,"rank":2160896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4132636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6339041,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194556,"mean":9.7513768857136,"rank":67329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":125387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194556,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96934,"mean":9.672116843593,"rank":35097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":60527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96934,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5884,"mean":8.3875553289138,"rank":2032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5884,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
