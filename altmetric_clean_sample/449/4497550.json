The aim of this study was to investigate dynamical aspects of sleep EEG in PD as compared to healthy controls.\nIn this retrospective, controlled study, we applied a previously established mathematical model of sleep EEG analysis (state space model) to PD patients and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (N=64). Dynamical aspects of sleep were quantified by measuring the spectral variability of the sleep EEG (by means of state space velocity).\nState space analysis revealed preserved global sleep-wake architecture in PD patients, but the velocity of sleep stage transitions was significantly reduced as compared to healthy controls. Correlation analysis revealed a strong association of state space velocity with arousal scores and daily dopamine agonist intake.\nQuantitative analysis of spectral sleep EEG variability (state space velocity) revealed reduced sleep-wake dynamics in PD patients as compared to control subjects.\nWe propose state space velocity as an objective and quantitative measure for altered sleep microstructure and as a potential biomarker of sleep alterations in PD, not accessible by conventional sleep analysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002566","authors":["Imbach, Lukas L","Sommerauer, Michael","Poryazova, Rositsa","Werth, Esther","Valko, Philipp O","Scammell, Thomas E","Baumann, Christian R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clinph.2015.08.012","first_seen_on":"2015-09-11T12:49:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13882457","1872-8952"],"journal":"Clinical Neurophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1441975750,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1388245715007877&_version=1&md5=39d55ad2c9ce88ea8ce6dda3eb6e8dae"],"pmid":"26419612","pubdate":"2015-10-01T22:01:32+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Bradysomnia in Parkinson\u2019s Disease ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bradysomnia-parkinsons-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6327010,"mean":5.8270013489786,"rank":5388684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6327010,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194376,"mean":9.7461579832797,"rank":155578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194376,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1084,"mean":2.4975346260388,"rank":870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.8257058823529,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
