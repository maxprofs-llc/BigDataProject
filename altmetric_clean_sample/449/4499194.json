In particular, many researchers posited a horizontal mental number line, where small numbers are thought of as being to the left of larger numbers. This review synthesizes work on the mental association between space and number, indicating the existence of multiple spatial mappings: Recent research has found associations between number and vertical space, as well as associations between number and near\/far space. We discuss number space in three dimensions with an eye on potential origins of the different number mappings, and how these number mappings fit in with our current knowledge of brain organization and brain-culture interactions. We derive novel predictions and show how this research fits into a general view of cognition as embodied, grounded and situated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ab","authors":["Winter, Bodo","Matlock, Teenie","Shaki, Samuel","Fischer, Martin H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neubiorev.2015.09.005","first_seen_on":"2015-09-12T02:41:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01497634","1873-7528"],"journal":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1443459699,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0149763415002407"],"pmid":"26365108","pubdate":"2015-09-15T22:01:30+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"title":"Mental number space in three dimensions ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mental-number-space-three-dimensions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276087,"mean":6.9819459655139,"rank":3795586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4397736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276087,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232664,"mean":9.3304450041476,"rank":94602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":133759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232664,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1699,"mean":10.414432273263,"rank":1135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1699,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":15.830622222222,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
