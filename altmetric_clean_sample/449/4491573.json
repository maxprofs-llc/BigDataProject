All five U.S. registry-based studies showed that black, Hispanic, and Asian women had lower clinical pregnancy rates and\/or live birth rates after IVF, compared with white women. Similarly, most clinic-specific studies reported significant disparities in these primary outcomes, potentially attributable to differences in infertility diagnosis, spontaneous abortion, and obesity. Studies varied with respect to definitions of race\/ethnicity, inclusion of first cycles vs. multiple cycles for individual women, and collected covariates. Most studies were limited by sample size, inadequate adjustment for confounding, selection bias, and extensive missing data.\nAlthough current evidence points to race and ethnicity, especially black race, as strong predictors of poorer outcomes after in vitro fertilization, the utility of results is constrained by the limitations described.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000570e","authors":["Humphries, Leigh A","Chang, Olivia","Humm, Kathryn","Sakkas, Denny","Hacker, Michele R","Leigh A.
