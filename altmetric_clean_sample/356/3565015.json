To provide clarity on this topic, we reviewed 562 patients diagnosed with MM at our institution. Patients with high-SES had a median OS of 62.8 months (mos) (95% CI 43.1-82.6 mos), compared to 53.7 mos (45.2-62.3 mos) and 48.6 mos (40.4-56.8 mos) for the middle and low-SES, respectively (p =0.015). After controlling for race, age, year of diagnosis, severity of comorbidities, stem cell transplant utilization, and insurance provider, patients with low-SES had a 54 percent increase in mortality rate relative to patients with high-SES. To support our findings, we performed a similar analysis of 45,505 patients with MM from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-18 (SEER) database. Low-SES is independently associated with poorer OS in MM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["Fiala MA","Finney JD","Liu J","Stockerl-Goldstein KE","Tomasson MH","Vij R","Wildes TM"],"doi":"10.3109\/10428194.2015.1011156","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T00:49:37+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Leukemia & Lymphoma","last_mentioned_on":1455042685,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25651424"],"pmid":"25651424","pubdate":"2015-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Socioeconomic Status is Independently Associated with Overall Survival in Patients with Multiple Myeloma.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/socioeconomic-status-independently-associated-overall-survival-patients-multiple-myeloma-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7156405,"mean":6.3086437613049,"rank":3140313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3987455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7156405,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235783,"mean":8.1094857283424,"rank":96283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":138169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235783,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":997,"mean":1.9330763052209,"rank":314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":997,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.2833333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Other":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mtmdphd\/statuses\/697050231465230336","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[3565015],"posted_on":"2016-02-09T13:31:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Mike Thompson, MDPhD","url":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/michaelthompsonmdphd","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2638189364\/9a817b84e5879a81121e476303368366_normal.png","description":"Heme\/Onc Researcher. @Aurora_Cancer Member: @ASCO @ASH_Hematology @Doximity. #mmsm, #lymsm, #ImmunoOnc, #ClinicalTrials Views=own","id_on_source":"mtmdphd","tweeter_id":"190337035","geo":{"lt":43.0389,"ln":-87.90647,"country":"US"},"followers":15274},"tweet_id":"697050231465230336"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrMJoyner\/statuses\/697052005735362564","license":"gnip","rt":["mtmdphd"],"citation_ids":[3565015],"posted_on":"2016-02-09T13:38:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Michael Joyner","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000538811202\/4bbb1ffa48e305e753ac4b3d366e89fb_normal.jpeg","description":"Physiologist & anesthesiologist at Mayo Clinic.
