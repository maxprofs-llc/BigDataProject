However, except for HOM-TES-14\/SCP1, their expression in malignant lymphomas is rare. SCP1 (synaptonemal complex protein 1) has been shown to elicit antibody responses in the autologous host, but no T-cell responses against HOM-TES-14\/SCP1 have been reported. Using the SYFPEITHI algorithm, we selected peptides with a high binding affinity to major histocompatibility complex class 2 (MHC 2) molecules. The pentadecamer epitope p635-649 induced specific CD4+ T-cell responses that were shown to be restricted by HLA-DRB1*1401. The responses could be blocked by preincubation of T cells with anti-CD4 and antigen-presenting cells with anti-HLA-DR, respectively, proving the HLA-DR-restricted presentation of p635-649 and a CD4+ T-cell-mediated effector response. Responding CD4+ cells did not secrete interleukin-5 (IL-5), indicating that they belong to the T(H)1 subtype. The natural processing and presentation of p635-649 were demonstrated by pulsing autologous and allogeneic dendritic cells with a protein fragment covering p635-649. Thus, p635-649 is the first HOM-TES-14\/SCP1-derived epitope to fulfill all prerequisites for use as a peptide vaccine in patients with HOM-TES-14\/SCP1-expressing tumors, which is the case in two thirds of peripheral T-cell lymphomas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Frank Neumann","Claudia Wagner","Klaus-Dieter Preuss","Boris Kubuschok","Claudia Schormann","Stefan Stevanovic","Michael Pfreundschuh"],"doi":"10.1182\/blood-2005-04-1487","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T23:25:59+00:00","issns":["1528-0020"],"journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1207790523,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1182\/blood-2005-04-1487","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16030183"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bloodjournal.org\/content\/bloodjournal\/106\/9\/3105.full.pdf","pmid":"16030183","publisher":"American Society of Hematology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Identification of an epitope derived from the cancer testis antigen HOM-TES-14\/SCP1 and presented by dendritic cells to circulating CD4+ T cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-epitope-derived-cancer-testis-antigen-homtes14scp1-presented-dendritic-cells-circulat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616414,"mean":4.9310398369908,"rank":815285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2277408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616414,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93257,"mean":7.2204470704298,"rank":23647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93257,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6887,"mean":2.7477685158292,"rank":1049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6887,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":4.2852631578947,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
