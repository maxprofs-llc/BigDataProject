A database search revealed that 2P1 was 91% identical to ORF1 of E3-3, a rat gene probably involved in the regulation of alternative splicing. Sequencing showed that 2P1 has a destabilization motif in its 3'-untranslated region. Northern blotting showed strong gene expression in the testis and weak expression in the epididymis, with no signal detected in other tissues. RT-PCR analysis confirmed testis and epididymis expression. In situ hybridization revealed that 2P1 mRNA was absent in spermatogonia but expressed in spermatocytes. This last result was confirmed by RT-PCR of FACS isolated primary spermatocytes (pachytene stage). Using RT-PCR, purified spermatids were also shown to express 2P1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e33","authors":["Sonia Hammami-Hamza","Mireille Doussau","Isabelle Allemand","Dominique Segretain","Jean-Marie Gasc","Catherine Finaz"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T01:33:38+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0214-6282"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Developmental Biology","last_mentioned_on":1207769405,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12653254"],"pmid":"12653254","pubdate":"2003-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"2P1, a novel male mouse cDNA specifically expressed during meiosis.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/2p1-novel-male-mouse-cdna-specifically-expressed-during-meiosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622268,"mean":4.9302137127912,"rank":816091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2283232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622268,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94051,"mean":7.4742837426901,"rank":23952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":69022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94051,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":2.2979480519481,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"C3orf60","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=204519122#altmetric_citation_4","license":"public","citation_ids":[3567134],"posted_on":"2008-04-09T19:30:05+00:00","summary":"NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex assembly factor 3 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the NDUFAF3 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=16848747","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
