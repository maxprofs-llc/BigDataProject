RB101 easily crosses the blood-brain barrier, as shown by the observed complete inhibition of cerebral endopeptidase 24.11 after i.v. injection in mice. The prodrug induces strong, dose-dependent antinociceptive responses in mice after i.v., i.p. or s.c. administration, in the hot plate (ED50 = 9 mg\/kg) and phenylbenzoquinone-induced writhing (ED50-3.25 mg\/kg) tests in mice, which are currently used in analgesics screening. RB101 is also active in the tail-flick and tail-electric stimulation tests in rats. In contrast, under disulfide forms, the above selective aminopeptidase N or endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitors are inactive after i.v. administration and their association 3 times less potent than RB101 alone. In all the tests used, the pain-alleviating effect of RB101 was suppressed by naloxone, but, except for the tail-flick and the motor response to tail-electric stimulation, not by the delta-selective antagonist naltrindole. The preferential involvement of mu opioid receptors in the analgesic effects of endogenous enkephalins, whose extracellular levels are increased by the two RB101-generated inhibitors, is suggested by the similar apparent pA2 values for RB101-naloxone (pA2: 7.53 +\/- 0.046) and DAMGO (mu-selective ligand)-naloxone (pA2: 7.38 +\/- 0.049).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de2","authors":["F Noble","J M Soleilhac","E Soroca-Lucas","S Turcaud","M C Fournie-Zaluski","B P Roques"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T01:22:19+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-3565"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1294354145,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1560364"],"pmid":"1560364","pubdate":"1992-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Inhibition of the enkephalin-metabolizing enzymes by the first systemically active mixed inhibitor prodrug RB 101 induces potent analgesic responses in mice and rats.","type":"article","volume":"261","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-enkephalinmetabolizing-enzymes-first-systemically-active-mixed-inhibitor-prodrug-rb-101-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95576,"mean":8.2381010306045,"rank":24902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95576,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1522,"mean":2.8374056541749,"rank":200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1522,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.7016129032258,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
