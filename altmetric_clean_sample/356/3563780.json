We have designed a peptide, TEAM-VP, composed of two functional domains, one a tumor blood vessel RGD-like 'homing' motif and the other an MMP-inducing sequence derived from Vpr. When added to isolated mitochondria, TEAM-VP interacts with ANT and VDAC, reduces oxygen consumption and overcomes Bcl-2 protection to cause inner and outer MMP. TEAM-VP specifically recognizes cell-surface expressed alpha(V)beta(3) integrins, internalizes, temporarily localizes to lysosomes and progressively co-distributes with the mitochondrial compartment with no sign of lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Finally TEAM-VP reaches mitochondria of angiogenic endothelial cells to induce mitochondrial fission, dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), cytochrome c release and apoptosis hallmarks. Hence, this chimeric peptide constitutes the first example of a virus-derived mitochondriotoxic compound as a candidate to kill selectively tumor neo-endothelia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["A Borgne-Sanchez","A Borgne-Sanchez","S Dupont","A Langonn\u00e9","L Baux","H Lecoeur","D Chauvier","M Lassalle","O D\u00e9as","J-J Bri\u00e8re","M Brabant","P Roux","C P\u00e9choux","J-P Briand","J Hoebeke","A Deniaud","C Brenner","P Rustin","L Edelman","D Rebouillat","E Jacotot"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.cdd.4402018","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T00:26:31+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1207810336,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.cdd.4402018","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16888644"],"pmid":"16888644","pubdate":"2006-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Targeted Vpr-derived peptides reach mitochondria to induce apoptosis of alphaVbeta3-expressing endothelial cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeted-vprderived-peptides-reach-mitochondria-induce-apoptosis-alphavbeta3expressing-endothelial-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":816614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96325,"mean":8.2861461318053,"rank":25238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96325,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":699,"mean":3.6986361031519,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":699,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":10.536490566038,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
