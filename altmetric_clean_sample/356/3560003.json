Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that Kv6.3 was highly expressed in the brain. Electrophysiological studies indicated that homomultimeric Kv6.3 did not yield a functional voltage-gated ion channel. When Kv6.3 and Kv2.1 were co-expressed, the heteromultimeric channels displayed the decreased rate of deactivation compared to the homomultimeric Kv2.1 channels. Immunoprecipitation studies indicated that Kv6.3 bound with Kv2.1 in co-transfected cells. These results indicate that Kv6.3 is a novel member of the voltage-gated K(+) channel which functions as a modulatory subunit.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["Sano, Yorikata","Mochizuki, Shinobu","Miyake, Akira","Kitada, Chika","Inamura, Kohei","Yokoi, Hiromichi","Nozawa, Katsura","Matsushime, Hitoshi","Furuichi, Kiyoshi"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0014-5793(02)02267-6","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T23:15:38+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0014-5793"],"issue":"1-3","journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1215631839,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0014-5793(02)02267-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11852086","http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0014579302022676"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.febsletters.org\/article\/S0014579302022676\/pdf","pmid":"11852086","pubdate":"2002-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Molecular cloning and characterization of Kv6.3, a novel modulatory subunit for voltage-gated K+ channel Kv2.11","type":"article","volume":"512","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-cloning-characterization-kv63-novel-modulatory-subunit-voltagegated-k-channel-kv211"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635017,"mean":4.9194226118571,"rank":815975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635017,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96304,"mean":8.2453186297417,"rank":25186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96304,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3393,"mean":2.6209964622642,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3393,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.3653846153846,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
