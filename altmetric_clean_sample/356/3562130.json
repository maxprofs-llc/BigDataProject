The recent determination of the crystal structure of Epac2 has indicated a mechanism for the activation of the multi-domain Epac proteins. In addition, these proteins have been implicated in various cellular processes such as integrin-mediated cell adhesion and cell-cell junction formation, the control of insulin secretion and neurotransmitter release. In most of these processes, cAMP signaling through protein kinase A (PKA) is also involved, stressing the interconnectivity between Epac- and PKA-mediated signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036a4","doi":"10.1016\/j.tibs.2006.10.002","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T23:58:43+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Trends in Biochemical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1211712208,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tibs.2006.10.002","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17084085"],"pmid":"17084085","pubdate":"2006-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Epac proteins: multi-purpose cAMP targets.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epac-proteins-multipurpose-camp-targets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4039757,"mean":5.0584459755298,"rank":931360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2550923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4039757,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128991,"mean":9.1405925730678,"rank":39510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":87675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128991,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":979,"mean":3.2938609406953,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":979,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":7.2632727272727,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":13,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Researcher":34,"Student  > Ph.
