Herein, we examined nNOS involvement in glufosinate-induced convulsions and the specificity of 7-NI for nNOS. Another nNOS inhibitor, 1-[2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]imidazole (TRIM), inhibited NOS activity in vivo, and it prevented glufosinate-induced convulsions. In contrast, an endothelial NOS inhibitor, N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine, inhibited NOS activity in vivo, but it did not prevent the convulsions. These results suggest the involvement of nNOS in glufosinate-induced convulsions. However, a nonspecific NOS inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, inhibited NOS activity in vivo, but it failed to prevent glufosinate-induced convulsions. 6-NI and indazole, which did not inhibit NOS activity in vivo, suppressed glufosinate-induced convulsions. Moreover, glufosinate elicited convulsions in nNOS-deficient mice. These results suggest the anticonvulsant effects of 7-NI and TRIM on glufosinate-induced convulsions do not involve nNOS inhibition, instead possibly being related to an undefined property of nitrogen-containing chemical structures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de2","authors":["Nobuko Matsumura","Kazue Kikuchi-Utsumi","Toshio Nakaki"],"doi":"10.1124\/jpet.107.135160","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T01:03:26+00:00","issns":["1521-0103 (Online)"],"journal":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1349921071,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1124\/jpet.107.135160","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18270316"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jpet.aspetjournals.org\/content\/325\/2\/357.full.pdf","pmid":"18270316","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Activities of 7-nitroindazole and 1-(2-(trifluoromethylphenyl)-imidazole independent of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase inhibition.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activities-7nitroindazole-12trifluoromethylphenylimidazole-independent-neuronal-nitricoxide-synthase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":816825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95261,"mean":8.2153807894186,"rank":24767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95261,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1522,"mean":2.837641025641,"rank":200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1522,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.7016129032258,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
