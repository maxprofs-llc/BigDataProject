The jamming probability J(d) is measured where d identical withR\/D. We found that J(d) decreases from 1 to zero when d increases from 2 to 5. From observing the disk configurations of the arch in the jamming events, the jamming probability can be explained quantitatively by treating the arch as the trajectory of a restricted random walker.","ads_id":"2001PhRvL..86...71T","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Kiwing To","Pik-Yin Lai","H.
