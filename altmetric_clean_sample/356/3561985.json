Genotype-phenotype correlations in male patients with a partial nullisomy of the X chromosome have suggested that at least one locus involved in MRX is on Xp22.3. Previous deletion mapping has shown that this gene resides between markers DXS1060 and DXS1139, a region encompassing approximately 1.5 Mb of DNA. Analyzing the DNA of 15 males with Xp deletions, we were able to narrow this MRX critical interval to approximately 15 kb of DNA. Only one gene, VCX-A (variably charged, X chromosome mRNA on CRI-S232A), was shown to reside in this interval. Because of a variable number of tandem 30-bp repeats in the VCX-A gene, the size of the predicted protein is 186-226 amino acids. VCX-A belongs to a gene family containing at least four nearly identical paralogues on Xp22.3 (VCX-A, -B, -B1, and -C) and two on Yq11.2 (VCY-D, VCY-E), suggesting that the X and Y copies were created by duplication events. We have found that VCX-A is retained in all patients with normal intelligence and is deleted in all patients with mental retardation. There is no correlation between the presence or absence of VCX-B1, -B, and VCX-C and mental status in our patients. These results suggest that VCX-A is sufficient to maintain normal mental development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["Fukami, M","Kirsch, S","Schiller, S","Richter, A","Benes, V","Franco, B","Muroya, K","Rao, E","Merker, S","Niesler, B","Ballabio, A","Ansorge, W","Ogata, T","Rappold, G A"],"doi":"10.1086\/303047","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T23:55:55+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0002-9297"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1207778861,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1086\/303047","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10903929","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1287516"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0002929707632431\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC1287516","pmid":"10903929","pubdate":"2000-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"A Member of a Gene Family on Xp22.3, VCX-A, Is Deleted in Patients with X-Linked Nonspecific Mental Retardation","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/member-gene-family-xp223-vcxa-deleted-patients-xlinked-nonspecific-mental-retardation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":815968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95880,"mean":8.2272005757259,"rank":25022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95880,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2910,"mean":6.3576473014782,"rank":913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2910,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.15,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
