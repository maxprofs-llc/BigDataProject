The threshold subcutaneous doses of NPA and apomorphine to significantly inhibit motor activity or DA synthesis are 1.25 and 24 microgram\/kg, respectively. The intravenous ED 50 of NPA to inhibit dopaminergic firing is 0.36 microgram\/kg and that for apomorphine is 9.1 microgram\/kg. The above effects of NPA, as those of apomorphine, are antagonized by haloperidol and, stereospecifically by (--) sulpiride.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002427","authors":["A Argiolas","G Mereu","G Serra","M R Melis","F Fadda","G L Gessa"],"doi":"10.1016\/0006-8993(82)90011-7","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T01:07:14+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0006-8993"],"issue":"1","journal":"Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1269792884,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6799148"],"pmid":"6799148","pubdate":"1982-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"N-n-propyl-norapomorphine: an extremely potent stimulant of dopamine autoreceptors.","type":"article","volume":"231","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nnpropylnorapomorphine-extremely-potent-stimulant-dopamine-autoreceptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9196455088828,"rank":815898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96243,"mean":8.2912077055757,"rank":25208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96243,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2097,"mean":2.8688711832061,"rank":297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2097,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.8,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Propylnorapomorphine","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=352554620#altmetric_citation_7","license":"public","citation_ids":[3565835,3565835,3565835],"posted_on":"2010-03-28T16:14:44+00:00","summary":"N-n-Propylnorapomorphine (NPA) is an aporphine derivative dopamine agonist closely related to apomorphine.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=17508853","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Vanished 45kd09la13","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Vanished 45kd09la13"}}]}}
