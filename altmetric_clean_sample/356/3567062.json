This Letter reports experiments performed in mice showing that these dynamics can, however, be changed. By stimulating the immune response, we induced strong neutrophilia around the tumor. The neutrophils hindered cell surface diffusion so much that they induced new dynamics compatible with the slower quenched-disorder Edwards-Wilkinson universality class. Important clinical effects were also seen, including remarkably high tumor necrosis (around 80%-90% of the tumor), a general increase in survival time [the death ratio in the control group is 15.76 times higher than in the treated group (equivalent to a Cox's model hazard ratio of 0.85; 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.95, p=0.004)], and even the total elimination of some tumors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Br\u00fa A","Albertos S","L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda-Asenjo JA","Br\u00fa I"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T01:32:12+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"23","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1222341999,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15245196"],"pmid":"15245196","pubdate":"2004-07-12T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Pinning of tumoral growth by enhancement of the immune response.","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pinning-tumoral-growth-enhancement-immune-response"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9287830669226,"rank":815433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93309,"mean":7.2466748403138,"rank":23680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93309,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11953,"mean":6.8515409973226,"rank":3971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":5909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11953,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":18.657781818182,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
