It is present in mammals, higher plants and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This study was undertaken to localize and further characterize the TCTP in human cell lysates using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, monoclonal antibodies, and 45Ca-gel overlay. TCTP was found in several healthy and tumoral cells including erythrocytes, hepatocytes, macrophages, platelets, keratinocytes, erythroleukemia cells, gliomas, melanomas, hepatoblastomas, and lymphomas. It could not be detected in kidney and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A monoclonal antibody raised against TCTP detected three isoforms likely due to post-translational modifications. A calcium binding property was found as well as heat stability and cytoplasmic localization. The high degree of homology from plants to man and its expression in many tissues suggests that TCTP most likely has a cell housekeeping function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f61000722d","authors":["Sanchez, Jean\u2010Charles","Schaller, Dominique","Ravier, Florence","Golaz, Olivier","Jaccoud, Sylviane","Belet, Monique","Wilkins, Marc R.","James, Richard","Deshusses, Jacques","Hochstrasser, Denis","Sanchez, J C","Schaller, D","Ravier, F","Golaz, O","Jaccoud, S","Belet, M","Wilkins, M R","James, R","Deshusses, J","Hochstrasser, D"],"doi":"10.1002\/elps.1150180127","endpage":"155","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T00:07:08+00:00","issns":["1522-2683","0173-0835"],"issue":"1","journal":"Electrophoresis","last_mentioned_on":1197944742,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/elps.1150180127","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9059837"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/elps.1150180127\/pdf","pmid":"9059837","pubdate":"2005-04-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"150","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Translationally controlled tumor protein: a protein identified in several nontumoral cells including erythrocytes.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/translationally-condrolled-tumor-protein-protein-identified-several-nontumoral-cells-including-eryth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636264,"mean":4.9211313967159,"rank":816786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636264,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96475,"mean":8.309211020586,"rank":25318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96475,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":916,"mean":0.90965464480874,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":916,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.80555555555556,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
