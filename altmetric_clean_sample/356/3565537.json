Although the rates at which perioperative core temperatures vary typically range from 0.5 to 2 degrees C\/h, the thermoregulatory contribution of different core cooling rates also remains unknown. In addition, sweating in women is triggered at a slightly greater core temperature than in men. However, it is unknown whether the vasoconstriction and shivering thresholds are comparably greater in women, or if women tolerate a larger range of core temperatures without triggering thermoregulatory responses. Accordingly, the authors sought to (1) define the interthreshold range; (2) test the hypothesis that, at a constant skin temperature, the vasoconstriction and shivering thresholds are greater during rapid core cooling than during slowly induced hypothermia; and (3) compare the sweating, vasoconstriction, and shivering thresholds in men and women.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002255","authors":["M Lopez","D I Sessler","K Walter","T Emerick","M Ozaki"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T00:59:55+00:00","issns":["0003-3022"],"issue":"4","journal":"Anesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1279031524,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8024131"],"pmid":"8024131","pubdate":"1994-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Rate and gender dependence of the sweating, vasoconstriction, and shivering thresholds in humans.","type":"article","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rate-gender-dependence-sweating-vasoconstriction-shivering-thresholds-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":817162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95163,"mean":8.2064506000296,"rank":24735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95163,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2172,"mean":2.9212160294795,"rank":367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":1405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2172,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":11.534666666667,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
