Southern blot analysis of a human-mouse somatic cell hybrid panel and in situ hybridization using a fluorescent genomic R kappa B probe have allowed assignment of the R kappa B gene (NFRKB) to 11q24-q25. The NFRKB locus is in close proximity to the chromosomal breakpoint implicated in Ewing sarcoma, but it does not appear to span this region. Nonetheless, NFRKB may be particularly useful as the most telomeric marker thus far assigned to 11q.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002945","authors":["B S Adams","K Leung","P S Meltzer","K A Lewis","C Wagner-McPherson","G A Evans","G J Nabel"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T23:31:22+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0888-7543"],"issue":"2","journal":"Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1207776616,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1427843"],"pmid":"1427843","pubdate":"1992-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Localization of the gene encoding R kappa B (NFRKB), a tissue-specific DNA binding protein, to chromosome 11q24-q25.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/localization-gene-encoding-r-kappa-b-nfrkb-tissuespecific-dna-binding-protein-chromosome-11q24q25"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":817738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94858,"mean":8.1153916526984,"rank":24580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94858,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3833,"mean":2.7106696242171,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3833,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.8321176470588,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"NFRKB","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=204545726#altmetric_citation_8","license":"public","citation_ids":[3560756,3560758],"posted_on":"2008-04-09T21:30:16+00:00","summary":"Nuclear factor related to kappa-B-binding protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NFRKB gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=16851138","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
