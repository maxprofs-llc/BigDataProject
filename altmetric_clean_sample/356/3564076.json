Yet most clinical trials of quasi-physiologic doses of intramuscular testosterone in older men show no effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, while cross-sectional epidemiologic studies almost uniformly find that endogenous testosterone levels are positively associated with HDL-cholesterol levels. Further work is required to determine whether and why physiologic testosterone levels in the high normal range appear to be conducive to optimal cardiovascular health for adult men.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccdf","authors":["E L Barrett-Connor","Barrett-Connor, E L"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T00:32:52+00:00","issns":["0338-1684"],"issue":"3","journal":"Diab\u00e8te m\u00e9tabolisme","last_mentioned_on":1493666315,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7556805","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7556805"],"pmid":"7556805","pubdate":"1995-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Testosterone and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in men.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/testosterone-risk-factors-cardiovascular-disease-men"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8157083,"mean":6.8932935902745,"rank":2061455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4966254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8157083,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243379,"mean":8.3773577398121,"rank":70313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":167406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243379,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.6566666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Steroid use in American football","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=210395171#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3564076],"posted_on":"2008-05-05T19:32:34+00:00","summary":"The use of performance enhancing drugs in the sport of American football has been an ongoing issue since the late 1950s, especially in the National Football League (NFL).","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=17235431","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Avenged Eightfold","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Avenged Eightfold"}},{"title":"Anabolic steroid","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=122334559#altmetric_citation_44","license":"public","citation_ids":[3564076],"posted_on":"2007-04-12T21:58:11+00:00","summary":"Anabolic steroids, technically known as anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), are drugs that are structurally related to the cyclic steroid ring system and have similar effects to testosterone in the body.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=19218324","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Wikidudeman","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Wikidudeman"}},{"title":"Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=625835131#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3564076],"posted_on":"2014-09-16T17:01:37+00:00","summary":"The Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 is a bill that would expand the list of anabolic steroids regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to include about two dozen new substances and would establish new crimes relating to false la","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=43808354","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"HistoricMN44","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:HistoricMN44"}},{"title":"Anabolic steroid","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=778210502#altmetric_citation_9ee2a1cc-efb7-4098-a30b-2a7137937b23","license":"public","citation_ids":[3564076],"posted_on":"2017-05-01T19:18:35+00:00","summary":"Anabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic substances that are structurally related and have similar effects to testostero","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=19218324","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Steroidcart","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Steroidcart"}}]}}
