NOS activity is dependent on the presence of both exogenous CaCl2 and NADPH. The inhibitory potency of 7-NI remained unaltered in the presence of different concentrations of either CaCl2 (0.75-7.5 mM) or NADPH (0.05-5.0 mM). 2. Kinetic (Lineweaver-Burke) analysis of the effect of 7-NI on rat cerebellar NOS revealed that inhibition was of a competitive nature with a Ki value of 5.6 microM. The Km of of cerebellar NOS with respect to L-arginine was 2.5 microM. 3. The following indazole derivatives (IC50 values shown in parentheses, all n = 6) caused concentration-related inhibition of rat cerebellar NOS in vitro: 6-nitro indazole (31.6 +\/- 3.4 microM), 5-nitro indazole (47.3 +\/- 2.3 microM), 3-chloro indazole (100.0 +\/- 5.5 microM), 3-chloro 5-nitro indazole (158.4 +\/- 2.1 microM) and indazole (177.8 +\/- 2.1 microM). The IC50 values for 5-amino indazole, 6-amino indazole and 6-sulphanilimido indazole were in excess of 1 mM; 3-indazolinone was inactive. 4. 7-NI (10 mg kg-1) administered i.p. to rats produced 60 min thereafter a significant inhibition of NOS activity in cerebellum (31.1 +\/- 3.2%, n = 6), cerebral cortex (38.2 +\/- 5.6%, n = 6), hippocampus (37.0 +\/- 2.8%, n = 6) and adrenal gland (23.7 +\/- 3.0%, n = 6). NOS activity in olfactory bulb and stomach fundus were unchanged. 5. These results indicate that 7-NI is a potent and competitive inhibitor of rat brain NOS in vitro and also inhibits NOS in different brain regions and in the adrenal gland in vivo. Inhibition of NOS is a characteristic property of the indazole nucleus. Nitration of the indazole ring at positions 5, 6 and 7 results in a graded increase in inhibitory potency. Indazole-based inhibitors of NOS may prove useful tools with which to evaluate the biological roles of nitric oxide in the central nervous system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["R C Babbedge","P A Bland-Ward","S L Hart","P K Moore"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T00:21:55+00:00","issns":["0007-1188"],"issue":"1","journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1210176530,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7693279","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2175991"],"pmcid":"PMC2175991","pmid":"7693279","pubdate":"1993-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Inhibition of rat cerebellar nitric oxide synthase by 7-nitro indazole and related substituted indazoles.","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-rat-cerebellar-nitric-oxide-synthase-7nitro-indazole-related-substituted-indazoles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":816325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95414,"mean":8.2314660476038,"rank":24822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95414,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1702,"mean":3.4119329805996,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1702,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.2983870967742,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
