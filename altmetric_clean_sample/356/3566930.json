Cytochemical studies confirmed the mast cell characteristics of the pathological cell population, while the immunophenotype strongly suggested a bone marrow origin of this malignancy. The course of the disease was not affected by antiproliferative treatment and the patient, after progressive general deterioration, died of intractable haemorrhage. On both clinical and haematological criteria it seems possible to distinguish this rare case of primary mast leukaemia from the more common form of tissue mastocytosis with secondary leukaemia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002446","authors":["R Dalton","L Chan","E Batten","S Eridani"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T01:29:46+00:00","issns":["0007-1048"],"issue":"2","journal":"British Journal of Haematology","last_mentioned_on":1309566287,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3096368"],"pmid":"3096368","pubdate":"1986-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Mast cell leukaemia: evidence for bone marrow origin of the pathological clone.","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mast-cell-leukaemia-evidence-bone-marrow-origin-pathological-clone"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":816948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95236,"mean":8.2097153147479,"rank":24759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95236,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1283,"mean":2.1245304212168,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1283,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.4166666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"SE":1,"BR":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Mast cell leukemia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=437316533#altmetric_citation_11","license":"public","citation_ids":[3566926,3566930],"posted_on":"2011-07-02T00:24:47+00:00","summary":"Mast cell leukemia is an extremely aggressive subtype of acute myeloid leukemia that usually occurs de novo but can, rarely, evolve from transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia into the more aggressive acute myeloid leukemia.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=17807299","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"RDBrown","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:RDBrown"}}]}}
