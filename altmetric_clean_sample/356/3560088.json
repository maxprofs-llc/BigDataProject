Here we have identified a novel MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), termed MLTK (for MLK-like mitogen-activated protein triple kinase), whose expression is increased by activation of the ERK\/MAPK pathway. There are two alternatively spliced forms of MLTK, MLTKalpha and MLTKbeta. When overexpressed in cells, both MLTKalpha and MLTKbeta are able to activate the ERK, JNK\/SAPK, p38, and ERK5 pathways. Moreover, both MLTKalpha and MLTKbeta are activated in response to osmotic shock with hyperosmolar media through autophosphorylation. Remarkably, expression of MLTKalpha, but not MLTKbeta, in Swiss 3T3 cells results in the disruption of actin stress fibers and dramatic morphological changes. A kinase-dead form of MLTKalpha does not cause these phenomena. Inhibition of the p38 pathway significantly blocks MLTKalpha-induced stress fiber disruption and morphological changes. These results suggest that MLTK is a stress-activated MAPKKK that may be involved in the regulation of actin organization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Isamu Gotoh","Makoto Adachi","Eisuke Nishida"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m008595200","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T23:17:18+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1198024020,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M008595200","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11042189"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/276\/6\/4276.full.pdf","pmid":"11042189","pubdate":"2001-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Identification and characterization of a novel MAP kinase kinase kinase, MLTK.","type":"article","volume":"276","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-characterization-novel-map-kinase-kinase-kinase-mltk-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":816262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95490,"mean":8.1972886091594,"rank":24838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95490,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28043,"mean":2.6405892589687,"rank":1753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":10000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28043,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4327851239669,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"ZAK","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=178839649#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3560088],"posted_on":"2007-12-19T00:27:00+00:00","summary":"Sterile alpha motif and leucine zipper containing kinase AZK, also known as ZAK, is a human gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14774555","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
