We find that cells expressing only Gag from one plasmid and only Gag-Pol (in frame) from a separate plasmid can support the propagation of M1 double-stranded RNA, encoding the killer toxin. We use this system to separately investigate the functions of Gag and the Gag part of Gag-Pol. L-A contains two fusion protein molecules per particle, and although N-terminal acetylation of Gag is essential for viral assembly, it is completely dispensable for function of Gag-Pol. In general, the requirements on Gag for viral assembly and propagation are more stringent than on the Gag part of Gag-Pol. Finally, we directly show that it is Gag that instructs the incorporation of Gag-Pol into the viral particles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["J C Ribas","R B Wickner"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T01:14:06+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"15","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1211596353,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9535925"],"pmid":"9535925","pubdate":"1998-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The Gag domain of the Gag-Pol fusion protein directs incorporation into the L-A double-stranded RNA viral particles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","type":"article","volume":"273","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gag-domain-gagpol-fusion-protein-directs-incorporation-la-doublestranded-rna-viral-particles-sacchar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":817042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95205,"mean":8.2073912860806,"rank":24748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95205,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6438064976285,"rank":1754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236,"mean":2.4648255319149,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
