Localization of a human lung adenocarcinoma susceptibility locus, possibly syntenic to the mouse Pas1 locus, in the vicinity of the D12S1034 locus on chromosome 12p11.2-p12.1. Carcinogenesis. 2002;23:1177-83] prompted us to carry out a case-control study in lung ADCA and healthy control subjects to test possible involvement of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in D12S1034 flanking genes RASSF8 and BHLHB3, whose minimal distances from D12S1034 are approximately 16-24 kb. RASSF8 contains a RAS-associated domain and is a candidate tumor suppressor, whereas BHLHB3 is a basic helix-loop-helix domain-containing protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor. We observed no significant association between common SNPs in RASSF8 (rs1546550 in the 3'-UTR and 3 intronic SNPs) and BHLHB3 (Ala298Val and rs1048155 in the 3'-UTR) with lung ADCA risk. However, patient groups carrying one or two copies of the BHLHB3 Val298 variation (i.e., Ala\/Val or Val\/Val genotypes) had a higher proportion of short-term survivors (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.7) compared with those carrying the Ala\/Ala genotype. A replication study in an independent Norwegian lung cancer population of multiple cancer histotypes failed to replicate the significant association of BHLHB3 Ala298Val with survival; such association, however, was confirmed by analysis of ADCA only from both populations. Our results suggest that BHLHB3 variants may affect lung ADCA prognosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fe3cf058f610003039","doi":"10.1016\/j.lungcan.2006.11.008","first_seen_on":"2015-02-13T00:25:40+00:00","issns":["0169-5002"],"journal":"Lung Cancer (01695002)","last_mentioned_on":1207813441,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.lungcan.2006.11.008","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17194498"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.lungcancerjournal.info\/article\/S0169500206006167\/pdf","pmid":"17194498","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Common polymorphisms in D12S1034 flanking genes RASSF8 and BHLHB3 are not associated with lung adenocarcinoma risk.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/common-polymorphisms-d12s1034-flanking-genes-rassf8-bhlhb3-not-associated-lung-adenocarcinoma-risk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":817598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94974,"mean":8.1606790982701,"rank":24650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94974,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":379,"mean":2.3194814814815,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":379,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.15,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
