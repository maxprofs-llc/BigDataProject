Hypertension, a major cause and comorbidity of stroke, entails systemic vascular inflammation and may influence poststroke immune responses. This aspect is, however, underestimated in previous studies. Here we aimed to delineate the sequence of cellular inflammation after stroke in spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. Spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion and killed after 1 or 4 days. Immune cells of the peripheral blood and those which have infiltrated the injured brain were identified and quantified by flow cytometry. The spatial distribution of myeloid cells and T lymphocytes, and the infarct volume were assessed by histology. We observed a concerted infiltration of immune cells into the ischemic brain of SH rats. At day 1, primarily neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid dendritic cells entered the brain, whereas the situation at day 4 was dominated by microglia, macrophages, lymphatic dendritic cells, and T cells. Postischemic inflammation did not cause secondary tissue damage during the subacute stage of experimental stroke in SH rats. Considering the intrinsic vascular pathology of SH rats, our study validates this strain for further translational research in poststroke inflammation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce7","authors":["M\u00f6ller K","Boltze J","P\u00f6sel C","Seeger J","Stahl T","Wagner DC"],"doi":"10.1038\/jcbfm.2013.199","first_seen_on":"2014-04-03T19:41:48+00:00","issns":["0271-678X"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1396017785,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24220169?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24220169","pubdate":"2013-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["metabolism","brain"],"title":"Sterile inflammation after permanent distal MCA occlusion in hypertensive rats.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sterile-inflammation-after-permanent-distal-mca-occlusion-hypertensive-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":2015662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92570,"mean":7.0323503980816,"rank":47916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92570,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":704,"mean":3.8623271692745,"rank":369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":704,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":2.5667058823529,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
