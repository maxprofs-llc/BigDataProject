The aim of this study was to determine the onset of the rise in tension (i.e., slack length) during passive stretching in both Achilles tendon and gastrocnemius medialis. Muscle and tendon shear elastic modulus was measured by elastography (supersonic shear imaging) during passive plantarflexion (0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 of knee angle, 0\u00b0 representing knee fully extended, in a random order) in 9 participants. The within-session repeatability of the determined slack length was good at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion (SEM=3.3\u00b0 and 2.2\u00b0 for Achilles tendon and gastrocnemius medialis, respectively) and very good at 0\u00b0 of knee flexion (SEM=1.9\u00b0 and 1.9\u00b0 for Achilles tendon and gastrocnemius medialis, respectively). The slack length of gastrocnemius medialis was obtained at a significantly lower plantarflexed angle than for Achilles tendon at both 0\u00b0 (P<0.0001; mean difference=19.4\u00b13.8\u00b0) and 90\u00b0 of knee flexion (P<0.0001; mean difference=25.5\u00b17.6\u00b0). In conclusion, this study showed that the joint angle at which the tendon falls slack can be experimentally determined using supersonic shear imaging. The slack length of gastrocnemius medialis and Achilles tendon occurred at different joint angles. Although reporting this result is crucial to a better understanding of muscle-tendon interactions, further experimental investigations are required to explain this result.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002ccf","authors":["Hug F","Lacourpaille L","Ma\u00efsetti O","Nordez A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiomech.2013.07.015","endpage":"2538","first_seen_on":"2014-04-03T19:10:18+00:00","issns":["0021-9290","00219290"],"issue":"14","journal":"Journal of Biomechanics","last_mentioned_on":1396547679,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23953502"],"pmid":"23953502","pubdate":"2013-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2534","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Slack length of gastrocnemius medialis and Achilles tendon occurs at different ankle angles.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/slack-length-gastrocnemius-medialis-achilles-tendon-occurs-different-ankle-angles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230817,"mean":5.9681223701699,"rank":4607959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230817,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133291,"mean":8.2033925575813,"rank":89139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":24637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133291,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1187,"mean":3.389934232715,"rank":826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1187,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":4.1916666666667,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
