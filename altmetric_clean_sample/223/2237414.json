Four parameters were measured in the body and pharyngeal region at weekly intervals. At day 49 post-exposure at 20\u00b0C, the body of the second mother rediae (R1b) was significantly longer than that of the subsequent generations, R2a and R2b\/R3a (a mean of 3.0 mm instead of 1.0 and 0.9 mm, respectively). The body was significantly wider in the R1b and R2a groups than in the R2b\/R3a rediae. The pharyngeal lumen was significantly wider in the R1b group than in the R2a and R2b\/R3a rediae (a mean of 48.6 \u03bcm instead of 10.8 and 3.3 \u03bcm at day 49). The thickness of the pharyngeal wall did not differ in the R1b and R2b\/R3a groups, but was significantly lower in the R2a group (19.5 \u03bcm instead of 23.0-23.6 at day 49). There was better development of R1b and R2b\/R3a rediae in the snails when the R1a redia died, compared with normal larval development (with a living R1a redia).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd9","authors":["Augot D","Abrous M","Rondelaud D","Dreyfuss G","Cabaret J"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0022149x99000037","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T00:19:26+00:00","issns":["0022-149X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Helminthology","last_mentioned_on":1395485883,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23745981?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23745981","pubdate":"2013-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Fasciola hepatica: an unusual development of redial generations in an isolate of Lymnaea truncatula.","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fasciola-hepatica-unusual-development-redial-generations-isolate-lymnaea-truncatula"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2300030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1608626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107083,"mean":7.9416373246673,"rank":53262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":37613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107083,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":1.3617520661157,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/worm_papers\/status\/447326335036170241","license":"public","citation_ids":[2237414],"posted_on":"2014-03-22T10:58:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Helminth papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/442964093498949632\/nwlIaKzr_normal.jpeg","description":"Automated paper feed twitter bot for academics interested in parasitic worms, gut parasites and anthelminthics","id_on_source":"worm_papers","tweeter_id":"2381877092","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":324},"tweet_id":"447326335036170241"}]}}
