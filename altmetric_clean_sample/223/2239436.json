To better understand the biology and diapause mechanism of the insect pest species, D. antiqua, the transcriptome was sequenced using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. Approximately 54 million reads were obtained, trimmed, and assembled into 29,659 unigenes, with an average length of 607 bp and an N50 of 818 bp. Among these unigenes, 21,605 (72.8%) were annotated in the public databases. All unigenes were then compared against Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. Codon usage bias was analyzed and 332 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected in this organism. These data represent the most comprehensive transcriptomic resource currently available for D. antiqua and will facilitate the study of genetics, genomics, diapause, and further pest control of D. antiqua.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074ea","authors":["Zhang Y","Hao Y","Si F","Ren S","Hu G","Shen L","Chen B"],"doi":"10.1534\/g3.113.009779","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T04:27:29+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":[""],"issue":"","journal":"G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1394747481,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24615268?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24615268","pubdate":"2014-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"The De Novo Transcriptome and Its Analysis of the Worldwide Vegetable Pest, Delia antiqua (Diptera: Anthomyiidae).","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ide-novoi-transcriptome-analysis-worldwide-vegetable-pest-idelia-antiquai-diptera-anthomyiidae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627775,"mean":4.946368885166,"rank":2905628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627775,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92600,"mean":7.0584480177973,"rank":73841,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92600,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":436,"mean":3.9140459770115,"rank":307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":436,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.0921052631579,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fly_papers\/status\/444229251718316032","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2239436],"posted_on":"2014-03-13T21:51:21+00:00","author":{"name":"flypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3298285242\/dc1d0402d707fe3606f9d653cd85fe6d_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Drosophila papers in #PubMed\/#arXiv\/#bioRxiv\/#PeerJ\/#F1000.
