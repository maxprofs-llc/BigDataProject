The study included 144 HBsAg-positive mothers and their neonates. The frequencies of DCs and TLR3 were determined using four-colour flow-cytometric analysis. DC and TLR3 frequencies were not related to HBV intrauterine transmission, maternal HBeAg positivity, maternal HBV DNA positivity and HBeAg\/HBV DNA double-positivity. The plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) frequencies in neonates whose maternal HBV DNA was >5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 copies\/ml decreased significantly compared to that in neonates whose maternal HBV DNA was \u2a7d5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 copies\/ml (Z\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a02\u00b7170, P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b703) or whose maternal HBV DNA was negative (Z\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a01\u00b7981 P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7048). This study suggests that neonatal pDC frequencies decrease when maternal HBV DNA loads are >5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 copies\/ml.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006544","authors":["Guo J","Gao Y","Guo Z","Zhang LR","Wang B","Wang SP"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0950268814000624","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T00:01:28+00:00","issns":["0950-2688"],"issue":"","journal":"Epidemiology & Infection","last_mentioned_on":1395563284,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24650439?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24650439","pubdate":"2014-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Frequencies of dendritic cells and Toll-like receptor 3 in neonates born to HBsAg-positive mothers with different HBV serological profiles.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frequencies-dendritic-cells-tolllike-receptor-3-neonates-born-hbsagpositive-mothers-different-hbv-se"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634284,"mean":4.9206846148246,"rank":2015305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634284,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93066,"mean":7.0225152097998,"rank":48120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93066,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":751,"mean":3.0513466666667,"rank":390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":751,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.8723636363636,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
