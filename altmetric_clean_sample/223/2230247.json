Knowledge of clinical findings of dermatoses suggesting coincidence of malignant proliferative processes facilitates diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. We would like to present a case of Sweet's syndrome, qualified for comparative paraneoplastic skin syndromes. Sweet's syndrome, acute, febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, was first described by Robert Douglas Sweet in 1964 as a disorder characterized by fever, skin lesions of erythematous-infiltrative character, leukocytosis with neutrophilia and dense infiltrations of dermis by mature neutrophils. Sweet's syndrome aetiology is not fully understood, although cytokine abnormalities suggest that Th1 lymphocytes play an important role in pathogenesis of the dermatosis. Factors inducing Sweet's syndrome include: haematopoietic hyperplasia; neoplasms: genitourinary, breast, gastrointestinal; infections of the respiratory and alimentary system; inflammatory bowel diseases; drugs; pregnancy and vaccinations. Systemic corticosteroids are the \"gold standard\" of Sweet's syndrome treatment; potassium iodide or colchicine may also be used. Indomethacin, clofazimine, cyclosporine A and sulfones are the second-line drugs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56bde5972a83eeb1128b4569","authors":["Sebastian Kaszewski","Rafa\u0142 Czajkowski","Franciszka Protas-Drozd","Waldemar Placek","Sebastian Jakubowski"],"doi":"10.5114\/pdia.2014.40661","first_seen_on":"2014-04-02T09:58:05+00:00","issns":["1642-395X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Advances in Dermatology and Allergology","last_mentioned_on":1396779063,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24683399","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3952057\/"],"pmid":"24683399","pubdate":"2014-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Termedia Publishing House Ltd.","title":"Sweet's syndrome with idiopathic thrombocythemia.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sweets-syndrome-idiopathic-thrombocythemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8445734,"mean":7.1009458620031,"rank":3522569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4877281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8445734,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178612,"mean":7.6128559271268,"rank":58983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":118231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178612,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":1.9122093023256,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.2285714285714,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"IE":1,"PS":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SweetsSyndrome\/status\/452750322424107008","license":"public","rt":["sweetsfiend"],"citation_ids":[2230247],"posted_on":"2014-04-06T10:11:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Sweet's Syndrome","url":"http:\/\/sweetssyndromeawareness.com\/","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/443369231719993344\/Qru_k5OM_normal.jpeg","description":"Our goal is to promote awareness of this rare disease and symptoms to the medical community and public to reach more timely and adequate diagnoses.","id_on_source":"SweetsSyndrome","tweeter_id":"2334132594","geo":{"_id":"Cardiff, UK \/ Huntsville, TX"},"followers":63},"tweet_id":"452750322424107008"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SweetsSyndrome\/status\/451264645681405952","license":"public","rt":["sweetsfiend"],"citation_ids":[2230247],"posted_on":"2014-04-02T07:47:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Sweet's Syndrome","url":"http:\/\/sweetssyndromeawareness.com\/","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/443369231719993344\/Qru_k5OM_normal.jpeg","description":"Our goal is to promote awareness of this rare disease and symptoms to the medical community and public to reach more timely and adequate diagnoses.","id_on_source":"SweetsSyndrome","tweeter_id":"2334132594","geo":{"_id":"Cardiff, UK \/ Huntsville, TX"},"followers":63},"tweet_id":"451264645681405952"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sweetsfiend\/status\/451261523575701504","license":"public","citation_ids":[2230247],"posted_on":"2014-04-02T07:35:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Michelle Holder","url":"https:\/\/helpforsweetssyndromeuk.wordpress.com\/about\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/601001481349783553\/qmKSCR44_normal.png","description":"Helping those with the rare autoinflammatory condition & neutrophilic dermatosis, Sweet's syndrome | Administrator & Researcher for Sweet's Syndrome UK","id_on_source":"sweetsfiend","tweeter_id":"955817893","geo":{"lt":51.48,"ln":-3.18,"country":"GB"},"followers":345},"tweet_id":"451261523575701504"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GRDO_IRELAND\/status\/451731801594408960","license":"public","rt":["sweetsfiend"],"citation_ids":[2230247],"posted_on":"2014-04-03T14:43:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Rare Diseases IE","url":"http:\/\/www.grdo.ie","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/484329449790246912\/I9YN1qCP_normal.jpeg","description":"Rare Diseases Ireland -
