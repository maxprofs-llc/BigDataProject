Instead of hospitalization or institutionalization, the elderly and disabled can be assisted in their own environment 24h a day with numerous 'smart' devices. The concept of the smart home is a promising and cost-effective way of improving home care for the elderly and the disabled in a non-obtrusive way, allowing greater independence, maintaining good health and preventing social isolation. Smart homes are equipped with sensors, actuators, and\/or biomedical monitors. The devices operate in a network connected to a remote centre for data collection and processing. The remote centre diagnoses the ongoing situation and initiates assistance procedures as required. The technology can be extended to wearable and in vivo implantable devices to monitor people 24h a day both inside and outside the house. This review describes a selection of projects in developed countries on smart homes examining the various technologies available. Advantages and disadvantages, as well as the impact on modern society, are discussed. Finally, future perspectives on smart homes as part of a home-based health care network are presented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5013cf058f610003078","authors":["Chan M","Campo E","Est\u00e8ve D","Fourniols JY","Marie Chan","Eric Campo","Daniel Est\u00e8ve","Jean-Yves Fourniols"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.maturitas.2009.07.014","first_seen_on":"2014-04-03T10:28:42+00:00","issns":["0378-5122"],"issue":"2","journal":"Maturitas","last_mentioned_on":1443086472,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.maturitas.2009.07.014#.Uzz7RfpcEz4.twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.maturitas.2009.07.014"],"pmid":"19729255","pubdate":"2009-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Smart homes - current features and future perspectives.","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/smart-homes-current-features-future-perspectives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7813034,"mean":6.6314437650464,"rank":1202549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6605162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7813034,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175412,"mean":7.3689362468719,"rank":30145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":145122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175412,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1333,"mean":5.0731546546547,"rank":236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":1097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1333,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":5.5888571428571,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Librarian":6,"Researcher":46,"Student  > Doctoral Student":24,"Student  > Ph.
