Since 2006, when unexpectedly high colony losses were first reported, articles have proliferated in the popular press suggesting a range of possible causes and raising alarm over the general decline of bees. Suggested causes include pesticides, genetically modified crops, habitat fragmentation, and introduced diseases and parasites. Scientists have concluded that multiple factors in various combinations-including mites, fungi, viruses, and pesticides, as well as other factors such as reduction in forage, poor nutrition, and queen failure-are the most probable cause of elevated colony loss rates. Investigators and regulators continue to focus on the possible role that insecticides, particularly the neonicotinoids, may play in honeybee health. Neonicotinoid insecticides are insect neurotoxicants with desirable features such as broad-spectrum activity, low application rates, low mammalian toxicity, upward systemic movement in plants, and versatile application methods. Their distribution throughout the plant, including pollen, nectar, and guttation fluids, poses particular concern for exposure to pollinators. The authors describe how neonicotinoids interact with the nervous system of honeybees and affect individual honeybees in laboratory situations. Because honeybees are social insects, colony effects in semifield and field studies are discussed. The authors conclude with a review of current and proposed guidance in the United States and Europe for assessing the risks of pesticides to honeybees.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f0","authors":["Fairbrother A","Purdy J","Anderson T","Fell R","Fairbrother, Anne","Purdy, John","Anderson, Troy","Fell, Richard","Anne Fairbrother","John Purdy","Troy Anderson","Richard Fell"],"doi":"10.1002\/etc.2527","endpage":"731","first_seen_on":"2014-04-02T12:22:58+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1552-8618","0730-7268","07307268"],"issue":"4","journal":"Environmental Toxicology & Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1498071415,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/etc.2527\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/etc.2527\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/etc.2527\/pdf","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/etc.2527\/full#etc2527-sec-0021","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/etc.2527\/full#etc2527","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24692231","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/etc.2527\/epdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4312970","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4312970\/","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/etc.2527\/full?hootPostID=05b47ada5942b8373e7d44dd46e4ffb6","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24692231"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/etc.2527\/pdf","pmid":"24692231","pubdate":"2014-04-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SETAC Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"719","subjects":["chemistry","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Risks of neonicotinoid insecticides to honeybees","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risks-neonicotinoid-insecticides-honeybees"},"altmetric_score":{"score":99.4,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":99.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8407754,"mean":7.0775818090677,"rank":87413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8320359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8407754,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178482,"mean":7.6018863072262,"rank":2190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":176292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178482,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2769,"mean":4.0864125722543,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":2760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2769,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":10.213444444444,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":36,"researcher":9,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":35,"Scientists":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":37,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
