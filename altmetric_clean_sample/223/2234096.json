Notwithstanding, there has been limited evaluation of the degree to which changeable daily meteorological patterns influence affective disorder admission rates. A handful of small studies have alluded to a potential link between psychiatric admission rates and meteorological variables such as environmental temperature (heat waves in particular), wind direction and sunshine. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test, ARIMA and time-series regression analyses to examine whether daily meteorological variables-namely wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, rainfall, hours of sunshine, sunlight radiation and temperature-influence admission rates for mania and depression across 12 regions in Ireland over a 31-year period. Although we found some very weak but interesting trends for barometric pressure in relation to mania admissions, daily meteorological patterns did not appear to affect hospital admissions overall for mania or depression. Our results do not support the small number of papers to date that suggest a link between daily meteorological variables and affective disorder admissions. Further study is needed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b28","authors":["McWilliams S","Kinsella A","O'Callaghan E"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00484-014-0805-9","first_seen_on":"2014-04-03T13:56:37+00:00","issns":["0020-7128"],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Biometeorology","last_mentioned_on":1416921780,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24599495\/?i=2&from=seasonal%20depression","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24599495"],"pmid":"24599495","pubdate":"2014-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biophysics and Biological Physics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Meteorology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Atmospheric Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Earth and Planetary Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Daily weather variables and affective disorder admissions to psychiatric hospitals.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/daily-weather-variables-affective-disorder-admissions-psychiatric-hospitals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4550001,"mean":5.3126583765574,"rank":1803262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2724468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4550001,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107079,"mean":8.1007875940903,"rank":36930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":69468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107079,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282,"mean":4.4135729537367,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":4.6678461538462,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
