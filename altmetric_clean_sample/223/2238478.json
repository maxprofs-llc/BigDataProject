Twenty-nine eyes of 15 infants are included. All infants were referred from level I or II nurseries, received supplemental unmonitored oxygen for prolonged duration (>1 week) and had multiple systemic co-morbidities. Of the 29 eyes, 10 (34.5%) had zone 1 and 19 (65.5%) had posterior zone 2 disease. Twenty-five (86.2%) eyes had flat neovascularization and 4 (13.8%) eyes had brush like proliferation. We noticed large vascular loops in 10 (34.5%) eyes. After confluent laser photocoagulation, 22 (75.9%) eyes had a favorable outcome. The study concludes that APROP in heavier (\u2265 1500 g birth weight) premature infants occurs mostly in posterior zone 2 with flat neovascularization and atypical features like large vascular loops. Supplemental unmonitored oxygen for prolonged duration and multiple systemic co-morbidities could be a contributing factor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aaf","authors":["Sanghi G","Dogra MR","Katoch D","Gupta A"],"doi":"10.4103\/0301-4738.128639","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T02:45:52+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Indian Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1395156501,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24618495?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24618495","pubdate":"2014-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity in infants \u22651500 g birth weight.","type":"article","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aggressive-posterior-retinopathy-prematurity-infants-1500-g-birth-weight"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3554204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123624,"mean":8.1517954749523,"rank":82900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123624,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":534,"mean":0.80290806754221,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":534,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.43076923076923,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
