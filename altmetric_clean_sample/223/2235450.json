Hydrocarbon pneumonitis following aspiration of diesel is a form of exogenous lipoid pneumonia wherein, aspirated diesel reaches the alveoli rapidly without evoking any significant cough, but initiates an intense inflammatory reaction in the pulmonary parenchyma. This is a rarely described clinical scenario, although the practice of diesel siphonage from automobiles is a common practice in developing countries. We herein describe a 40-year-old male patient, in whom the diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia was delayed for a long duration and highlight the importance of taking a detailed occupational exposure history in patients with non-resolving pneumonia to rule out the underlying possibility of this rare clinical entity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f61000419d","authors":["Venkatnarayan K","Madan K","Walia R","Kumar J","Jain D","Guleria R"],"doi":"10.4103\/0970-2113.125986","first_seen_on":"2014-04-03T18:05:58+00:00","issns":["0970-2113"],"issue":"1","journal":"Lung India","last_mentioned_on":1396093949,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24669087?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC3960815","pmid":"24669087","pubdate":"2014-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"\"Diesel siphoner's lung\": Exogenous lipoid pneumonia following hydrocarbon aspiration.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diesel-siphoners-lung-exogenous-lipoid-pneumonia-following-hydrocarbon-aspiration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3060826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":940410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106750,"mean":7.9421719735082,"rank":72554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":22769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106750,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":1.2376129032258,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.72,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"EG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aghoury79\/status\/449876747291332609","license":"public","citation_ids":[2235450],"posted_on":"2014-03-29T11:52:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Ahmed Elaghoury","url":"http:\/\/eg.linkedin.com\/in\/aghoury","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/749706574990573568\/1hdbWkTG_normal.jpg","description":"Physician specialized & blogging in psychiatry, sleep medicine & related neurology.","id_on_source":"aghoury79","tweeter_id":"55548061","geo":{"lt":31.21564,"ln":29.95527,"country":"EG"},"followers":2027},"tweet_id":"449876747291332609"}]}}
