The mass was located in the gingiva of the upper left premolar to molar region and showed multinodular growth patterns. The mass comprised epithelioid cells arranged in densely packed sheets. Tumor cells had large, round to oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli and an abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, most of the tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and vimentin, but all lacked melanoma-associated antigen and muscle and neuroendocrine markers. Stains for type IV collagen showed linear immunoreactivity around single cells and groups of cells. Ultrastructurally, tumor cells were separated by a well-defined basement membrane, and interdigitating cell processes were observed. To our knowledge, this is first report of feline malignant epithelioid schwannoma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1f","authors":["Boonsriroj H","Kimitsuki K","Akagi T","Park CH"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T02:04:13+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Veterinary Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1395229746,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24632862?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24632862","pubdate":"2014-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Malignant Epithelioid Schwannoma of the Oral Cavity in a Cat.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/malignant-epithelioid-schwannoma-oral-cavity-cat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3554203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123624,"mean":8.1517894081201,"rank":82899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123624,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1227,"mean":1.0966753670473,"rank":716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1227,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.0084905660377,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
