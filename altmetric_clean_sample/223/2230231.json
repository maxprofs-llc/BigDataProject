APC is likely to participate in a wide spectrum of biological functions via its different functional domains and is abundantly expressed in the brain as well as in peripheral tissues. However, the neuronal function of APC is poorly understood. To investigate the functional role of Apc in the central nervous system, we analyzed the neurological phenotypes of Apc1638T\/1638T mice, which carry a targeted deletion of the 3' terminal third of Apc that does not affect Wnt signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000872","doi":"10.1186\/1756-6606-7-21","first_seen_on":"2014-04-02T09:56:18+00:00","issns":["1756-6606"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Brain","last_mentioned_on":1396422133,"links":["http:\/\/www.molecularbrain.com\/content\/7\/1\/21\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molecularbrain.com\/content\/pdf\/1756-6606-7-21.pdf","pmid":"24678719","pubdate":"2014-03-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"21","subjects":["molecularbiology","brain"],"title":"Targeted deletion of the C-terminus of the mouse adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor results in neurologic phenotypes related to schizophrenia","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeted-deletion-cterminus-mouse-adenomatous-polyposis-coli-tumor-suppressor-results-neurologic-phe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228670,"mean":5.9649392979483,"rank":4606233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228670,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133107,"mean":8.1883264465916,"rank":88970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":24653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133107,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":386,"mean":3.7377350649351,"rank":304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":386,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":3.4604347826087,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
