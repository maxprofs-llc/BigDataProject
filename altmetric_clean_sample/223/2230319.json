However, most studies have failed to evaluate the persistence of these effects in long-term survivors. The present study comprehensively assessed the prevalence and predictors of sexual\/body image problems among survivors three or more years post diagnosis. DESIGN\/OUTCOME MEASURES: Eighty-three breast cancer survivors completed surveys a median of seven years post diagnosis. Survey items probed demographic, diagnostic and clinical information, in addition to sexual activity, sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI]), body image, and distress regarding body changes and sexual problems (Female Sexual Distress Scale-revised; FSDS-R).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d83cf058f6100013b4","authors":["Greer A.
