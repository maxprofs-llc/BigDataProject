While medical therapy (MT) consisting of diuresis, hyperosmolar therapy, ventriculostomy, and barbiturate coma is the standard of care, decompressive craniectomy (DC) for refractory intracranial hypertension (ICH) has gained renewed interest. Since TBI treatment guidelines consider DC a second-tier intervention after MT failure, we sought to determine if early DC (<48 hours) was associated with improved survival in patients with refractory ICH.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb22a83ee005f8b4573","doi":"10.1097\/ta.0000000000000194","first_seen_on":"2014-04-02T09:30:59+00:00","issns":["2163-0755"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, The","last_mentioned_on":1405003080,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/Fulltext\/2014\/04000\/Decompressive_craniectomy_or_medical_management.6.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/Abstract\/2014\/04000\/Decompressive_craniectomy_or_medical_management.6.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24662856"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/2014\/04000\/Decompressive_craniectomy_or_medical_management.6.pdf","pmid":"24662856","pubdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"944","title":"Decompressive craniectomy or medical management for refractory intracranial hypertension: An AAST-MIT propensity score analysis.","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decompressive-craniectomy-medical-management-refractory-intracranial-hypertension"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.768,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.768},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228364,"mean":5.9650067502509,"rank":478346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":5750237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228364,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133107,"mean":8.1882421678964,"rank":15046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":118060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133107,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2223,"mean":5.7284131413141,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":1951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2223,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":5.4683461538462,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1,"GB":1,"US":1,"GR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stlegriel\/status\/451225021214896128","license":"public","rt":["JTraumAcuteSurg"],"citation_ids":[2230106],"posted_on":"2014-04-02T05:10:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Legriel St\u00e9phane","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/668557794153467904\/DBSpAxIV_normal.jpg","description":"Intensivist.
