With insufficient survey data available for these species in Portuguese Continental waters, this study shows that fishery-dependent data associated with fishers' knowledge can be used to identify potential Essential Fish Habitats (EFH) for seven skate species. Sites with similar geomorphology were associated with the occurrence of juveniles and\/or adults of the same group of species. For example, sites deeper than 100\u00a0m with soft sediment include predominantly adults of Raja clavata, and are the habitat for egg deposition of this species. Raja undulata and R. microocellata are the more coastal species, preferring sand or gravel habitats, while coastal areas with rocks and sand seabed are potential nursery areas for R. brachyura, R. montagui and R. clavata. The main output of this study is the identification of preferential fishing sites enclosing potential EFH for some species, associated with egg-laying and nursery grounds. The location of these areas will be considered for future seasonal closures, and studies will be conducted to evaluate the biological and socio-economic impacts of such measures. As in the past, fishermen will collaborate in the process of evaluating those impacts, since they have practical and applied knowledge that is extremely valuable for evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of such closures. In conclusion, this study is a first contribution to the understanding and identification of EFH for skate species, associated with nursery and egg deposition sites, with direct application to management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000652d","authors":["B\u00e1rbara Serra-Pereira","Karim Erzini","Catarina Maia","Ivone Figueiredo"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00267-014-0257-3","first_seen_on":"2014-04-02T18:30:46+00:00","issns":["1432-1009","0364-152X"],"journal":"Environmental Management","last_mentioned_on":1428624000,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00267-014-0257-3","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00267-014-0257-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00267-014-0257-3.pdf","pmid":"24573167","pubdate":"2014-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Management","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Forestry Management","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nature Conservation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Identification of Potential Essential Fish Habitats for Skates Based on Fishers\u2019 Knowledge","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00267-014-0257-3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-potential-essential-fish-habitats-skates-based-fishers-knowledge"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7171266,"mean":6.3130605515175,"rank":1197085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5970202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7171266,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171985,"mean":7.2144503325893,"rank":31206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":140636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171985,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":789,"mean":3.6745228426396,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":789,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.4866666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
