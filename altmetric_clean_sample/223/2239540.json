Immunotherapy against ovarian cancer is a promising strategy to develop from animal-based cancer research. We investigated changes in the immunogenicity of paclitaxel-exposed ovarian cancer cells following exposure to other chemotherapeutic drugs. Murine ovarian surface epithelial cells (MOSECs) showed some resistance to paclitaxel, a first-line therapy for ovarian cancer. However, MOSECs pre-exposed to paclitaxel died through apoptosis after incubation with doxorubicin or cisplatin for 2 h. Injected into mice, the paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs post-treated with doxorubicin induced more MOSEC-specific CD4(+) T cells and extended survival for a greater time than MOSECs treated with paclitaxel alone; and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) expressed higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules and produced IL-12 after co-culture with paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs treated with doxorubicin. We also observed that in paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs treated with doxorubicin, but not cisplatin, the expression of MyD88 and related target proteins decreased compared to paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs only, while in BMDCs co-cultured with these MOSECs the expression of myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) increased. These findings suggest that paclitaxel pre-exposed cancer cells treated with doxorubicin can induce significant apoptosis and a therapeutic antitumor immune response in advanced ovarian cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007977","authors":["Kim JE","Jang MJ","Jin DH","Chung YH","Choi BS","Park GB","Kim YS","Kim S","Hur DY","Hung CF","Kim D"],"doi":"10.3892\/ijo.2014.2308","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T04:35:46+00:00","issns":["1019-6439"],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1415978223,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24573741?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24573741","pubdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Spandidos Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Paclitaxel-exposed ovarian cancer cells induce cancer\u2011specific CD4+ T cells after doxorubicin exposure through regulation of MyD88 expression.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paclitaxelexposed-ovarian-cancer-cells-induce-cancerspecific-cd4-t-cells-after-doxorubicin-exposure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2493755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2390026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123624,"mean":8.1517813190105,"rank":56762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":62657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123624,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1097,"mean":2.0763193430657,"rank":439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1097,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.1289302325581,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
