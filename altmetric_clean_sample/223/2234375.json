Adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesions arising in the minor papilla are rare. Literature data thus far are limited to a few individual case reports, and the condition is consequently poorly defined. Our study cases were composed of carcinomas fulfilling all of the following criteria: location at 1.5 to 2.5 cm proximal to the major papilla; presence of associated submucosal pancreatobiliary-type ducts with periductal glands or acinar tissue; a predominant submucosal location of the tumor; and lack of an intestinal-type adenoma in the adjacent duodenal mucosa. Tumors were studied morphologically, immunohistochemically, and clinically. Nine cases fulfilling the inclusion criteria were identified. There were 5 men and 4 women with an age range of 50 to 76 years (median, 72 y). The tumor size ranged from 1.2 to 4.4 cm (median, 3 cm). The carcinomas were of colloid type (3 tumors), pancreatobiliary type (4), or nonmucinous intestinal type (2). Five cases were associated with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)-like precursor lesion within the residual structures of the minor papilla in the duodenal submucosa. Immunohistochemically, the intestinal-type and mucinous-type tumors tended to be positive for CK20, CDX2, MUC2, and B72.3, and pancreatobiliary-type tumors tended to be positive for CK7, MUC1, B72.3, and CA125. Loss of DPC4 (Smad4) expression was found in the pancreatobiliary-type carcinomas only. Two tumors showed loss of DNA mismatch-repair protein expression, one losing MLH1 and PMS2 and the other losing MSH6. Both patients were older than 60 years, and neither had germline mutation testing. Follow-up information was available for 6 patients (median follow-up time, 67.5 mo): 3 of the 6 patients died of disease at 60, 75, and 85 months after surgery, respectively, and all 3 patients had an intestinal-type carcinoma (1 colloid and 2 nonmucinous). The patient whose tumor was MSH6 deficient was alive without evidence of disease 51 months after surgery. In conclusion, adenocarcinomas of the minor papilla are rare tumors occurring predominantly in the sixth to seventh decade. Some of them arise from IPMN-like precursors in the residual submucosal minor papilla tissue. Morphologically, immunohistochemically, and clinically they are similar to ampullary or IPMN-associated pancreatic carcinomas and can exhibit either an intestinal, colloid, or pancreaticobiliary phenotype. DNA mismatch-repair deficiency may occur. A careful gross and histologic examination is essential to accurately recognize the site of origin of minor papilla carcinomas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698e","authors":["Shia J","Agaram NP","Olgac S","Cobanov B","Adsay V","Klimstra DS"],"doi":"10.1097\/pas.0000000000000123","first_seen_on":"2014-04-03T14:32:42+00:00","issns":["0147-5185"],"issue":"4","journal":"The American Journal of Surgical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1400668168,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24625417?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24625417?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24625417","pubdate":"2014-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology","generalsurgery"],"title":"Adenocarcinoma of the minor duodenal papilla and its precursor lesions: a clinical and pathologic study.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adenocarcinoma-minor-duodenal-papilla-precursor-lesions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6344953,"mean":5.8380854127817,"rank":2333507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3918182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6344953,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134133,"mean":8.2278061760059,"rank":49299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":82191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134133,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1374,"mean":4.032725418791,"rank":848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1374,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":3.9024691358025,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
