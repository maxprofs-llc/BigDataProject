Most preclinical pain studies measure elicited behavioral responses to an external noxious stimulus; however, ongoing spontaneous pain in humans and animals may be unrelated to hypersensitivity, and likely diminishes many behaviors, particularly motivated behaviors, that we hypothesize will decrease after induction of acute and chronic pain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000571e","authors":["Ewan EE","Martin TJ"],"doi":"10.1213\/ane.0000000000000119","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T00:25:47+00:00","issns":["0003-2999"],"issue":"4","journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","last_mentioned_on":1395483459,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24651240?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24651240","pubdate":"2014-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Differential suppression of intracranial self-stimulation, food-maintained operant responding, and open field activity by paw incision and spinal nerve ligation in rats.","type":"article","volume":"118","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-suppression-intracranial-selfstimulation-foodmaintained-operant-responding-open-field-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4200235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123624,"mean":8.1517894081201,"rank":101001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123624,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2887,"mean":3.0580866250866,"rank":2391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2887,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":4.2785952380952,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
