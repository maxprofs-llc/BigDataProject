This is an emerging area of research, and there currently is a great deal of interest in the parent's role. This review was written to provide researchers entering this area with a historical introduction to parenting research and to point to some directions for future inquiry. Over the last 75 years, considerable insight has been gained into individual differences in parenting behavior, especially regarding the dimensions underlying individual differences in general parenting approach, and parenting styles resulting from individual differences on these dimensions. The history of empirical attempts to identify parenting dimensions and styles is reviewed briefly, followed by a review of more recent studies of parenting styles. Next is a discussion of data analytic approaches to measuring parenting, with a particular emphasis on variable-centered versus person-centered approaches. Because investigators have often disagreed about which of these approaches is the most appropriate, the advantages and disadvantages of each are considered, along with recommendations for future research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e72","authors":["Power TG"],"doi":"10.1089\/chi.2013.0034","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T03:59:07+00:00","issns":["2153-2168"],"issue":"","journal":"Childhood Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1394776998,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23944920?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23944920","pubdate":"2013-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["metabolism","pediatrics"],"title":"Parenting dimensions and styles: a brief history and recommendations for future research.","type":"article","volume":"9 Suppl","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parenting-dimensions-styles-brief-history-recommendations-future-research"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2312172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1574692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107076,"mean":7.9316188279245,"rank":53502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":36824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107076,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":12.263372093023,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":15.356,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
