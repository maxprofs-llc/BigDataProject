In this mini-review, we summarize the impaired innate and adaptive immune responses involved in immune tolerance in chronic HBV infection. Furthermore, we delineate a novel dual functional small RNA to inhibit HBV replication and stimulate innate immunity against HBV, which proposed a promising immunotherapeutic intervention to interrupt HBV-induced immunotolerance. A mouse model of HBV persistence was established and used to observe the immune tolerant to HBV vaccination, the cell-intrinsic immune tolerance of which might be reversed by chemically synthesized dual functional small RNA (3p-hepatitis B Virus X gene [HBx]-small interfering RNA) in vitro experiments and by biologically constructed dual functional vector (single-stranded RNA-HBx- short hairpin RNA) in vivo experiment using HBV-carrier mice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db7","authors":["Han Q","Lan P","Zhang J","Zhang C","Tian Z"],"doi":"10.1111\/jgh.12034","first_seen_on":"2014-04-03T21:30:47+00:00","issns":["0815-9319"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1395828607,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23855309?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23855309","pubdate":"2013-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Reversal of hepatitis B virus-induced systemic immune tolerance by intrinsic innate immune stimulation.","type":"article","volume":"28 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reversal-hepatitis-b-virusinduced-systemic-immune-tolerance-intrinsic-innate-immune-stimulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4713748,"mean":5.6870663537968,"rank":3947946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4713748,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112168,"mean":8.2169723180616,"rank":91457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112168,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":776,"mean":2.4847509677419,"rank":609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":776,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.3583333333333,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
