Chromosome 22, spanning 51 million base pairs, was the first chromosome to be sequenced. Gene dosage alterations on this chromosome have been shown to be associated with a number of congenital anomalies. In addition, several rare but aggressive tumors have been associated with this chromosome. A number of important gene families including immunoglobulin lambda locus, Crystallin beta family, and APOBEC gene family are located on this chromosome. On the basis of proteomic profiling of 30 histologically normal tissues and cells using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we show protein evidence of 367 genes on chromosome 22. Importantly, this includes 47 proteins, which are currently annotated as \"missing\" proteins. We also confirmed the translation start sites of 120 chromosome 22-encoded proteins. Employing a comprehensive proteogenomics analysis pipeline, we provide evidence of novel coding regions on this chromosome which include upstream ORFs and novel exons in addition to correcting existing gene structures. We describe tissue-wise expression of the proteins and the distribution of gene families on this chromosome. These data have been deposited to ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD000561.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e0f","authors":["Pinto SM","Manda SS","Kim MS","Taylor K","Selvan LD","Balakrishnan L","Subbannayya T","Yan F","Prasad TS","Gowda H","Lee C","Hancock WS","Pandey A"],"doi":"10.1021\/pr401169d","endpage":"2760","first_seen_on":"2014-04-03T19:01:12+00:00","funders":["nci","nigms","nhlbi"],"issns":["1535-3893","1535-3907"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","last_mentioned_on":1422186704,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24669763?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/pr401169d","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24669763?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24669763","pubdate":"2014-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2749","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Functional annotation of proteome encoded by human chromosome 22.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functional-annotation-proteome-encoded-human-chromosome-22"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6560926,"mean":6.0783135390207,"rank":1455048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5079229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6560926,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148077,"mean":7.8898584645724,"rank":40030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":107411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148077,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2559,"mean":3.2529476153245,"rank":413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2559,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":2.6448412698413,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
