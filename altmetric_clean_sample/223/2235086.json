It ligates mainly SLAMF4 on effector\/memory CD8(+) T cells and NK cells, suggesting a potential role during viral infection, with SLAMF2 acting as a ligand to activate SLAMF4-bearing cells. The ability of SLAMF2 to signal on its own after it is engaged and the functional consequences are largely unknown. We found that cytosolic DNA-activated dendritic cells (DCs) upregulate the expression of SLAMF2 molecules. Using anti-SLAMF2 Ab and SLAMF4 recombinant protein, we found that SLAMF2 engagement activates immature DCs and, more interestingly, prolongs the survival of DNA-activated DCs by inhibiting IFN-\u03b2 production and IFN-\u03b2-induced apoptosis and promotes the production of the granzyme B inhibitor protease inhibitor-9. Thus, SLAMF2 can serve as a survival molecule for DNA-activated DCs during their interaction with SLAMF4-expressing cytotoxic T cells. Based on our results, we propose that SLAMF2 engagement regulates adaptive immune responses by providing longer access of putative APCs to virus-specific effector T cells by prolonging the time frame of effective stimulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Kis-Toth K","Tsokos GC"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1302909","first_seen_on":"2014-04-03T16:44:37+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1550-6606"],"issue":"","journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1396234084,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24670806?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24670806?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/192\/9\/4436.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"24670806","pubdate":"2014-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Engagement of SLAMF2\/CD48 Prolongs the Time Frame of Effective T Cell Activation by Supporting Mature Dendritic Cell Survival.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/engagement-slamf2cd48-prolongs-time-frame-effective-t-cell-activation-supporting-mature-dendritic-ce"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":3964873,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3823162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176278,"mean":7.4110645971967,"rank":77655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":92952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176278,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7271,"mean":2.7047675378267,"rank":3513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7271,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":3.2102481751825,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
