The simulation result shows that, under resonant and non-resonant excitations, the strongest plasmonic electric field of 1\u2005nm ta-C coated Ag nanoparticle is not trapped within the ta-C layer but is released to its outside surface, while leaving the weaker electric field inside ta-C layer. Moreover, this outside plasmonic field shows higher intensity than that of uncoated Ag nanoparticle, which is closely dependent on the excitation wavelength and size of Ag particles. These observations are supported by the SERS measurements. We expect that the ability for ultrathin ta-C coated Ag nanoparticles as the SERS substrates to detect low concentrations of target biomolecules opens the door to the applications where it can be used as a detection tool for integrated, on-chip devices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Fanxin Liu","Chaojun Tang","Peng Zhan","Zhuo Chen","Hongtao Ma","Zhenlin Wang"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep04494","first_seen_on":"2014-04-02T10:19:56+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1396422322,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2014\/140328\/srep04494\/full\/srep04494.html"],"pmid":"24675437","pubdate":"2014-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Raman spectroscopy","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Nanoparticles","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Nanophotonics and plasmonics","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Released Plasmonic Electric Field of Ultrathin Tetrahedral-Amorphous-Carbon Films Coated Ag Nanoparticles for SERS","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/released-plasmonic-electric-field-ultrathin-tetrahedralamorphouscarbon-films-coated-ag-nanoparticles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229690,"mean":5.9663798423984,"rank":4607014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229690,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133108,"mean":8.1898256139799,"rank":88982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":24637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133108,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21906,"mean":13.844014608537,"rank":16021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21906,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":698,"mean":8.2433256814921,"rank":492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":698,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
