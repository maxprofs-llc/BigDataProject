Here we review the characteristics, potential causes, and treatments for this condition. Although we focus on nonhuman primates, relevant research on other mammalian species is discussed also, due to the relative paucity of studies on alopecia in the primate literature. We first discuss the cycle of hair growth and explain how this cycle can be disrupted to produce alopecia. Numerous factors may be related to hair loss and range from naturally occurring processes (for example, seasonality, aging) to various biologic dysfunctions, including vitamin and mineral imbalances, endocrine disorders, immunologic diseases, and genetic mutations. We also address bacterial and fungal infections, infestation by parasites, and atopic dermatitis as possible causes of alopecia. Finally, we examine the role of psychogenic factors, such as stress. Depending on the presumed cause of the hair loss, various treatment strategies can be pursued. Alopecia in nonhuman primates is a multifaceted disorder with many potential sources. For this reason, appropriate testing for various disease conditions should be completed before alopecia is considered to be related to stress.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f7b","authors":["Melinda A Novak","Jerrold S Meyer"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-02T15:23:29+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Comparative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1440492696,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2703143\/"],"pmid":"19295051","pubdate":"2009-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for Laboratory Animal Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"18","subjects":["medicine","laboratoryanimalscience"],"title":"Alopecia: Possible Causes and Treatments, Particularly in Captive Nonhuman Primates","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alopecia-possible-causes-treatments-particularly-captive-nonhuman-primates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8005094,"mean":6.7552691735077,"rank":1620569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6372620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8005094,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176106,"mean":7.4120016467451,"rank":37152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":138611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176106,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":2.5810833333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.66666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
