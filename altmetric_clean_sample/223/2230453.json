There is relatively less evidence whether such activations reflect early semantic access or late conceptual re-processing. Here we recorded event-related potentials when participants recognized noun-verb pairs. For Congruent pairs, the verb was the one most commonly associated with the noun (e.g., football-kick). Compared with a control condition, verbs in Congruent pairs showed priming effects in the time windows of 100-150 ms and 210-260 ms. Such activation seems to be specific to body part but not other aspects of the action as similar priming effect was also found when the noun and verb involved different actions though sharing the same body part (e.g., football-jump), documenting for the first time the early activation of body part representations in action concept comprehension.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ac","doi":"10.1016\/j.neulet.2012.01.032","first_seen_on":"2014-04-02T10:33:06+00:00","issns":["03043940"],"journal":"Neuroscience Letters","last_mentioned_on":1396429011,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0304394012000870"],"pmid":"22306088","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Event-related potentials reveal early activation of body part representations in action concept comprehension","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/eventrelated-potentials-reveal-early-activation-body-part-representations-action-concept-comprehensi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229690,"mean":5.9663798423984,"rank":728842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5484322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229690,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133109,"mean":8.1897614568622,"rank":20828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":111879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133109,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2593,"mean":3.1280354938272,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2593,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":5.3242333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
