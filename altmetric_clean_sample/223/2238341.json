Human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) is effective for treatment of humorally mediated neurological autoimmune diseases and has been reported to improve disease outcome in a limited number of NMO patients. Here, we investigated hIgG actions on NMO-IgG pathogenicity using an in vivo rat model of NMO and in vitro assays. In rats administered NMO-IgG by intracerebral injection, the size of neuroinflammatory demyelinating lesions was reduced by ~50% when hIgG was administered by intraperitoneal injection to reach levels of 10-25mg\/mL in rat serum, comparable with human therapeutic levels. In vitro, hIgG at 10mg\/mL reduced by 90% NMO-IgG-mediated CDC following addition of NMO-IgG and human complement to AQP4-expressing cells. The hIgG effect was mainly on the classical complement pathway. hIgG at 10mg\/mL also reduced by up to 90% NMO-IgG-mediated ADCC as assayed with human natural killer cells as effector cells. However, hIgG at up to 40mg\/mL did not affect AQP4 cell surface expression or its supramolecular assembly in orthogonal arrays of particles, nor did it affect NMO-IgG binding to AQP4. We conclude that hIgG reduces NMO-IgG pathogenicity by inhibition of CDC and ADCC, providing a mechanistic basis to support further clinical evaluation of its therapeutic efficacy in NMO.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002897","authors":["Ratelade J","Smith AJ","Verkman AS"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.expneurol.2014.03.004","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T02:17:09+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Experimental Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1395224041,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24636863?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24636863","pubdate":"2014-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Academic Press Inc.","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Human immunoglobulin g reduces the pathogenicity of aquaporin-4 autoantibodies in neuromyelitis optica.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-immunoglobulin-g-reduces-pathogenicity-aquaporin4-autoantibodies-neuromyelitis-optica"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":4192587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123822,"mean":8.1261915184019,"rank":100835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123822,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":906,"mean":3.3231027624309,"rank":761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":906,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":5.2235789473684,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/status\/446228090193457152","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2238341],"posted_on":"2014-03-19T10:14:01+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":221},"tweet_id":"446228090193457152"}]}}
