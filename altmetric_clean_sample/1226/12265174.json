Toward this goal, we employed two publicly available datasets. In the first stage of the study, density coefficients were computed separately by using the Parzen Windowing method for each class of raw attribute data. Then, differences between classes were determined visually by using density coefficients and their related amplitudes. Visual interpretation of the processed data gave more successful classification results compared with the raw data in the first stage. Next the density-amplitude representations of the raw data were classified using classifiers (SVM, KNN and Na\u00efve Bayes). The raw data (time-amplitude) and their frequency-amplitude representation were also classified using the same classification methods. The statistical results showed that the proposed method based on the density-amplitude representation increases the classification success up to 55% compared with methods using the time-amplitude domain and up to 75% compared with methods based on the frequency-amplitude domain. Finally, we have highlighted several statistical analysis suggestions as a result of the density-amplitude representation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Selahaddin Batuhan Akben","Ahmet Alkan"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0163569","first_seen_on":"2016-09-28T17:31:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1475318174,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0163569&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0163569&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FPLoSONE+%28PLOS+ONE+-+New+Articles%29"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0163569.PDF","pmid":"27683252","pubdate":"2016-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0163569","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Visual Interpretation of Biomedical Time Series Using Parzen Window-Based Density-Amplitude Domain Transformation","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visual-interpretation-biomedical-time-series-using-parzen-windowbased-densityamplitude-domain-transf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":4272457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3966023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253046,"mean":12.718049690766,"rank":128614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":115100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253046,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116460,"mean":10.67913983462,"rank":61715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":49131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116460,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4131,"mean":10.348859564165,"rank":2333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4131,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/neuropapersbot\/statuses\/781184503205076995","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12265174],"posted_on":"2016-09-28T17:31:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Neuroscience Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"hi there, I am a twitter bot who tweets new papers in neuroscience","id_on_source":"neuropapersbot","tweeter_id":"757895584317440000","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":23},"tweet_id":"781184503205076995"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/leon_eckervall\/statuses\/782167232545599488","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12265174],"posted_on":"2016-10-01T10:36:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Leon Eckervall","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/736831020448677888\/gD-00Sk0_normal.jpg","description":"A SAP Presales academy student.
