Using a mouse model of chronic alcohol feeding, we examined the causal role of endotoxin- and cytokine-responsive Pde4 subfamily b (Pde4b) expression in alcohol-induced neuro-inflammation. Both pharmacologic and genetic approaches were used to determine the regulatory role of Pde4b. In C57Bl\/6 wild type (WT) alcohol fed (WT-AF) animals, alcohol significantly induced peripheral endotoxemia and Pde4b expression in brain tissue, accompanied by a decrease in cAMP levels. Further, along with Pde4b, there was a robust activation of astrocytes and microglia accompanied by significant increases in the inflammatory cytokines (Tnf\u03b1, Il-1\u03b2, Mcp-1 and Il-17) and the generalized inflammatory marker Cox-2. At the cellular level, alcohol and inflammatory mediators, particularly LPS, Tnf\u03b1 and Hmgb1 significantly activated microglial cells (Iba-1 expression) and selectively induced Pde4b expression with a minimal to no change in Pde4a and d isoforms. In comparison, the alcohol-induced decrease in brain cAMP levels was completely inhibited in WT mice treated with the Pde4 specific pharmacologic inhibitor rolipram and in Pde4b-\/- mice. Moreover, all the observed markers of alcohol-induced brain inflammation were markedly attenuated. Importantly, glial cell activation induced by systemic endotoxemia (LPS administration) was also markedly decreased in Pde4b-\/- mice. Taken together, these findings strongly support the notion that Pde4b plays a critical role in coordinating alcohol-induced, peripheral endotoxemia mediated neuro-inflammation and could serve as a significant therapeutic target.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a0","authors":["Avila, Diana V.","Myers, Scott A.","Zhang, JingWen","Kharebava, Giorgi","McClain, Craig J.","Kim, Hee-Yong","Whittemore, Scott R.","Gobejishvili, Leila","Barve, Shirish"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropharm.2017.08.011","first_seen_on":"2017-08-15T18:14:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0028-3908","00283908","1873-7064"],"journal":"Neuropharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1502821027,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0028390817303787?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0028390817303787"],"pmid":"28807677","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pharmacology"],"title":"Phosphodiesterase 4b expression plays a major role in alcohol-induced neuro-inflammation","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":6060279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2020413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181253,"mean":12.377514377772,"rank":117501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":53121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181253,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2033,"mean":5.4002312992126,"rank":1467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2033,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":3.125652173913,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CaymanChemical\/statuses\/897521935378239488","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23866902],"posted_on":"2017-08-15T18:14:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Cayman Chemical","url":"http:\/\/www.caymanchem.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/884437416446185473\/tRZMbBE2_normal.jpg","description":"Helping Make Research Possible","id_on_source":"CaymanChemical","tweeter_id":"50038941","geo":{"lt":42.27756,"ln":-83.74088,"country":"US"},"followers":670},"tweet_id":"897521935378239488"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Phosphodiesterase 4b expression plays a major role in alcohol-induced neuro-inflammation","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1519758804713470&id=194912823864748","license":"public","citation_ids":[23866902],"posted_on":"2017-08-15T18:17:07+00:00","summary":"Phosphodiesterase 4b expression plays a major role in alcohol-induced neuro-inflammation. \n\nHighlights: \n\u2022 Chronic alcohol consumption induces peripheral endotoxemia and inflammation. \n\n\u2022 Chronic alcohol increases brain Pde4b expression and decreases cAMP","author":{"name":"Cayman Chemical","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/194912823864748","facebook_wall_name":"Cayman Chemical","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/194912823864748\/picture","id_on_source":"194912823864748"}}]}}
