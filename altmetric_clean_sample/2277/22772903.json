VEs were defined as the development of recurrent stroke, coronary events, peripheral arterial disease, and death. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings were compared between the groups.\nDuring 105.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029.0\u00a0months of follow up, VEs were developed in 142 patients (29.6%). In univariate analysis, VEs were significantly associated with age, gender, diabetes, renal function, lipid levels, left ventricular function, carotid plaque or IMT. In multivariate analysis, the presence of carotid plaque, diabetes, renal function and male gender were independent predictors of future VEs in the patients with ischemic stroke, but carotid IMT was not a predictor of future VEs. Event free survival was significantly lower in patients with carotid plaque than without carotid plaque on Kaplan-Meier analysis (log rank p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThe present study demonstrated that diabetes, impaired renal function, male gender, and the presence of carotid plaque rather than IMT were independent predictors of future VEs in Korean patients with acute ischemic stroke. Active medical management and careful monitoring for the development of recurrent VEs are strongly recommended in patients with acute ischemic stroke and carotid plaque.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ef","authors":["Hyun Ju Yoon","Kye Hun Kim","Hyukjin Park","Jae Yeong Cho","Young Joon Hong","Hyung Wook Park","Ju Han Kim","Youngkeun Ahn","Myung Ho Jeong","Jeong Gwan Cho","Jong Chun Park"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12947-017-0110-y","first_seen_on":"2017-07-27T19:46:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1476-7120"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cardiovascular Ultrasound","last_mentioned_on":1501190052,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1186\/s12947-017-0110-y","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s12947-017-0110-y"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1186%2Fs12947-017-0110-y.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5525267","pmid":"28738808","pubdate":"2017-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"19","subjects":["diagnosticimaging","cardiology"],"title":"Carotid plaque rather than intima-media thickness as a predictor of recurrent vascular events in patients with acute ischemic stroke","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carotid-plaque-rather-intimamedia-thickness-predictor-recurrent-vascular-events-patients-acute-ische"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282957,"mean":6.9842712712639,"rank":3799594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4400483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282957,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171715,"mean":11.607475395134,"rank":73702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":95105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171715,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206,"mean":2.5064195121951,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":5.14,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/vasolabs\/statuses\/890659561748561921","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22772903],"posted_on":"2017-07-27T19:46:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Joseph Ence","url":"http:\/\/vasolabs.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1301535016\/n685993195_887938_3251_normal.jpg","description":"Vasolabs: Live longer.
