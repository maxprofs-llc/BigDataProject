The application of big data mining in clinical medicine was analyzed in the fields of disease risk assessment, clinical decision support, prediction of disease development, guidance of rational use of drugs, medical management, and evidence-based medicine.\nBig data mining has the potential to play an important role in clinical medicine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e9d","authors":["Zhang","Yue Zhang","Shu-Li Guo","Li-Na Han","Tie-Ling Li","Zhang, Yue","Guo, Shu-Li","Han, Li-Na","Li, Tie-Ling"],"doi":"10.4103\/0366-6999.178019","first_seen_on":"2016-03-04T10:24:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0366-6999"],"issue":"6","journal":"Chinese Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1481556791,"links":["http:\/\/www.cmj.org\/article.asp?issn=0366-6999;year%3D2016;volume%3D129;issue%3D6;spage%3D731;epage%3D738;aulast%3DZhang#.Vtlh7p9rbDw.twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26960378?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26960378","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26960378"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cmj.org\/article.asp?issn=0366-6999;year=2016;volume=129;issue=6;spage=731;epage=738;aulast=Zhang;type=2","pmid":"26960378","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"731","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Application and Exploration of Big Data Mining in Clinical Medicine","type":"article","volume":"129","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-exploration-big-data-mining-clinical-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":3664245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4039001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285550,"mean":10.857018991486,"rank":130563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":144760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285550,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":853,"mean":1.4396924882629,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":853,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.4285714285714,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
