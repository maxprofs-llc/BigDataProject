In the present study, we evaluated the effect of resveratrol on inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of human intestinal Caco-2 and SW480 cell lines. In the LPS-treated intestinal cells, resveratrol dose-dependently inhibited the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA as well as protein expression, resulting in a decreased production of NO. In addition, Toll-like receptor-4 expression was significantly diminished in LPS-stimulated cells after resveratrol pre-treatment. To investigate the mechanisms by which resveratrol reduces NO production and iNOS expression, we examined the activation of inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB) in LPS-stimulated intestinal cells. Results demonstrated that resveratrol inhibited the phosphorylation, as well as the degradation, of the I\u03baB complex. Overall, these results show that resveratrol is able to reduce LPS-induced inflammatory responses by intestinal cells, interfering with the activation of NF-\u03baB-dependent molecular mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000579a","authors":["Panaro MA","Carofiglio V","Acquafredda A","Cavallo P","Cianciulli A"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0007114511007227","first_seen_on":"2012-01-25T09:52:10+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"British Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1327484098,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22251620"],"pmid":"22251620","pubdate":"2012-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol occur via inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-\u03baB activation in Caco-2 and SW480 human colon cancer cells.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiinflammatory-effects-resveratrol-occur-via-inhibition-lipopolysaccharideinduced-nf%CE%BAb-activation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":1786645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2632399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235599,"mean":4.2350886340294,"rank":67575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":162829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235599,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2393,"mean":6.2412056856187,"rank":1277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2393,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":3.2780227272727,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
