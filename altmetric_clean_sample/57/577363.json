Molecular mechanisms underlying the development of heart failure remain elusive. Recently, microRNAs (miRs) have been established as important regulators in cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we reported miR-221 was up-regulated in both transverse aortic constricted mice and patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Forced expression of miR-221 by transfection of miR-221 mimics increased myocyte cell size and induced the re-expression of fetal genes, which were inhibited by the knockdown of endogenous miR-221 in cardiomyocytes. The TargetScan algorithm-based prediction identified that p27, a cardiac hypertrophic suppressor, is the putative target of miR-221, which was confirmed by luciferase assay and Western blotting. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that miR-221 regulated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy probably through down-regulation of p27, suggesting that miR-221 may be a new intervention target for cardiac hypertrophy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bc4","authors":["Wang C","Wang S","Zhao P","Wang X","Wang J","Wang Y","Song L","Zou Y","Hui R"],"doi":"10.1002\/jcb.24075","first_seen_on":"2012-01-28T06:58:00+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Cellular Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1327682494,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22275134?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22275134","pubdate":"2012-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"MiR-221 promotes cardiac hypertrophy in vitro through the modulation of p27 expression.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir221-promotes-cardiac-hypertrophy-vitro-through-modulation-p27-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4695196,"mean":5.7072766843588,"rank":2497595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1558497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4695196,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236445,"mean":4.4913533860029,"rank":103185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":100988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236445,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":956,"mean":1.8027371727749,"rank":388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":956,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":1.2459493670886,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
