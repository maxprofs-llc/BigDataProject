The advances highlighted in this review include evidence that the peanut allergens most important in disease differ in different parts of the world, that early oral exposure to peanuts may decrease the frequency of peanut allergy, while early nonoral exposure may have the opposite effect, that complement activation by peanut constituents appears to promote peanut-induced anaphylaxis and that oral immunotherapy, anti-IgE antibody, and a herbal formulation are promising approaches for the treatment of this disorder.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a4","authors":["Fred D Finkelman"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.coi.2010.10.005","endpage":"788","first_seen_on":"2012-01-28T14:09:27+00:00","issns":["09527915"],"issue":"6","journal":"Current Opinion in Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1350499671,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S095279151000155X"],"pmid":"21051210","pubdate":"2010-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"783","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Peanut allergy and anaphylaxis","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peanut-allergy-anaphylaxis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1688931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2794188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235723,"mean":4.3034417831177,"rank":62659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":171430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235723,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":463,"mean":2.1346233766234,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":463,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.2394736842105,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
