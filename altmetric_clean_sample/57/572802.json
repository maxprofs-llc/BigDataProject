In this nested case-control study, we determined 1) frequency of thymine-adenine (TA)n promoter polymorphism and Gly71Arg mutation in uridine diphosphoglucuronate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene in neonates > or =35-wk gestation presenting with bilirubin levels > or =18 mg\/dL and controls, 2) interaction among (TA)n promoter polymorphism, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene mutations, and peak bilirubin. The number of TA repeats was assessed by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and Gly71Arg mutation by PCR-RFLP. Fifty samples of both mutations were verified with DNA sequencing. One hundred twenty-seven neonates were enrolled (77 hyperbilirubinemics, 50 controls). The incidence of (TA)n polymorphism was higher in babies with hyperbilirubinemia [89.6% vs. 50%, OR 8.63 (95% CI, 3.2-24.1)]. Gly71Arg mutation was not found either in hyperbilirubinemics or controls. A novel polymorphism (Ala72Pro) at codon position 72 of exon 1 was detected in all 50 samples (21 hyperbilirubinemics, 29 controls), which were sequenced. Presence of variant (TA)n promoter (adjusted OR, 10.6; 95% CI, 3.3-34.2), G6PD deficiency (adjusted OR, 20.6; 95% CI, 3.6-117.3), and history of jaundice in sibling requiring phototherapy (adjusted OR, 12.6; 95% CI, 1.1-141.6) were independent risk factors for bilirubin levels > or =18 mg\/dL.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000848b","authors":["AGRAWAL, SUNIL K.","KUMAR, PRAVEEN","RATHI, RITU","SHARMA, NEERAJ","DAS, REENA","PRASAD, RAJENDRA","NARANG, ANIL"],"doi":"10.1203\/pdr.0b013e31819ed5de","first_seen_on":"2012-01-24T20:26:22+00:00","issns":["0031-3998"],"issue":"6","journal":"Pediatric Research","last_mentioned_on":1327436158,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pedresearch\/Fulltext\/2009\/06000\/UGT1A1_Gene_Polymorphisms_in_North_Indian_Neonates.15.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pedresearch\/2009\/06000\/UGT1A1_Gene_Polymorphisms_in_North_Indian_Neonates.15.pdf","pmid":"19430380","pubdate":"2009-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"675","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"UGT1A1 Gene Polymorphisms in North Indian Neonates Presenting with Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ugt1a1-gene-polymorphisms-north-indian-neonates-presenting-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":2017358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231978,"mean":3.9856970389308,"rank":101218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231978,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":668,"mean":3.3881109445277,"rank":352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":668,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.8894814814815,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
