In addition to resting CD4(+) T cells, CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells have been proposed as another reservoir. We obtained bone marrow aspirates from 11 patients on ART who had undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA. HIV-1 DNA was detected in CD4(+) T cells from peripheral blood in all patients and from bone marrow cellular fractions containing T cells in most patients. We did not find HIV-1 DNA in highly purified CD34(+) populations using either a sensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction assay or a coculture assay for replication-competent HIV-1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Durand CM","Ghiaur G","Siliciano JD","Rabi SA","Eisele EE","Salgado M","Shan L","Lai JF","Zhang H","Margolick J","Jones RJ","Gallant JE","Ambinder RF","Siliciano RF"],"doi":"10.1093\/infdis\/jir884","endpage":"1018","first_seen_on":"2012-01-24T21:26:26+00:00","funders":["niaid","nci"],"issns":["1537-6613","0022-1899"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1341273600,"links":["http:\/\/jid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/01\/24\/infdis.jir884.abstract","http:\/\/jid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/205\/6\/1014.short","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22275402","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22275402.1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/01\/24\/infdis.jir884.full.pdf","pmid":"22275402","pubdate":"2012-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1014","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"HIV-1 DNA Is Detected in Bone Marrow Populations Containing CD4+ T Cells but Is not Found in Purified CD34+ Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells in Most Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy","type":"article","volume":"205","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hiv1-dna-detected-bone-marrow-populations-containing-cd4-t-cells-not-found-purified-cd34-hematopoiet-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059414,"mean":6.8395785174396,"rank":1946249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6074898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059414,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251364,"mean":5.151601643838,"rank":58973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":190778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251364,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6241,"mean":6.7179557692308,"rank":1838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":4349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6241,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217,"mean":8.482787037037,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
