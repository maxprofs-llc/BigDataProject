In the current study the ability to search for autobiographical information in memory was examined by having college students recall their Facebook friends. Individual differences in working memory capacity manifested itself in the search of autobiographical memory by way of the total number of friends remembered, the number of clusters of friends, size of clusters, and the speed with which participants could output their friends' names. Although working memory capacity was related to the ability to search autobiographical memory, participants did not differ in the manner in which they approached the search and used contextual cues to help query their memories. These results corroborate recent theorising, which suggests that working memory is a necessary component of self-generating contextual cues to strategically search memory for autobiographical information.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d83cf058f610001334","authors":["Unsworth N","Spillers GJ","Brewer GA"],"doi":"10.1080\/09658211.2011.651087","first_seen_on":"2012-01-28T21:49:09+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Memory","last_mentioned_on":1340481756,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22273543?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22273543"],"pmid":"22273543","pubdate":"2012-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The role of working memory capacity in autobiographical retrieval: Individual differences in strategic search.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-working-memory-capacity-autobiographical-retrieval-individual-differences-strategic-search"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4695196,"mean":5.7072766843588,"rank":2168896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2407786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4695196,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236445,"mean":4.4913502140044,"rank":83076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":144897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236445,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":361,"mean":6.3755111111111,"rank":226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":361,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":3.248,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
