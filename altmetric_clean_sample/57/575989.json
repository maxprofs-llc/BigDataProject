Thirty children with beta-thalassemia were selected from the Pediatric Department at Assiut University hospital. Another 40 healthy children of the same age, sex, years of schooling, body mass index (BMI), and social scale were chosen as the control group. Assessment of clinical, laboratory, cognitive functions, and event related potential was done for patients and control groups. Significantly higher levels of ferritin and serum transferrin receptors with decreased nitric oxide were detected among children with beta-thalassemia. There were significant correlations between serum transferrin receptors and nitric oxide levels with event related potential latencies and with some cognitive function tests and P300-N2 amplitude. Frequent blood transfusion was associated with increased serum transferrin receptors and decreased nitric oxide levels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c9e","authors":["G.
