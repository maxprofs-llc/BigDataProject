Animal studies show that histaminergic modulation may affect the pathological processes involved in the generation of ET. Histamine-3 receptor inverse agonists (H3RIA) have demonstrated attenuating effects on ET in the harmaline rat model. In this double-blind, three-way cross-over, single-dose, double-dummy study the effects of 25 mg of a novel H3RIA (MK-0249) and a stable alcohol level (0.6 g L(-1)) were compared with placebo, in 18 patients with ET. Tremor was evaluated using laboratory tremorography, portable tremorography and a clinical rating scale. The Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) and a choice reaction time (CRT) test were performed to evaluate potential effects on sleep and attention, respectively. A steady state of alcohol significantly diminished tremor as assessed by laboratory tremorography, portable tremorography and clinical ratings compared with placebo. A high single MK-0249 dose was not effective in reducing tremor, but caused significant effects on the LSEQ and the CRT test. These results suggest that treatment with a single dose of MK-0249 does not improve tremor in alcohol-responsive patients with ET, whereas stable levels of alcohol as a positive control reproduced the commonly reported tremor-diminishing effects of alcohol.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002eeb","authors":["RWM Zoethout","R Iannone","BR Bloem","J Palcza","G Murphy","J Chodakewitz","A Buntinx","K Gottesdiener","S Marsilio","L Rosen","K van Dyck","ED Louis","AF Cohen","RC Schoemaker","S Tokita","N Sato","KS Koblan","RH Hargreaves","JJ Renger","JMA van Gerven"],"doi":"10.1177\/0269881111398685","endpage":"302","first_seen_on":"2012-01-28T14:03:05+00:00","issns":["1461-7285","0269-8811"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1327758638,"links":["http:\/\/jop.sagepub.com\/content\/26\/2\/292.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jop.sagepub.com\/content\/26\/2\/292.full.pdf","pmid":"21335358","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"292","subjects":["psychopharmacology"],"title":"The effects of a novel histamine-3 receptor inverse agonist on essential tremor in comparison to stable levels of alcohol","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-novel-histamine3-receptor-inverse-agonist-essential-tremor-comparison-stable-levels-alcohol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632750,"mean":4.9231796234803,"rank":2015198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632750,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232366,"mean":3.957576872593,"rank":100901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232366,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":638,"mean":8.375579277865,"rank":428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":638,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":7.1453684210526,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
