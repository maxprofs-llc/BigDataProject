The polymorphic region 5-HTTLPR in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been shown to modulate MDD risk, but the neural underpinnings are incompletely understood.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E0564J","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Rune Jonassen","Tor Endestad","Alexander Neumeister","Kari Bente Foss Haug","Jens Petter Berg","Nils Inge Landr\u00f8"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0030564","first_seen_on":"2012-01-23T22:31:57+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1327875009,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0030564?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FMentalHealth+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+Mental+Health%29","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0030564"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0030564.pdf","pmid":"22291990","pubdate":"2012-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e30564","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Serotonin Transporter Polymorphism Modulates N-Back Task Performance and fMRI BOLD Signal Intensity in Healthy Women","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serotonin-transporter-polymorphism-modulates-nback-task-performance-fmri-bold-signal-intensity-healt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2327827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1535321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235270,"mean":4.2441299193691,"rank":102387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":96014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235270,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80033,"mean":8.2565004748101,"rank":42590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":28147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80033,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3955,"mean":5.8829888720283,"rank":1825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3955,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
