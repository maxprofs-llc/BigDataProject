The effects of the substitution of Ni and Mn with Mo were investigated for the density of the states, the structure, cycling stability, rate performance and thermal stability by tools such as first principle calculations, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, field-emission SEM, solid state (7)Li MAS nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), elemental mapping by scanning TEM (STEM), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). It was confirmed that high valence Mo(6+) doping of the Li-excess manganese-nickel-cobalt layered oxide in the transition metal enhanced the structural stability and electrochemical performance. This increase was due to strong Mo-O hybridization inducing weak Ni-O hybridization, which may reduce O(2) evolution, and metallic behavior resulting in a diminishing cell resistance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Jin-Hwan Park","Jinsub Lim","Jaegu Yoon","Kyu-Sung Park","Jihyeon Gim","Jinju Song","Hyosun Park","Dongmin Im","Minsik Park","Docheon Ahn","Younkee Paik","Jaekook Kim"],"doi":"10.1039\/c2dt11833e","first_seen_on":"2012-01-29T00:47:03+00:00","issns":["1477-9226","1477-9234"],"issue":"10","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1327594015,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2012\/DT\/C2DT11833E?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2012\/dt\/c2dt11833e","pmid":"22282315","pubdate":"2012-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"3053","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"The effects of Mo doping on 0.3Li[Li0.33Mn0.67]O2\u00b70.7Li[Ni0.5Co0.2Mn0.3]O2 cathode material","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-mo-doping-03lili033mn067o207lini05co02mn03o2-cathode-material"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3561810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235967,"mean":4.3141415288647,"rank":188796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235967,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7988,"mean":0.87506973832478,"rank":4051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7988,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1595,"mean":0.5973964868256,"rank":474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1595,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
