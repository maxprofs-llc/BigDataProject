The study area involves polluted and salted environment (Kujawy region; northern-middle Poland) and Tuchola Forestry (unpolluted control area). We investigated 79 blood samples of volunteers from polluted area and 82 from the control in 2008 and 2009. Lead, cadmium and iron concentrations were measured in whole blood by the ICP-MS method. SOD and CAT activities were measured in serum using SOD and CAT Assay Kits by the standardized colorimetric method. Serum TAS was measured spectrophotometrically by the modified Benzie and Strain (1996) method and FRT concentration-by the immunonefelometric method. Pb and Cd levels and SOD activity were higher in volunteers from polluted area as compared with those from the control (0.0236 mg l(-1) vs. 0.014 mg l(-1); 0.0008 mg l(-1) vs. 0.0005 mg l(-1); 0.137 Um l(-1) vs. 0.055 Um l(-1), respectively). Fe level, CAT activity and TAS were lower in serum of volunteers from polluted area (0.442 g l(-1) vs. 0.476 gl(-1); 3.336 nmol min(-1)ml(-1) vs. 6.017 nmol min(-1)ml(-1); 0.731 Trolox-equivalents vs. 0.936 Trolox-equivalents, respectively), whilst differences in FRT concentration were not significant (66.109 \u03bcg l(-1) vs. 37.667 \u03bcg l(-1), p=0.3972). Positive correlations between Pb (r=0.206), Cd (r=0.602) and SOD in the inhabitants of polluted area, and between Cd and SOD in the control (r=0.639) were shown. In volunteers from both studied environments TAS-FRT (polluted: r=0.625 vs. control: r=0.837) and Fe-FRT (polluted area: r=0.831 vs. control: r=0.407) correlations, and Pb-FRT (r=0.360) and Pb-TAS (r=0.283) in the control were stated. The higher lead and cadmium concentrations in blood cause an increase of SOD activity. It suggests that this is one of the defense mechanisms of an organism against oxidative stress caused by environmental factors, whilst non-enzymatic mechanisms marked by TAS are the main antioxidant defense system in relation with Pb concentration in humans from unpolluted area. Simultaneously, the higher CAT activity and TAS can indicate that these mechanisms play a key role in the antioxidant protection in non-stressed environments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065db","authors":["Monika Wieloch","Piotr Kami\u0144ski","Anna Ossowska","Beata Koim-Puchowska","Tomasz Stuczy\u0144ski","Magdalena Kuligowska-Prusi\u0144ska","Gra\u017cyna Dymek","Aneta Ma\u0144kowska","Gra\u017cyna Odrow\u0105\u017c-Sypniewska"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ecoenv.2011.11.017","first_seen_on":"2012-01-29T01:00:46+00:00","issns":["01476513"],"journal":"Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety","last_mentioned_on":1327589247,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSCONTENT&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0147651311004155&_version=1&md5=275a09f47729e61272546220224c730f&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22169892","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Do toxic heavy metals affect antioxidant defense mechanisms in humans?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toxic-heavy-metals-affect-antioxidant-defense-mechanisms-humans-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3084122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":968936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235966,"mean":4.2774653190095,"rank":148091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235966,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":456,"mean":2.2459076923077,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":456,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.3777142857143,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
