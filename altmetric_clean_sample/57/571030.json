A(2)B(6)-type [36]octaphyrins were prepared by the cross condensation of the tetrapyrromethane with aryl aldehydes in moderate yields. A(2)B(6)-type [36]octaphyrins bearing 2,4,6-trifluorophenyl, 2,6-dichlorophenyl, and phenyl substituents underwent Cu(II)-metalation-induced fragmentation to give two molecules of AB(3)-type Cu(II) porphyrins. A(2)B(6)-type [36]octaphyrin bearing 3-thienyl substituents underwent thermal N-thienyl fusion reactions to provide a modestly aromatic [38]octaphyrin, which, upon treatment with MnO(2), underwent further N-thienyl fusion and subsequent oxidation to give a nonaromatic doubly N-thienyl fused [36]octaphyrin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Mori, Hirotaka","Aratani, Naoki","Osuka, Atsuhiro"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201100919","endpage":"1346","first_seen_on":"2012-01-23T17:17:59+00:00","issns":["1861-471X","1861-4728"],"issue":"6","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1327338138,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/asia.201100919"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201100919\/pdf","pmid":"22271635","pubdate":"2012-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1340","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of A2B6\u00e2\u0080\u0090Type [36]Octaphyrins: Copper(II)\u00e2\u0080\u0090Metalation\u00e2\u0080\u0090Induced Fragmentation Reactions to Porphyrins and N\u00e2\u0080\u0090Fusion Reactions of meso\u00e2\u0080\u0090(3\u00e2\u0080\u0090Thienyl) Substituents","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-2b-6type-36octaphyrins-copperiimetalationinduced-fragmentation-reactions-porphyrins-nfusio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6384136,"mean":5.9830488738098,"rank":4718618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":947952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6384136,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240217,"mean":4.7547662353883,"rank":152097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240217,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1673,"mean":1.3293935406699,"rank":580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1673,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186,"mean":1.2421513513514,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
