The R46 plasmid had paradoxical effects on mutability: it appeared to enhance the yield of mutants following irradiation with ultraviolet ligh but it reduced the number of mutants detectable in unirradiated cultures. The effects of this plasmid on ultraviolet survival of the wild type and several mutants defective for recombination and repair have been measured and the results, in the main, confirm similar observation by Tweats et al. (1976). Not only is the survival of the strain habouring R46 greater than that of the parent strain in all the cases studied, but the survival of ultraviolet irradiated bacteriophage lambda is also greater.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7063cf058f61000a4e5","authors":["Oliver, P","Stacey, K A","P.
