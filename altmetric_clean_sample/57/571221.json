All children were severely underweight, and 2 died; 1 of them had a matching HBoV2 nucleotide sequence isolated from serum and bocavirus like particles in the cerebrospinal fluid that were observed with electron microscopy. No further pathogens were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Mitui MT","Shahnawaz Bin Tabib SM","Matsumoto T","Khanam W","Ahmed S","Mori D","Akhter N","Yamada K","Kabir L","Nishizono A","S\u00f6derlund-Venermo M","Ahmed K"],"doi":"10.1093\/cid\/cir957","first_seen_on":"2012-01-23T20:05:32+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1327618001,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22238160","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22238160?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"22238160","pubdate":"2012-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Detection of Human Bocavirus in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Children With Encephalitis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-human-bocavirus-cerebrospinal-fluid-children-encephalitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508238,"mean":5.1674528195662,"rank":1777039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2657894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508238,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235279,"mean":4.3472211426486,"rank":68235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":161843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235279,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5263,"mean":5.5568103382744,"rank":2503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5263,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331,"mean":7.5270484848485,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/13485019","license":"public","citation_ids":[571221],"posted_on":"2012-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["new_finding"],"f1000_score":"1"}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/tomicyan\/status\/1.6266780286662E+17","citation_ids":[571221],"posted_on":"2012-01-26T22:46:41+00:00","author":{"name":"\u3068\u307f\u3061\u3083\u3093","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3614968055\/a87835e0c6372ee6eb1b3f672d57555d_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"tomicyan","tweeter_id":"16898887","geo":{"lt":35.19523,"ln":138.361237,"country":"JP"},"followers":2181},"tweet_id":"1.6266780286662E+17"}]}}
