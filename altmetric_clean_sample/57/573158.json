As the social norm to quit smoking has gained hold in the country, the number of e-cigarette users is growing rapidly. This phenomenon should be urgently considered, because of the lack of research that has been conducted to examine the safety of e-cigarettes and its efficacy as a smoking cessation aid. This paper raises several public health concerns on e-cigarettes in South Korea. Uncertain regulations of the government on e-cigarettes are contributing to an increase of e-cigarette users and allowing the e-cigarette industry to circumvent existing regulations. The aggressive marketing activity of this industry is also a core factor that is responsible for the rapid increase of e-cigarette use, in particular among the youth. Following the enforcement of tobacco control, some cigarette smokers may be encouraged to purchase e-cigarettes in order to circumvent the regulations, even though the dual use of e-cigarette and cigarette may be more harmful. Until there is clear evidence of the e-cigarette's safety, it is recommended that the industry's marketing and promotional activities be banned and closely monitored, and public campaigns be initiated to educate the public regarding e-cigarettes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67d3cf058f610009804","authors":["Sungkyu Lee","Heejin Kimm","Ji Eun Yun","Sun Ha Jee","Lee, Sungkyu","Kimm, Heejin","Yun, Ji Eun","Jee, Sun Ha"],"doi":"10.3961\/jpmph.2011.44.6.235","first_seen_on":"2012-01-25T12:03:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1975-8375","2233-4521"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Preventive Medicine & Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1451606400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3249262\/?tool=pmcentrez","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/22143173\/?i=6&from=electronic%20cigarettes","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3961\/jpmph.2011.44.6.235"],"pmid":"22143173","pubdate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Korean Society for Preventive Medicine","startpage":"235","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Public health challenges of electronic cigarettes in South Korea.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/jpmph.org\/journal\/view.php?doi=10.3961\/jpmph.2011.44.6.235","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/public-health-challenges-electronic-cigarettes-south-korea-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7338789,"mean":6.3746790529954,"rank":1188887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6146518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7338789,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247653,"mean":4.8683456059311,"rank":38070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":209393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247653,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":3.640625,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.64,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":2,"Psychology":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SE":1,"US":3,"PH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/hundun\/status\/166509878960066560","rt":["ronp_md"],"citation_ids":[573158],"posted_on":"2012-02-06T13:13:43+00:00","author":{"name":"M Belinda Perez","url":"http:\/\/hundun.blogspot.com","image":"http:\/\/a2.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1597130209\/image_normal.jpg","description":"knowing that no matter what happens, you'll survive You always do.","id_on_source":"hundun","tweeter_id":"15131355","geo":{"lt":62.198448,"ln":17.56622,"country":"SE"},"followers":187},"tweet_id":"166509878960066560"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HMCollab\/statuses\/269107571741306880","license":"public","citation_ids":[573158],"posted_on":"2012-11-15T16:00:19+00:00","author":{"name":"HealthMediaCollab","url":"http:\/\/hmcollab.norc.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877568698386493440\/_WouSkbh_normal.jpg","description":"Research where #publichealth and #datascience meet.
