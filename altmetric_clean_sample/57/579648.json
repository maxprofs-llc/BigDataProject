In addition, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) was offered as a triage test for women with a diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). HPV testing was recommended within 3 months of ASC-US diagnosis. According to protocol, HPV negative women were referred to regular screening including a cytological exam every 3 years while HPV positive women were referred to colposcopy and closer follow-up. We evaluated the implementation of the protocol and the prediction of HPV testing as a triage tool for cervical intraepithelial lesions grade two or worse (CIN2+) in women with a cytological diagnosis of ASC-US.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Raquel Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","Raquel Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","Judit Moreno-Crespi","Montserrat Sard\u00e0","Josefina Autonell","Montserrat Fibla","Cristina Guti\u00e9rrez","Belen Lloveras","Mar\u00eda Alejo","Isabel Catal\u00e0","Francesc Alameda","Miquel Casas","F Xavier Bosch","Silvia de Sanjos\u00e9"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2334-12-25","first_seen_on":"2012-01-28T22:57:04+00:00","issns":["","1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1327607481,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2334\/12\/25\/abstract"],"pmid":"22280073","pubdate":"2012-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"25","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Prediction of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) using HPV DNA testing after a diagnosis of atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (ASC-US) in Catalonia, Spain","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prediction-cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-grade-2-cin2-using-hpv-dna-testing-after-diagnosis-aty-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4702736,"mean":5.7127972403309,"rank":3335334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":763513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4702736,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236494,"mean":4.4941304478359,"rank":147548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236494,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2571,"mean":2.9613750972763,"rank":1832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2571,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":2.1086575342466,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
