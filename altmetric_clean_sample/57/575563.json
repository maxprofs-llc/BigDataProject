This in vitro assay, unlike all others, measures the ability of drugs to indirectly protect red blood cells (RBCs) from Plasmodium-falciparum-induced destruction. Optimum incubation time and number of cells needed were 5 days and 23 \u00d7 10(6) RBCs per well, respectively. A parasitemia range of 0.375% to 3% was found to be suitable for this assay. The MTT-based CSA determined anti-P. falciparum strain DD2 activity of chloroquine at a higher 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) value (21.0\u2009\u03bcg\/mL) than the isotopic microtest (10.0\u2009\u03bcg\/mL). Artesunate and oxytetracycline achieved 90% effect against DD2 with minimal or no toxicity to RBCs. Against chloroquine sensitive strain 3D7, chloroquine and Alchornea cordifolia had EC(50) values of 0.025\u2009\u03bcg\/mL and 4.9\u2009\u03bcg\/mL respectively, and selective index (SI) values of >2,000 and >69.4\u2009\u03bcg\/mL, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f6100041ab","authors":["Ekuban, Fred"],"doi":"10.4061\/2011\/816250","first_seen_on":"2012-01-27T21:47:28+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Malaria Research & Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1322817686,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/mrt\/2011\/816250\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/mrt\/2011\/816250.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3265290","pmid":"22312574","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Plasmodium falciparum: Assessment of Selectivity of Action of Chloroquine, Alchornea cordifolia, Ficus polita, and Other Drugs by a Tetrazolium-Based Colorimetric Assay","type":"article","volume":"2011","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasmodium-falciparum-assessment-selectivity-action-chloroquine-alchornea-cordifolia-ficus-polita-ot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":3109173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1012334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235782,"mean":4.2364091593473,"rank":148847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":59553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235782,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.0481481481481,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.0083333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
