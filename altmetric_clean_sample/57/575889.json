In these patients, small round cells of unknown origin expressing SOX-2 marker of pluripotency were observed among the epithelial cells just after the ovarian surface epithelium scraping. These cells were an integral part of the ovarian surface epithelium. When the scraped cells were cultured in a medium with added follicular fluid to provide some ovarian niche, primitive oocyte-like cells and typical round-shaped cell clusters positively stained on alkaline phosphatase, and markers of pluripotency, such as SOX-2 and SSEA-4, were developed. These markers were expressed early and also later in the culture. Single oocyte-like cells expressed genes OCT4A, SOX-2, NANOG, NANOS, STELLA, CD9, LIN28, KLF4, GDF3, and MYC, characteristic for pluripotent stem cells. The results of this study confirmed the presence of putative stem cells in the ovarian surface epithelium of these patients and provided some basis to create a stem cell line in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd1","authors":["Sinkovec, Jasna"],"doi":"10.1155\/2011\/381928","first_seen_on":"2012-01-27T22:50:45+00:00","issns":["1110-7243"],"journal":"Journal of Biomedicine & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1340518400,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/jbb\/2011\/381928\/abs\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/jbb\/2011\/381928.pdf","pmid":"22187524","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biotechnology"],"title":"Ovarian Surface Epithelium in Patients with Severe Ovarian Infertility: A Potential Source of Cells Expressing Markers of Pluripotent\/Multipotent Stem Cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ovarian-surface-epithelium-patients-severe-ovarian-infertility-potential-source-cells-expressing-mar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2305636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1592007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235790,"mean":4.3097676906051,"rank":101711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":100865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235790,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":351,"mean":3.1774457142857,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":351,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":3.6354852941176,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
