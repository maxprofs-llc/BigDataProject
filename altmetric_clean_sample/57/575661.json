A new body of evidence suggests that caveolin-2 plays an important, and often more direct, role than caveolin-1 in regulating signaling and function in a cell- and tissue type-specific manner. The purpose of this paper is to primarily focus on discussing how these recent discoveries may help better understand the specific contribution of caveolin-2 to lipid raft- and caveolae-regulated cell\/tissue-specific signaling and functions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f6100039b4","authors":["Sowa, Grzegorz"],"doi":"10.1155\/2011\/809259","first_seen_on":"2012-01-27T21:58:01+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["2090-2247"],"journal":"Biochemistry Research International","last_mentioned_on":1324415923,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/bcri\/2011\/809259\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/bcri\/2011\/809259.pdf","pmid":"22229094","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Novel Insights into the Role of Caveolin-2 in Cell- and Tissue-Specific Signaling and Function","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-insights-role-caveolin2-cell-tissuespecific-signaling-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":3109196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1015536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235782,"mean":4.236363625568,"rank":149224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":59861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235782,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.0590697674419,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.1525,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
