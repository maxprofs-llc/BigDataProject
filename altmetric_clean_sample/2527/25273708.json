As of yet it is unclear how this association evolves over the life span. To that purpose, we continuously recorded mean arterial pressure (MAP; finger plethysmography), CO (pulse contour; CO-trek), mean blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCAV; transcranial Doppler ultrasonography), and end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PetCO2) in healthy young (19-27\u00a0years), middle-aged (51-61\u00a0years), and elderly subjects (70-79\u00a0years). Decreases and increases in CO were accomplished using lower body negative pressure and dynamic handgrip exercise, respectively. Aging in itself did not alter dynamic cerebral autoregulation or cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity. A linear relation between changes in CO and MCAVmean was observed in middle-aged (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and elderly (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) subjects but not in young (P\u00a0=\u00a00.45) subjects, taking concurrent changes in MAP and PetCO2 into account. These data imply that with aging, brain perfusion becomes increasingly dependent on CO.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc92a83ee27268b4594","authors":["Anne\u2010Sophie G. T.
