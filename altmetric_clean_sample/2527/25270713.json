We aimed to assess the prospective association of CRP with VTE risk. C-reactive protein was measured in serum samples at baseline from 2420 men aged 42-61\u00a0years, from the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease study. Within-person variability in CRP levels was corrected for using repeat measurements of CRP taken 11\u00a0years after baseline. Incident VTE events (n\u00a0=\u00a0119) were recorded during a median follow-up of 24.7\u00a0years. The age-adjusted regression dilution ratio for loge CRP was 0.57 [95% confidence interval (CIs): 0.51-0.64]. In age-adjusted Cox regression analysis, the hazard ratio (95% CIs) for VTE per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in loge baseline CRP was 1.17 (0.98-1.40). Further adjustment for several established and emerging risk factors did not alter the association. In a meta-analysis of nine population-based studies (including the current study) comprising 81,625 participants and 2225 VTE cases, the fully-adjusted risk estimate for VTE was 1.14 (1.08-1.19) per SD increase in loge baseline CRP. In a pooled dose-response analysis, a linear association between CRP and VTE risk was suggested (P for nonlinearity\u00a0=\u00a00.272). The pooled risk estimate for VTE per 5\u00a0mg\/l increment in CRP levels was 1.23 (1.09-1.38). C-reactive protein was only modestly associated with VTE risk in the primary analysis. Pooled evidence, however, suggests that elevated CRP is associated with greater VTE risk, consistent with a linear dose-response relationship.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000734b","authors":["Setor K.
