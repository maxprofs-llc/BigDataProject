The non-motile, rod-shaped cells were Gram-negative and non-sporulating. Growth was observed between 15 and 37 \u00b0C (optimum 33 \u00b0C; 3.2 h doubling time) and between pH 5.4 and 8.6 (optimum pH 6.0). The isolate was a strictly anaerobic chemolithoautotroph capable of using molecular hydrogen as the sole energy source and carbon dioxide as the sole carbon source. The G + C content of genomic DNA was 42.6 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the novel isolate belonged to the genus Sulfurovum and was closely related to Sulfurovum sp. NBC37-1 and S. lithotrophicum 42BKT(T) (95.6 % and 95.4 % sequence similarity, respectively). DNA-DNA hybridization demonstrated that the novel isolate could be differentiated genotypically from Sulfurovum sp. NBC37-1 and S. lithotrophicum 42BKT(T). On the basis of the molecular and physiological traits of the new isolate, the name Sulfurovum aggregans sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain Monchim33(T) (=JCM 19824(T) =DSM 27205(T)).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Sayaka Mino","Hideaki Kudo","Arai Takayuki","Tomoo Sawabe","Ken Takai","Satoshi Nakagawa"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijs.0.065094-0","first_seen_on":"2014-06-27T15:49:14+00:00","issns":["1466-5034"],"journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1414752879,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24966202?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/ijs.sgmjournals.org\/content\/64\/Pt_9\/3195.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"24966202","pubdate":"2014-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Sulfurovum aggregans sp. nov., a hydrogen-oxidizing, thiosulfate-reducing chemolithoautotroph within the Epsilonproteobacteria isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimney, and an emended description of the genus Sulfurovum","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sulfurovum-aggregans-sp-nov-hydrogenoxidizing-thiosulfatereducing-chemolithoautotroph-within-epsilon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2317466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2591879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123684,"mean":8.0156945255211,"rank":50774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":69090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123684,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2390,"mean":2.4911276684805,"rank":1401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2390,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":0.95696202531646,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
