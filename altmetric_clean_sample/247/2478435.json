Indeed, resident stem cells are believed to participate to tissue homeostasis and renewal in healthy and damaged myocardium although their actual contribution to these processes remain unclear. The poor outcome in terms of cardiac regeneration following tissue damage point out at the need for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling CPC behavior and fate determination before new therapeutic strategies can be developed. The regulation of cardiac resident stem cell fate and function is likely to result from the interplay between pleiotropic signaling pathways as well as tissue- and cell-specific regulators. Such a modular interaction-which has already been described in the nucleus of a number of different cells where transcriptional complexes form to activate specific gene programs-would account for the unique responses of cardiac progenitors to general and tissue-specific stimuli. The study of the molecular determinants involved in cardiac stem\/progenitor cell regulatory mechanisms may shed light on the processes of cardiac homeostasis in health and disease and thus provide clues on the actual feasibility of cardiac cell therapy through tissue-specific progenitors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc19","authors":["Pagliari, Stefania","Jelinek, Jakub","Grassi, Gabriele","Forte, Giancarlo"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphys.2014.00219","first_seen_on":"2014-07-01T09:06:00+00:00","issns":["","1664-042X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1404205526,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fphys.2014.00219\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fphys.2014.00219\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4076671","pmid":"25071583","pubdate":"2014-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Targeting pleiotropic signaling pathways to control adult cardiac stem cell fate and function","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeting-pleiotropic-signaling-pathways-control-adult-cardiac-stem-cell-fate-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3579155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107382,"mean":7.8264851137541,"rank":82972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107382,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1508,"mean":3.1417770404778,"rank":961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1508,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":2.48794,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
