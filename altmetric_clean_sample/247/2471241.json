In order to determine whether the coordination mode is dependent on the oxidation state of the metal, some +2 metal complexes, (tPCH\u2550CHP)CoCl2 and (tPCH\u2550CHP)FeBr2, were also investigated. The coordination of the olefinic backbone is not observed in (tPCH\u2550CHP)FeBr2, (tPCH\u2550CHP)CoCl2, (tPCH\u2550CHP)Cu(OTf), or [(tPCH\u2550CHP)Ag][PF6], but \u03b7(2)-coordination is present in [(tPCH\u2550CHP)CoCl][BAr(F)4], [(tPCH\u2550CHP)FeBr][BAr(F)4], (tPCH\u2550CHP)CoCl, (tPCH\u2550CHP)CoCl(CO), (tPCH\u2550CHP)RhCl, and [(tPCH\u2550CHP)Cu][PF6]. Cobalt(II), iron(II), and copper(I) formed complexes with the ligand in both coordination modes. All metal complexes were characterized by multinuclei NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and elemental analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Brittany J.
