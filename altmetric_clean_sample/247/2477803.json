The effects of different insulin therapy regimens on early metabolic, inflammatory and neuronal retinal disease processes such as retinal neuroinflammation and synapse loss have not been extensively investigated. This study compared 3 months non-diabetic and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic Sprague Dawley rats. Diabetic rats received either no insulin treatment, systemic insulin treatment beginning after 1 week uncontrolled diabetes (early intervention, 11 weeks on insulin), or after 1.5 months uncontrolled diabetes (late intervention, 6 weeks on insulin). Changes in both whole animal metabolic and retinal inflammatory markers were prevented by early initiation of insulin treatment. These metabolic and inflammatory changes were also normalized by the later insulin intervention. Insulin treatment begun 1 week after diabetes induction ameliorated loss of retinal synapse markers. Synapse markers and presumably synapse numbers were equivalent in uncontrolled diabetes and when insulin treatment began at 1.5 months of diabetes. These findings are in agreement with previous demonstrations that retinal synapses are lost within 1 month of uncontrolled diabetes and suggest that synapses are not regained with glycemic control and restoration of insulin signaling. However, increased expression of metabolic and inflammatory markers associated with diabetes was reversed in both groups of insulin treatment. This study also emphasizes the need for insulin treatment groups in diabetic retinopathy studies to provide a more faithful modeling of the human condition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002893","doi":"10.1016\/j.exer.2014.06.005","first_seen_on":"2014-07-01T02:41:45+00:00","issns":["00144835"],"journal":"Experimental Eye Research","last_mentioned_on":1404182449,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0014483514001584"],"pmid":"24931083","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Insulin treatment normalizes retinal neuroinflammation but not markers of synapse loss in diabetic rats ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insulin-treatment-normalizes-retinal-neuroinflammation-not-markers-synapse-loss-diabetic-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2125076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2235202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107376,"mean":7.7782624633297,"rank":46487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":56102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107376,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":425,"mean":2.3414764150943,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":425,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.7316,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChrisLynchPSU\/status\/483802373270540288","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2477803],"posted_on":"2014-07-01T02:40:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Christopher Lynch","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"ChrisLynchPSU","tweeter_id":"302096816","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":9},"tweet_id":"483802373270540288"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Insulin treatment normalizes retinal neuroinflammation but not markers of synapse loss in...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=860743497286372&id=218860141474714","license":"public","citation_ids":[2477803],"posted_on":"2014-07-01T02:40:46+00:00","summary":"Dustin R.
