Previous studies have suggested vitamin D to have anti-proliferative effects on tumor cells, whereas PTH may have carcinogenic effects. A cancer disease may influence calcium levels in blood, but less is known about calcium and its potential effect on cancer risk and survival. The aim of this study was to examine pre-diagnostic levels of vitamin D (25OHD), PTH and calcium in relation to survival after breast cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dc8","authors":["Linnea Huss","Salma Butt","Signe Borgquist","Martin Almquist","Johan Malm","Jonas Manjer"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10552-014-0413-3","first_seen_on":"2014-06-28T11:46:02+00:00","issns":["1573-7225","0957-5243"],"journal":"Cancer Causes and Control","last_mentioned_on":1420114308,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10552-014-0413-3","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24952509","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10552-014-0413-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10552-014-0413-3.pdf","pmid":"24952509","pubdate":"2014-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","epidemiology"],"title":"Serum levels of vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and calcium in relation to survival following breast cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-levels-vitamin-d-parathyroid-hormone-calcium-relation-survival-following-breast-cancer-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":1883342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2732906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108859,"mean":8.0186677690203,"rank":37820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":68980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108859,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":831,"mean":4.9729638554217,"rank":365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":831,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":6.5381666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
