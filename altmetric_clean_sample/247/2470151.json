This type of two phase systems, often termed \"digital microfluidics\", find wide ranging applications in chemical synthesis and analysis. To conduct on-chip biochemical analysis, a key step is to be able to merge droplets selectively in order to initiate the required reactions. In this paper, a novel microfluidic chip integrating interdigital transducers is designed to merge multiple droplets on-demand. The approach uses surface acoustic wave induced acoustic radiation forces to immobilize droplets as they pass from a channel into a small expansion chamber, there they can be held until successive droplets arrive. Hence, no requirement is placed on the initial spacing between droplets. When the merged volume reaches a critical size, drag forces exerted by the flowing oil phase act to overcome the retaining acoustic radiation forces, causing the merged volume to exit the chamber. This will occur after a predetermined number of droplets have merged depending on the initial droplet size and selected actuation power.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ac","authors":["Muhsincan Sesen","Tuncay Alan","Adrian Neild"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4lc00456f","first_seen_on":"2014-06-27T12:23:31+00:00","issns":["1473-0189"],"journal":"Lab on a Chip - Miniaturisation for Chemistry & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1403785230,"links":["http:\/\/xlink.rsc.org\/?doi=10.1039\/C4LC00456F"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2014\/lc\/c4lc00456f","pmid":"24972001","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biotechnology"],"title":"Microfluidic on-demand droplet merging using surface acoustic waves","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microfluidic-ondemand-droplet-merging-using-surface-acoustic-waves"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230013,"mean":5.9668566214658,"rank":5294688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230013,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133214,"mean":8.0366650552124,"rank":106747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133214,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1947,"mean":4.2123884892086,"rank":1388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1947,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":18.437764705882,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
