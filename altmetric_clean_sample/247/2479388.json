Check out these cool papers by Takema Fukatsu: or","HZT of biotin gene cluster in bed bug endosymbiont is key player for facultative to obligate symbiotic transitions","Vitamine B7 pathway at the origin of insect-Wolbachia mutualism?","Evolution of Wolbachia nutritional mutualism (PNAS)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Obligate insect-bacterium nutritional mutualism is among the most sophisticated forms of symbiosis, wherein the host and the symbiont are integrated into a coherent biological entity and unable to survive without the partnership. Originally, however, such obligate symbiotic bacteria must have been derived from free-living bacteria. How highly specialized obligate mutualisms have arisen from less specialized associations is of interest. Here we address this evolutionary issue by focusing on an exceptional insect-Wolbachia nutritional mutualism. Although Wolbachia endosymbionts are ubiquitously found in diverse insects and generally regarded as facultative\/parasitic associates for their insect hosts, a Wolbachia strain associated with the bedbug Cimex lectularius, designated as wCle, was shown to be essential for host's growth and reproduction via provisioning of B vitamins. We determined the 1,250,060-bp genome of wCle, which was generally similar to the genomes of insect-associated facultative Wolbachia strains, except for the presence of an operon encoding the complete biotin synthetic pathway that was acquired via lateral gene transfer presumably from a coinfecting endosymbiont Cardinium or Rickettsia. Nutritional and physiological experiments, in which wCle-infected and wCle-cured bedbugs of the same genetic background were fed on B-vitamin-manipulated blood meals via an artificial feeding system, demonstrated that wCle certainly synthesizes biotin, and the wCle-provisioned biotin significantly contributes to the host fitness. These findings strongly suggest that acquisition of a single gene cluster consisting of biotin synthesis genes underlies the bedbug-Wolbachia nutritional mutualism, uncovering an evolutionary transition from facultative symbiosis to obligate mutualism facilitated by lateral gene transfer in an endosymbiont lineage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Naruo Nikoh","Takahiro Hosokawa","Minoru Moriyama","Kenshiro Oshima","Masahira Hattori","Takema Fukatsu"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1409284111","first_seen_on":"2014-07-01T14:42:57+00:00","issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"28","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1505128351,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/06\/25\/1409284111.long","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24982177?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/06\/25\/1409284111.abstract.html?etoc","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/28\/10257.abstract.html?etoc","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/28\/10257.short?rss=1","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/28\/10257.long","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/28\/10257.short","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1409284111","https:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073%2Fpnas.1409284111","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/28\/10257"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/06\/25\/1409284111.full.pdf","pmid":"24982177","pubdate":"2014-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"201409284","subjects":["science"],"title":"Evolutionary origin of insect\u2013Wolbachia nutritional mutualism","type":"article","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolutionary-origin-insectwolbachia-nutritional-mutualism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":42.048,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":42.048},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8397236,"mean":7.0723276090205,"rank":223338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8173925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8397236,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178789,"mean":7.499399724814,"rank":5911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":172878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178789,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46772,"mean":24.504051826987,"rank":5570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":41202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46772,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":905,"mean":52.034495575221,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":905,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":9,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":11,"Scientists":9,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":35,"Student  > Ph.
