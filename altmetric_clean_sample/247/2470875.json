A complex human neurological disease, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), is primarily attributed to the deletion of imprinted snoRNAs in chromosome 15q11-q13. Here we investigated the snoRNA repertoires in the PWS locus of 12 mammalian genomes and their evolution processes. A total of 613 imprinted snoRNAs were identified in the PWS homologous loci and the gene number was highly variable across lineages, with a peak in Euarchontoglires. Lineage-specific gene gain and loss events account for most extant genes of the HBII-52 (SNORD115) and the HBII-85 (SNORD116) gene family, and remarkable high gene-birth rates were observed in the primates and the rodents. Meanwhile, rapid sequence substitution occurred only in imprinted snoRNA genes, rather than their flanking sequences or the protein-coding genes located in the same imprinted locus. Strong selective constraints on the functional elements of these imprinted snoRNAs further suggest that they are subjected to birth-and-death evolution. Our data suggest that the regulatory role of HBII-52 on 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA might originate in the Euarchontoglires through adaptive process. We propose that the rapid evolution of PWS-related imprinted snoRNAs has contributed to the neural development of Euarchontoglires.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yi-Jun Zhang","Jian-Hua Yang","Qiao-Su Shi","Ling-Ling Zheng","Jun Liu","Hui Zhou","Hui Zhang","Liang-Hu Qu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0100329","first_seen_on":"2014-06-27T17:47:01+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1403891197,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0100329","http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0100329"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0100329.pdf","pmid":"24945811","pubdate":"2014-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e100329","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Rapid Birth-and-Death Evolution of Imprinted snoRNAs in the Prader-Willi Syndrome Locus: Implications for Neural Development in Euarchontoglires","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapid-birthanddeath-evolution-imprinted-snornas-praderwilli-syndrome-locus-implications-neural-devel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2125108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2235114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107301,"mean":7.7667985088539,"rank":46597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":55912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107301,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80038,"mean":8.4059968514564,"rank":38190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":37717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80038,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2441,"mean":12.74591147541,"rank":1327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2441,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
