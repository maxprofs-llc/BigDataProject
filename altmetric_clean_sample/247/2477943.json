In such populations, mechanisms favoring reproduction usually find fertile ground, and if these mechanisms reduce longevity, demographers should observe higher postreproductive mortality among highly fertile women. We test this hypothesis using complete female reproductive histories from three large demographic databases: the Registre de la population du Qu\u00e9bec ancien (Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al), which covers the first centuries of settlement in Quebec; the BALSAC database (Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi), including comprehensive records for the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean (SLSJ) in Quebec in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; and the Utah Population Database (University of Utah), including all individuals who experienced a vital event on the Mormon Trail and their descendants. Together, the three samples allow for comparisons over time and space, and represent one of the largest set of natural fertility cohorts used to simultaneously assess reproduction and longevity. Using survival analyses, we found a negative influence of parity and a positive influence of age at last child on postreproductive survival in the three populations, as well as a significant interaction between these two variables. The effect sizes of all these parameters were remarkably similar in the three samples. However, we found little evidence that early fertility affects postreproductive survival. The use of Heckman's procedure assessing the impact of mortality selection during reproductive ages did not appreciably alter these results. We conclude our empirical investigation by discussing the advantages of comparative approaches.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51a3cf058f61000388d","authors":["Gagnon A","Smith KR","Tremblay M","V\u00e9zina H","Par\u00e9 PP","Desjardins B","Gagnon, Alain","Smith, Ken R.","Tremblay, Marc","V\u00e9zina, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","Par\u00e9, Paul\u2010Philippe","Desjardins, Bertrand","Alain Gagnon","Ken R.
