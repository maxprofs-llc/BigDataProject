Forskolin, a PKA activator, significantly increased [(3)H]DHEAS uptake and the mRNA expression levels of organic anion transporter (OAT) 4 and CYP19A1 in choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells, while other steroid sulfate transporters present in the placenta showed no change in expression level. KT5720, a PKA inhibitor, attenuated these effects of forskolin. Accordingly, the PKA pathway appears to play an important role in estrogen synthesis by cooperatively regulating OAT4 and steroidogenic enzymes in syncytiotrophoblasts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008eed","authors":["Tomi M","Miyata Y","Noguchi S","Nishimura S","Nishimura T","Nakashima E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.placenta.2014.06.003","first_seen_on":"2014-06-30T15:51:50+00:00","issns":["0143-4004"],"issue":"","journal":"Placenta","last_mentioned_on":1404143447,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24969759"],"pmid":"24969759","pubdate":"2014-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["obstetrics","embryology","physiology"],"title":"Role of protein kinase A in regulating steroid sulfate uptake for estrogen production in human placental choriocarcinoma cells.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-protein-kinase-regulating-steroid-sulfate-uptake-estrogen-production-human-placental-choriocarc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3569090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107332,"mean":7.7907847499793,"rank":82153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107332,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":711,"mean":1.696785915493,"rank":432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":711,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.78448275862069,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
