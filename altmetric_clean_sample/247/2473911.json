The key mt-nucleoid components responsible for mtDNA condensation are HMG-box containing proteins such as mammalian mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and Abf2p of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To gain insight into function and organization of mt-nucleoids in strictly aerobic organisms, we initiated studies of these DNA-protein structures in Yarrowia lipolytica. We identified a principal component of mt-nucleoids in this yeast and termed it YlMhb1p (Y. lipolytica Mitochondrial HMG-box containing protein 1). It contains two putative HMG-boxes contributing to both DNA-binding and its ability to compact mtDNA in vitro. A phenotypic analysis of a \u0394mhb1 strain lacking YlMhb1p resulted in three interesting findings. First, although the mutant exhibits clear differences in mt-nucleoids accompanied by a large decrease in mtDNA copy number and mtDNA-derived transcripts, its respiratory characteristics and growth at most of the tested conditions are indistinguishable from the wild-type strain. Second, our results indicate that a potential imbalance between subunits of the respiratory chain encoded separately by nuclear and mtDNA is prevented at a (post)translational level. Third, we found that mtDNA in the \u0394mhb1 strain is more prone to mutations, indicating that mtHMG-box containing proteins protect mitochondrial genome against mutagenic events.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007317","authors":["Jana Bakkaiova","Kosuke Arata","Miki Matsunobu","Bungo Ono","Tomoyo Aoki","Dana Lajdova","Martina Nebohacova","Jozef Nosek","Isamu Miyakawa","Lubomir Tomaska"],"doi":"10.1128\/ec.00092-14","first_seen_on":"2014-06-29T12:36:39+00:00","issns":["1535-9786"],"journal":"Eukaryotic Cell","last_mentioned_on":1411033882,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24972935?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/ec.asm.org\/content\/13\/9\/1143.long"],"pmid":"24972935","pubdate":"2014-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"A strictly aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica tolerates a loss of a mitochondrial DNA-packaging protein.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strictly-aerobic-yeast-yarrowia-lipolytica-tolerates-loss-mitochondrial-dnapackaging-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4271945,"mean":5.0539439701644,"rank":3211020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":874907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4271945,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103235,"mean":7.7149715016371,"rank":77234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":21517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103235,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":513,"mean":1.9438515625,"rank":326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":513,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.9114074074074,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
