It involves a [2+2+1] cycloaddition of the ynediamines R2 N\uf8ffC\uf8fdC\uf8ffNR2 (R=Me, Et) with SiI2 (Idip) (Idip=1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin-2-ylidene) to afford the orange-colored, highly water-sensitive 1,1-diiodo-2,3,4,5-tetraamino-1H-siloles SiI2 {C4 (NR2 )4 } (1-I: R=Me; 2-I R=Et). Treatment of 2-I with an excess of SiBr4 afforded after I\/Br exchange the 1,1-dibromo-1H-silole SiBr2 {C4 (NEt2 )4 } (2-Br). The 1H-siloles 1-I, 2-I, and 2-Br were fully characterized and their molecular structures determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The compounds feature a slightly twisted five-membered silacyclopenta-2,4-diene ring and a double\/single C\uf8ffC bond alternation in the diene fragment. Reaction of 2-I with the N-heterocyclic carbene IMe4 (IMe4 =1,3,4,5-tetramethylimidazolin-2-ylidene) leads, after displacement of the iodide groups, to the unprecedented diiodide salt [Si(IMe4 )2 {C4 (NEt2 )4 }](I)2 (3), containing a 1H-silole dication with a four-coordinate Si(IV) center. The crystal structure of 3 reveals similar bonding characteristics for the dicationic 1H-silole to those of the neutral 1H-siloles 1-I-2-Br. Two-electron reduction of 3 with C8 K affords, after elimination of one IMe4 group, the thermolabile, carbene-stabilized 1-silacyclopentadien-1-ylidene Si{C4 (NEt2 )4 }(IMe4 ) (4), which was characterized by elemental analysis and (1) H, (13) C{(1) H}, and (29) Si{(1) H} NMR spectroscopies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Lebedev YN","Das U","Chernov O","Schnakenburg G","Filippou AC","Lebedev, Yury N.","Das, Ujjal","Chernov, Oleg","Schnakenburg, Gregor","Filippou, Alexander C."],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201403108","endpage":"9289","first_seen_on":"2014-07-01T04:11:18+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765","0947-6539"],"issue":"30","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1404178380,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201403108\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/chem.201403108"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201403108\/pdf","pmid":"24939862","pubdate":"2014-06-16T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"9280","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"[2+2+1] Cycloadditions of Bis(dialkylamino)acetylenes with SiI<sub>2<\/sub> (Idip): Syntheses and Reactivity Studies of Unprecedented 2,3,4,5-Tetraamino-1\u2009H-siloles.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/221-cycloadditions-bisdialkylaminoacetylenes-sii-sub2sub-idip-syntheses-reactivity-studies-unprecede"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6396843,"mean":5.9825057486175,"rank":637938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":5750359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6396843,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147767,"mean":7.7072934910604,"rank":19262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":128301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147767,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3014,"mean":3.5469266511782,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":2764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3014,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":3.7478028169014,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemEurJ\/status\/479259075335966720","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2477941],"posted_on":"2014-06-18T13:47:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Chemistry","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1002\/(ISSN)1521-3765","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/669149218846720000\/C7lWCugX_normal.jpg","description":"Chemistry - A European Journal\r\nMultidisciplinary Chemistry Journal from ChemPubSoc Europe","id_on_source":"ChemEurJ","tweeter_id":"1522831152","geo":{"lt":49.54887,"ln":8.66697,"country":"DE"},"followers":3518},"tweet_id":"479259075335966720"}],"news":[{"title":"A Silicon Twist","url":"http:\/\/www.chemistryviews.org\/details\/ezine\/6326581\/A_Silicon_Twist.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[2477941,2477941],"posted_on":"2014-07-01T01:33:00+00:00","summary":"Simple route to polyamino-substituted 1H-siloles - important components of LED and other electronic materials","author":{"name":"ChemistryViews","url":"http:\/\/www.chemistryviews.org\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/074\/normal\/image.png?1369859403"}}]}}
