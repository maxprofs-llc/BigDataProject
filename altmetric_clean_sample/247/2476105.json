Because next-generation sequencing generates high-throughput data that allow us to detect genes, it is important to identify genes that drive functional and phenotypic changes of cells. However, conventional methods rely heavily on the assumption of normality and they often give incorrect results when the assumption is not true. To relax the Gaussian assumption in causal inference, we introduce the non-paranormal method to test conditional independence in the PC-algorithm. Then, we present the non-paranormal intervention-calculus when the directed acyclic graph (DAG) is absent (NPN-IDA), which incorporates the cumulative nature of effects through a cascaded pathway via causal inference for ranking causal genes against a phenotype with the non-paranormal method for estimating DAGs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-15-228","first_seen_on":"2014-06-30T15:49:03+00:00","issns":["1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1404206111,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/15\/228\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-15-228.pdf","pmid":"24980787","pubdate":"2014-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"228","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Estimating causal effects with a non-paranormal method for the design of efficient intervention experiments","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estimating-causal-effects-nonparanormal-method-design-efficient-intervention-experiments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3038330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928718,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107339,"mean":7.8387848105986,"rank":70188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107339,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2646,"mean":4.4661209829868,"rank":2201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2646,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":4.2317986577181,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
