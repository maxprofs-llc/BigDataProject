Purinergic receptors are expressed in various cell types in the retina, cochlea, taste buds, and the olfactory epithelium. The activation of these receptors by nucleotides, particularly adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) and its breakdown products, has been shown to tune sensory information coding to control the homeostasis and to regulate the cell turnover in these organs. While the purinergic system of the retina, cochlea, and taste buds has been investigated in numerous studies, the available information about purinergic signaling in the olfactory system is rather limited. Using functional calcium imaging, we identified and characterized the purinergic receptors expressed in the vomeronasal organ of larval Xenopus laevis. ATP-evoked activity in supporting and basal cells was not dependent on extracellular Ca(2+). Depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores disrupted the responses in both cell types. In addition to ATP, supporting cells responded also to uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP) and adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP\u03b3S). The response profile of basal cells was considerably broader. In addition to ATP, they were activated by ADP, 2-MeSATP, 2-MeSADP, ATP\u03b3S, UTP, and UDP. Together, our findings suggest that supporting cells express P2Y2\/P2Y4-like purinergic receptors and that basal cells express multiple P2Y receptors. In contrast, vomeronasal receptor neurons were not sensitive to nucleotides, suggesting that they do not express purinergic receptors. Our data provide the basis for further investigations of the physiological role of purinergic signaling in the vomeronasal organ and the olfactory system in general.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008698","authors":["Katarina Dittrich","Alfredo Sansone","Thomas Hassenkl\u00f6ver","Ivan Manzini"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11302-013-9402-3","first_seen_on":"2014-06-30T08:58:37+00:00","issns":["1573-9546","1573-9538"],"journal":"Purinergic Signalling","last_mentioned_on":1404122151,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11302-013-9402-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11302-013-9402-3.pdf","pmid":"24271060","pubdate":"2013-11-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","biochemistry"],"title":"Purinergic receptor-induced Ca2+ signaling in the neuroepithelium of the vomeronasal organ of larval Xenopus laevis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/purinergic-receptorinduced-ca2-signaling-neuroepithelium-vomeronasal-organ-larval-xenopus-laevis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4018593,"mean":5.0292510539975,"rank":2248216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1036939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4018593,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98958,"mean":7.6366363774165,"rank":52395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98958,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":1.5185797101449,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
