First, informed consent remains a central and critically important issue in clinical ethics. Second, there have been numerous significant legal changes over the past year. We categorize recent legal developments into the following 13 categories: (1) Medical Malpractice Liability, (2) Medical Malpractice Liability in Wisconsin, (3) Medical Malpractice Liability in Novel Situations, (4) Enforcement by Criminal Prosecutors, (5) Enforcement by State Medical Boards, (6) Enforcement through Anti-Discrimination Laws, (7) Statutorily Mandated Disclosures Related to End-of-Life Counseling, (8) Statutorily Mandated Disclosures Related to Aid in Dying, (9) Statutorily Mandated Disclosures Related to Abortion, (10) Statutorily Mandated Disclosures Related to Telemedicine, (11) Statutorily Mandated Disclosures Related to Other Interventions, (12) Statutorily Mandated Gag and Censorship Laws, (13) Informed Consent in the Research Context.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a14","authors":["Thaddeus Mason Pope","Melinda Hexum"],"first_seen_on":"2014-06-28T16:14:45+00:00","issns":["1046-7890"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Clinical Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1418032800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24972066?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=bufferc2a91&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24972066"],"pmid":"24972066","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Legal briefing: informed consent in the clinical context.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/legal-briefing-informed-consent-clinical-context-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4596437,"mean":5.3992147181961,"rank":583487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4009141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4596437,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108036,"mean":8.0020116073495,"rank":16918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":91005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108036,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":3.704488372093,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":5.176,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Med2Meds\/status\/482919914551144448","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2472613],"posted_on":"2014-06-28T16:14:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Med2Meds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3096611195\/abe76ac7fa41a8f791a5d501ac1be664_normal.jpeg","description":"Comunicar, compartir experiencia, consultar...
