Death receptors of the TNFR superfamily regulate cell death and inflammation and are implicated in liver disease and cancer. Liver parenchymal cell-specific ablation of NEMO\/IKK\u03b3, a subunit of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex that is essential for the activation of canonical NF-\u03baB signalling, sensitized hepatocytes to apoptosis and caused the spontaneous development of chronic hepatitis and HCC in mice. Here we show that hepatitis and HCC development in NEMO(LPC-KO) mice is triggered by death receptor-independent FADD-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis. TNF deficiency in all cells or conditional LPC-specific ablation of TNFR1, Fas or TRAIL-R did not prevent hepatocyte apoptosis, hepatitis and HCC development in NEMO(LPC-KO) mice. To address potential functional redundancies between death receptors we generated and analysed NEMO(LPC-KO) mice with combined LPC-specific deficiency of TNFR1, Fas and TRAIL-R and found that also simultaneous lack of all three death receptors did not prevent hepatocyte apoptosis, chronic hepatitis and HCC development. However, LPC-specific combined deficiency in TNFR1, Fas and TRAIL-R protected the NEMO-deficient liver from LPS-induced liver failure, showing that different mechanisms trigger spontaneous and LPS-induced hepatocyte apoptosis in NEMO(LPC-KO) mice. In addition, NK cell depletion did not prevent liver damage and hepatitis. Moreover, NEMO(LPC-KO) mice crossed into a RAG-1-deficient genetic background-developed hepatitis and HCC. Collectively, these results show that the spontaneous development of hepatocyte apoptosis, chronic hepatitis and HCC in NEMO(LPC-KO) mice occurs independently of death receptor signalling, NK cells and B and T lymphocytes, arguing against an immunological trigger as the critical stimulus driving hepatocarcinogenesis in this model.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 27 June 2014; doi:10.1038\/cdd.2014.83.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["H Ehlken","S Krishna-Subramanian","L Ochoa-Callejero","V Kondylis","N E Nadi","B K Straub","P Schirmacher","H Walczak","G Kollias","M Pasparakis"],"doi":"10.1038\/cdd.2014.83","first_seen_on":"2014-06-28T10:07:54+00:00","funders":["wellcome"],"issns":["1476-5403"],"journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1435389844,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24971483?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24971483?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24971483","pubdate":"2014-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Death receptor-independent FADD signalling triggers hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice with liver parenchymal cell-specific NEMO knockout.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/death-receptorindependent-fadd-signalling-triggers-hepatitis-hepatocellular-carcinoma-mice-liver-par"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5281557,"mean":6.213098453185,"rank":3719028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":883410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5281557,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128300,"mean":8.1174818354002,"rank":85214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":25003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128300,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":896,"mean":5.2559798882682,"rank":752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":896,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":3.95,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
