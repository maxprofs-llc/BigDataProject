We have developed novel minimalist linkers containing both an alkyl diazirine and a cyclopropene. We have shown chemical probes made from such linkers could be used for simultaneous in situ imaging and covalent labeling of endogenous BRD-4 (an important epigenetic protein) via a raipd, copper-free, tetrazine-cyclopropene ligation reaction (k2 > 6 M-1 s-1). The key features of our cyclopropenes, with their unique C-1 linkage to BRD-4-targeting moiety, are their tunable reactivity and solubility, relative stability and synthetic accessibility (achievable in a single step from probes containing terminal alkynes).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Zhengqiu Li","Danyang Wang","Lin Li","Sijun Pan","Zhenkun Na","Chelsea Y J Tan","Shao Q Yao"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja502780z","first_seen_on":"2014-06-28T10:39:55+00:00","issns":["1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1403951927,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24972113?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24972113","pubdate":"2014-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\"Minimalist\" Cyclopropene-Containing Photo-Cross-Linkers Suitable for Live-Cell Imaging and Affinity-Based Protein Labeling.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/minimalist-cyclopropenecontaining-photocrosslinkers-suitable-livecell-imaging-affinitybased-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3952868,"mean":5.0303067730227,"rank":3155953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":97407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3952868,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97772,"mean":7.577248493899,"rank":77501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97772,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14156,"mean":4.0551028632025,"rank":11880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14156,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":429,"mean":4.5831822429907,"rank":375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":429,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
