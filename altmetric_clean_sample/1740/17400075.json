Here we report on the characteristics of 125I-SRTXb receptors and their regional distribution in rat brain. 125I-SRTX receptors in the rat brain bind the toxin rapidly and with high affinity. The binding was not inhibited by ligands of known neurotransmitter receptor and ion channels. 125I-SRTX receptors have a distinctive regional distribution. The highest densities were observed in the cerebellum, thalamus and hypothalamus (850, 550 and 450 fmol\/mg protein, respectively) and the lowest densities in the caudate and cerebral cortex (82 and 62 fmol\/mg protein, respectively). Taken together our results suggest that mammalian brains contain a hitherto undetected neuroreceptor that may operate in neurotransmission with a \"SRTX-like\" brain peptide, similar to the SRTX homologous vasoconstrictor peptide of the mammalian endothelium endothelin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Ambar, I","Kloog, Y","Kochva, E","Wollberg, Z","Bdolah, A","Oron, U","Sokolovsky, M"],"first_seen_on":"2017-03-16T10:23:59+00:00","issns":["0006-291X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1489659797,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3207419"],"pmid":"3207419","pubdate":"1988-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Characterization and localization of a novel neuroreceptor for the peptide sarafotoxin.","type":"article","volume":"157","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-localization-novel-neuroreceptor-peptide-sarafotoxin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":2144610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5079823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243630,"mean":13.60859302464,"rank":85969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":154177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243630,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8813,"mean":2.7290615070359,"rank":680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":3663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8813,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171,"mean":1.2791176470588,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
