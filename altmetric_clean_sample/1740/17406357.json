No single case of LBRF has been reported in Europe in refugees from other parts of Africa.\nWe report a case of LBRF in a refugee from Mali, likely acquired in Libya, where several migration routes into Europe meet. The disease must be considered in any febrile refugee regardless the country of origin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000597d","authors":["Cecilia Grecchi","Paola Zanotti","Agostina Pontarelli","Erika Chiari","Lina Rachele Tomasoni","Maurizio Gulletta","Anna Barbui","Silvio Caligaris","Alberto Matteelli","Francesco Castelli"],"doi":"10.1007\/s15010-017-0987-2","first_seen_on":"2017-03-16T11:56:04+00:00","issns":["0300-8126","1439-0973"],"journal":"Infection","last_mentioned_on":1489665351,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28161771"],"pmid":"28161771","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Louse-borne relapsing fever in a refugee from Mali","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s15010-017-0987-2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/louseborne-relapsing-fever-refugee-mali"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":4462309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2328796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243630,"mean":13.608604517524,"rank":139313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":81651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243630,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":583,"mean":3.1622371134021,"rank":385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":583,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":14.438125,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TheLiceMeister\/statuses\/842343654278717440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17406357],"posted_on":"2017-03-16T11:55:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Pediculosis Assoc","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheLiceMeister","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1397584884\/LiceMeistertaketwo_normal.jpg","description":"Nonprofit -- Avoid pesticides for lice by enabling parents with accurate info & effective tools.
