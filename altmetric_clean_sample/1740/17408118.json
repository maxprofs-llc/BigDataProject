Although pathological studies suggest that tau may co-localize with vascular amyloid, this has not yet been investigated in CAA in vivo. Three patients with probable CAA underwent 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET or 18F-florbetaben PET to evaluate amyloid burden, and 18F-AV-1451 PET to evaluate paired helical filament tau burden. Regions that had cerebral microbleeds or cortical superficial siderosis largely overlapped with those showing increased 18F-AV-1451 and increased 11C-PiB uptake. Our preliminary study raised the possibility that lobar cerebral microbleeds, and cortical superficial siderosis, which are characteristic markers of vascular amyloid, may be associated with local production of paired helical filament tau.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Kim, Hee Jin","Cho, Hanna","Werring, David J.","Jang, Young Kyoung","Kim, Yeo Jin","Lee, Jin San","Lee, Juyoun","Jun, Soomin","Park, Seongbeom","Ryu, Young Hoon","Choi, Jae Yong","Cho, Young Seok","Moon, Seung Hwan","Na, Duk L.","Lyoo, Chul Hyoung","Seo, Sang Won","Hee Jin Kim","Hanna Cho","David J.
