However, little is known about the types of strategies that women are interested in using to address these sexual issues. This study used a reliable and valid instrument, the Sexual Function Questionnaire, to assess survivors' sexual function. Data were collected from 115 women who were younger than 50 years at diagnosis. Compared to normative controls, survivors scored significantly lower, indicating lower functioning, on most subscales of the Sexual Function Questionnaire and the overall measure, with the exception of the masturbation subscale on which they scored significantly higher. Most participants indicated moderate or strong interest in sexual enhancement products and comfort purchasing sexual enhancement products through various venues. Nurses and other health professionals might consider collaborations with entities of the adult retail industry to provide survivors with information about sexual enhancement products and their therapeutic potential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057c9","authors":["Herbenick, Debra","Reece, Michael","Hollub, Ariane","Satinsky, Sonya","Dodge, Brian"],"doi":"10.1097\/01.ncc.0000339252.91194.6c","first_seen_on":"2017-03-16T11:28:30+00:00","issns":["0162-220X","1538-9804"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cancer nursing (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1490634785,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cancernursingonline\/Abstract\/2008\/11000\/Young_Female_Breast_Cancer_Survivors__Their_Sexual.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cancernursingonline\/2008\/11000\/Young_Female_Breast_Cancer_Survivors__Their_Sexual.3.pdf","pmid":"18987508","pubdate":"2008-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"417","subjects":["nursing","neoplasms"],"title":"Young Female Breast Cancer Survivors: Their Sexual Function and Interest in Sexual Enhancement Products and Services","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cancernursingonline\/Fulltext\/2008\/11000\/Young_Female_Breast_Cancer_Survivors__Their_Sexual.3.aspx","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/young-female-breast-cancer-survivors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":34,"score_history":{"1y":34,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":34},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":273122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":8149009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244773,"mean":13.623248713088,"rank":16683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":228072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244773,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":736,"mean":2.3883129251701,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":736,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":3.0884615384615,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
