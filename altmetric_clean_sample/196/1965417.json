The Portrait Toxigenic C. difficile assay combines novel blocked-primer-mediated helicase-dependent multiplex amplification (bpHDA) technology and chip-based detection in an automated sample-to-result format. The assay requires minimal sample preparation and results are available within 90 min. In a multicenter evaluation, the Portrait Toxigenic C. difficile assay had a sensitivity of 98.2% and specificity of 92.8% compared with toxigenic culture. A comparative study between the Portrait Toxigenic C. difficile assay and three FDA-cleared molecular assays for the detection of toxigenic C. difficile exhibited a high degree of agreement (93.8-97.5%). The Portrait Toxigenic C. difficile assay provides a simple, cost-effective method with broad applicability to panel-based approaches, potentially simplifying workflow.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d4","authors":["Gerald A Denys"],"doi":"10.1586\/14737159.2014.864239","first_seen_on":"2013-12-09T08:54:15+00:00","issns":["1744-8352"],"journal":"Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics","last_mentioned_on":1386579248,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24308336?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24308336","pubdate":"2013-11-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Portrait Toxigenic Clostridium difficile assay, an isothermal amplification assay detects toxigenic C. difficile in clinical stool specimens.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/portrait-toxigenic-iclostridium-difficilei-assay-isothermal-amplification-assay-detects-toxigenic-ic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4201131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132650,"mean":7.3853493505419,"rank":107441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132650,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":334,"mean":1.8972252252252,"rank":261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":334,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.69444444444444,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CDifficile1\/status\/409969198635315200","license":"public","citation_ids":[1965417],"posted_on":"2013-12-09T08:54:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.cdifficile.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1633637124\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"CDifficile1","tweeter_id":"324789063","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":163},"tweet_id":"409969198635315200"}]}}
