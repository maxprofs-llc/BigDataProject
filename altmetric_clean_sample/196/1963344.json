One intriguing hypothesis is that the framework belying sex differences in the brain creates differences in methylation and demethylation patterns, and these in turn confer risk and resilience to mental health disorders. Here, we discuss these concepts with regard to social behaviour in rodent models and briefly discuss their possible relevance to human disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e73","authors":["Kigar, S.
