In this study, we examined ERK1, 2, and 5 expression and activation in the substantia nigra (SN), striatum (STR), and ventral tegmental area (VTA) during aging. An age-related decrease in phosphorylated ERK5 was observed in the SN and STR, whereas an increase in total ERK1 was observed in all 3 regions. In primary cultures of the SN and VTA, inhibition of ERK5 but not ERK1 and 2 decreased dopamine neuronal viability significantly. These data suggest that ERK5 is essential for the basal survival of SN and VTA dopaminergic neurons. This is the first study to examine ERK1, 2, and 5 expression and activation in the SN, STR, and VTA during aging, and the relative roles of ERK1, 2, and 5 in basal survival of SN and VTA dopaminergic neurons. These data raise the possibility that a decline in ERK5 signaling may play a role in age-related impairments in dopaminergic function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000318e","authors":["Mayur S.
