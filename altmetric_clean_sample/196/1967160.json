However, little is known about the toxicological effect of PX-12 on cancer cells. We investigated the anti-growth effects of PX-12 on A549 lung cancer cells in relation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) levels. Based on MTT assays, PX-12 inhibited the growth of A549 cells with an IC50 of approximately 20 \u00b5M at 72 h. DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that PX-12 significantly induced the G2\/M phase arrest of the cell cycle in A549 cells. This agent also induced apoptotic cell death, as demonstrated by Annexin V-FITC staining cells and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential MMP (\u2206\u03c8m). In addition, the administration of Bax siRNA attenuated PX-12-induced A549 cell death. All the tested caspase inhibitors, especially Z-VAD significantly prevented apoptosis induced by PX-12. With respect to ROS and GSH levels, PX-12 increased ROS levels including O2(\u2022)- in A549 cells and induced GSH depletion. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) markedly reduced ROS levels in PX-12-treated A549 cells. NAC also prevented apoptotic cell death and GSH depletion induced by PX-12. This is the first report to show that PX-12 inhibits the growth of A549 cells via G2\/M phase arrest, and Bax-mediated and ROS-dependent apoptosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007977","authors":["Bo Ra You","Hye Rim Shin","Woo Hyun Park"],"doi":"10.3892\/ijo.2013.2152","first_seen_on":"2013-12-10T00:17:47+00:00","issns":["1791-2423"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1386634589,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24172913"],"pmid":"24172913","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"PX-12 inhibits the growth of A549 lung cancer cells via G2\/M phase arrest and ROS-dependent apoptosis.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/px12-inhibits-growth-a549-lung-cancer-cells-via-g2m-phase-arrest-rosdependent-apoptosis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3064700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122679,"mean":7.2841728916353,"rank":80245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122679,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1049,"mean":1.9463511450382,"rank":600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1049,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":0.87741935483871,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
