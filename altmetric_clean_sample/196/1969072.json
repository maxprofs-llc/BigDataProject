We continuously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) and measured plasma corticosterone levels to develop a mouse FNE model by inducing acute insomnia in mice that have been placed in unfamiliar cage environments. The sleep latency of mice 'moved to clean cages' (MCC) was longer than that for mice 'moved to dirty ones' (MDC). As compared to MDC mice, MCC mice showed stronger decreases in the amount of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM, NREM) and REM sleep, with a lower power density of NREM sleep, increased fragmentation and decreased stage transitions from NREM sleep to wake, and higher variation in plasma corticosterone levels. Treatment of MCC mice with zolpidem, diazepam, raclopride, pyrilamine, except SCH23390 shortened NREM sleep latency. In addition, zolpidem significantly increased NREM and REM sleep with the increase in slow wave activity (1.00-2.75 Hz), while raclopride significantly increased NREM and REM sleep without changing the EEG power density in MCC mice, whereas diazepam increased sleep with a drastic decrease in power density of the frequency band between 1.00 and 4.00 Hz, diazepam also increased the frequency band between 9.75 and 24.75 Hz during NREM sleep. These results indicate that a MCC mouse can mimic a FNE phenotype of humans and that zolpidem and raclopride may be useful drugs to prevent acute insomnia, including FNE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e3","authors":["Qi Xu","Xin-Hong Xu","Wei-Min Qu","Michael Lazarus","Yoshihiro Urade","Zhi-Li Huang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pbb.2013.11.029","first_seen_on":"2013-12-10T14:06:26+00:00","issns":["1873-5177"],"journal":"Pharmacology, Biochemistry & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1409308432,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24316349?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24316349","pubdate":"2013-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","behavioralsciences","pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"A mouse model mimicking human first night effect for the evaluation of hypnotics.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mouse-model-mimicking-human-first-night-effect-evaluation-hypnotics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4509149,"mean":5.2377591184699,"rank":3624918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":150458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4509149,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122706,"mean":7.3871578175301,"rank":97771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122706,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1064,"mean":2.7580959548448,"rank":803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1064,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":4.8088333333333,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
