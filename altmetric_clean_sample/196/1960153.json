The NHC-mediated polymerization of TMOSC with 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene (IMes, 1) generates the poly(carbosiloxane) p(TMOSC) with molecular weights from 27,000 < Mn < 80,000 Da (1.4 < Mw\/Mn < 2.2) within 30 min at room temp. With the more nucleophilic carbene 1,3,4,5-tetramethyl-imidazol-2-ylidene (4), the ring-opening polymerization occurs within minutes at room temperature to generate cyclic p(TMOSC) with molecular weights up to Mn = 940,000 Da (Mw\/Mn = 3.2). The resulting p(TMOSC)s are predominantly cyclic as evidenced by dilute solution viscosity studies and MALDI-TOF MS. DFT calculations provide support for both zwitterionic and neutral, cyclic intermediates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Hayley A. Brown","Young A.
