A total of 100 patients diagnosed with OCD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV criteria and 110 control subjects were included in this study. The distribution of a single nucleotide polymorphism rs2883187 was compared in OCD patients and normal controls. Clinical features were compared between the subgroups of OCD patients with different genotypes. There was no significant difference for the allele frequencies and genotype distributions between the OCD and control groups. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale obsession and total scores were found to be higher in patients with the CC genotype than in the patients who are homozygous for the T allele. The rates of OCD in first-degree relatives of OCD patients who were homozygous for the C allele were significantly higher, compared to those with CT and TT genotypes. Our results indicate that the CC genotype may be associated with the severity and increased familial loading of OCD. Further investigation based on larger populations is needed to reveal the full association of the BDNF polymorphism with OCD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bec","authors":["Ra\u015fit T\u00fckel","Berna \u00d6zata","Nalan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk","Banu Aslanta\u015f Ertekin","Erhan Ertekin","G\u00fcher Saruhan Direskeneli"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jocn.2013.07.037","first_seen_on":"2013-12-09T16:02:50+00:00","issns":["09675868"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1386604901,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S096758681300533X"],"pmid":"24291483","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"The role of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor SNP rs2883187 in the phenotypic expression of obsessive-compulsive disorder","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-brainderived-neurotrophic-factor-snp-rs2883187-phenotypic-expression-obsessivecompulsive-disord"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":2016339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112683,"mean":6.9650156724236,"rank":56666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":31495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112683,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":2.0613541666667,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":3.8118461538462,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
