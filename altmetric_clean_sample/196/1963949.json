However, noise and uncontrolled modulatory input can interfere with repeatable delivery of sensory stimuli to higher brain regions. Here we show how channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) can be used to deliver continuous, subthreshold, time-varying currents to neurons at any point along the sensory-motor pathway. To do this, we first deduce the frequency response function of ChR2 using a Markov model of channel kinetics. We then confirm ChR2's frequency response characteristics using continuously-varying optical stimulation of neurons that express one of three ChR2 variants. We find that wild-type ChR2 and the E123T\/H134R mutant (\"CheTA\") can pass continuously-varying subthreshold stimuli with frequencies up to ~70 Hz. Additionally, we find that wild-type ChR2 exhibits a strong resonance at ~6-10 Hz. Together, these results indicate that ChR2-derived optogenetic tools are useful for delivering highly repeatable artificial stimuli that mimic in vivo synaptic bombardment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc12","authors":["Tchumatchenko, Tatjana","Newman, Jonathan Paul","Fong, Ming-fai","Potter, Steve M"],"doi":"10.3389\/fncir.2013.00184","first_seen_on":"2013-12-08T13:35:16+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1662-5110"],"journal":"Frontiers in Neural Circuits","last_mentioned_on":1386509707,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fncir.2013.00184\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/DownloadFile\/1\/125281\/62641\/1\/21\/fncir-07-00184_pdf","pmid":"24367294","pubdate":"2013-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Delivery of continuously-varying stimuli using channelrhodopsin-2","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/delivery-continuouslyvarying-stimuli-using-channelrhodopsin2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4201659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132522,"mean":7.3933591204416,"rank":107388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132522,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":437,"mean":3.3128944954128,"rank":343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":437,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":2.112962962963,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
