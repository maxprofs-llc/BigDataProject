Active targeting is based on surface modification of nanoparticles with ligands that bind with extracellular targets and enhance payload delivery in the cells. In this study, we have used label-free Raman micro-spectral analysis and kinetic modeling to study cellular interactions and intracellular delivery of C6-ceramide using a non-targeted and an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted biodegradable polymeric nano-delivery systems, in EGFR-expressing human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SKOV3) cells. The results show that EGFR peptide-modified nanoparticles were rapidly internalized in SKOV3 cells leading to significant intracellular accumulation as compared to non-specific uptake by the non-targeted nanoparticles. Raman micro-spectral analysis enables visualization and quantification of the carrier system, drug-load, and responses of the biological systems interrogated, without exogenous staining and labeling procedures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6153cf058f610007170","authors":["Tatyana Chernenko","Fulden Buyukozturk","Milos Miljkovic","Rebecca Carrier","Max Diem","Mansoor Amiji","Chernenko T","Buyukozturk F","Miljkovic M","Carrier R","Diem M","Amiji M"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13346-013-0178-3","endpage":"586","first_seen_on":"2013-12-10T01:25:27+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["2190-393X","2190-3948"],"issue":"6","journal":"Drug Delivery and Translational Research","last_mentioned_on":1386637974,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24298430"],"pmcid":"PMC3843494","pmid":"24298430","pubdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmaceutical Sciences\/Technology","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"575","title":"Label-Free Raman Microspectral Analysis for Comparison of Cellular Uptake and Distribution between Non-Targeted and EGFR-Targeted Biodegradable Polymeric Nanoparticles.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/labelfree-raman-microspectral-analysis-comparison-cellular-uptake-distribution-between-nontargeted-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3064700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122679,"mean":7.2841936777583,"rank":80245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122679,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":2.5769787234043,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
