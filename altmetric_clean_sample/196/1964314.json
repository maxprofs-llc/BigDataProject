This study tested the hypothesis that similar misconceptions can be found among superstitious adults. The results from 116 superstitious and 123 sceptical individuals showed that more than sceptics, superstitious individuals attributed purpose to objects, and explained biological processes in terms of organ intentionality and energy transmission. In addition, they thought of energy as a vital force, attributing life and mental properties to it. These conceptual confusions were positively associated to all types of superstitions as well as belief in alternative medicine. The results support the argument that category mistakes and ontological confusions underlie superstitious and vitalistic thinking.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002452","authors":["Marjaana Lindeman","Marieke Saher"],"first_seen_on":"2013-12-08T19:58:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0007-1269"],"issue":"Pt 1","journal":"British Journal of Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1386532704,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17319049"],"pmid":"17319049","pubdate":"2007-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Vitalism, purpose and superstition.","type":"article","volume":"98","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitalism-purpose-superstition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2301801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1603140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122575,"mean":7.2427341034806,"rank":58562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":46584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122575,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":454,"mean":9.1880883002208,"rank":347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":454,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
