The chemically fashioned ZnONR were synthesized by hybrid wet chemical route onto glass substrates and used to fabricate a stable chemiluminescent choline biosensor. The biosensor was constructed by co-immobilization of the enzymes choline oxidase and peroxidase. The covalent immobilization of the enzymes on the ZnONR was achieved using 16-phosphonohexadecanoic acid as a cross-linker. The phosphonation of the ZnONR imparted significant stability to the immobilized enzyme as against physisorbed enzyme. A lower value of Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), of 0.062 mM for the covalently coupled enzyme over the physisorbed enzymes facilitated enhanced stability of ZnONR nanobiosensor. The ZnONR-choline biosensor has been investigated over a wide range of choline from 0.0005 mM to 2 mM. Importantly, the recovery of choline in milk samples was close to 99%. Using the developed biosensor, choline was measurable even after 30 days with 60 repeated measurements proving the stability of the sensor (Intraday RSD%=2.83 and Interday RSD%=3.51).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f7","authors":["Souvik Pal","Manoj Kumar Sharma","Bengt Danielsson","Magnus Willander","Ratnamala Chatterjee","Sunil Bhand"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bios.2013.11.057","endpage":"564","first_seen_on":"2013-12-09T02:11:27+00:00","issns":["09565663"],"journal":"Biosensors & Bioelectronics","last_mentioned_on":1386646821,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0956566313008476"],"pmid":"24325984","pubdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"558","title":"A miniaturized nanobiosensor for choline analysis","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/miniaturized-nanobiosensor-choline-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3555051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":834955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132650,"mean":7.3854428303269,"rank":87936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":25203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132650,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1387,"mean":2.40513997114,"rank":816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1387,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":2.4214285714286,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
