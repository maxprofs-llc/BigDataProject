An investigation of solution association between shikonin and both acidic and basic functional monomers by UV-vis titrations, suggested stronger affinity towards the basic functionality. Strong inhibition of the co-polymerisation reaction of such basic monomers was observed, but was overcome by reduction of the amount of template used during polymer synthesis. Polymer morphology was severely impacted by the template's radical scavenging behaviour as demonstrated by solid state NMR spectroscopy measurements. HPLC evaluation of the final materials in polar conditions revealed limited imprinting effects and selectivity, with the MAA polymers exhibiting marginally better performance. During application of the polymers as MI-SPE sorbents in non-polar solvents it was found that the DEAEMA based polymer was more selective towards shikonin compared to the MAA counterpart, while shikonin recoveries of up to 72% were achieved from hexane solutions of a commercial sample of shikonin, hexane extract of Alkanna tinctoria roots and a commercial pharmaceutical ointment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["Stella K.
