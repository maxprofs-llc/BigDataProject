These predictions are exact for reaction networks composed exclusively of first order reactions or for networks involving bimolecular reactions and large numbers of molecules. It is however well known that gene regulation involves bimolecular interactions with molecule numbers as small as a single copy of a particular gene. It is therefore questionable how reliable are the LNA predictions for these systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Thomas P","Matuschek H","Grima R","Philipp Thomas","Hannes Matuschek","Ramon Grima"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-14-s4-s5","first_seen_on":"2013-12-10T11:12:09+00:00","issns":["1471-2164",""],"issue":"Suppl 4","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1386673903,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/14\/S4\/S5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-14-S4-S5.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3849541","pmid":"24266939","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"S5","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"How reliable is the linear noise approximation of gene regulatory networks?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2164-14-S4-S5","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reliable-linear-noise-approximation-gene-regulatory-networks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6611727,"mean":6.131580845607,"rank":4891450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":970163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6611727,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149551,"mean":7.3416492544301,"rank":99199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":27689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149551,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5201,"mean":3.9522580769231,"rank":4170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5201,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197,"mean":4.3198979591837,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
