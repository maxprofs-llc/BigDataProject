[FEBS J. 2005] - PubMed - NCBI"],"citation":{"abstract":"The State 1 to State 2 transition in the photosynthetic membranes of plants and green algae involves the functional coupling of phosphorylated light-harvesting complexes of photosystem II (LHCII) to photosystem I (PSI). We present evidence suggesting that in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii this coupling may be aided by a hyper-phosphorylated form of the LHCII-like CP29 protein (Lhcbm4). MS analysis of CP29 showed that Thr6, Thr16 and Thr32, and Ser102 are phosphorylated in State 2, whereas in State 1-exposed cells only phosphorylation of Thr6 and Thr32 could be detected. The LHCI-PSI supercomplex isolated from the alga in State 2 was found to contain strongly associated CP29 in phosphorylated form. Electron microscopy suggests that the binding site for this highly phosphorylated CP29 is close to the PsaH protein. It is therefore postulated that redox-dependent multiple phosphorylation of CP29 in green algae is an integral part of the State transition process in which the structural changes of CP29, induced by reversible phosphorylation, determine the affinity of LHCII for either of the two photosystems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b6","authors":["Joanna Kargul","Maria V Turkina","Jon Nield","Sam Benson","Alexander V Vener","James Barber"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1742-4658.2005.04894.x","first_seen_on":"2013-12-08T17:17:32+00:00","issns":["1742-464X"],"issue":"18","journal":"FEBS Journal","last_mentioned_on":1434079134,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16156798"],"pmid":"16156798","pubdate":"2005-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Light-harvesting complex II protein CP29 binds to photosystem I of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under State 2 conditions.","type":"article","volume":"272","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lightharvesting-complex-ii-protein-cp29-binds-photosystem-i-chlamydomonas-reinhardtii-under-state-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5221989,"mean":6.1572936372149,"rank":2767597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1774268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5221989,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134943,"mean":7.4140524818071,"rank":65352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":51667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134943,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2122,"mean":1.5789174917492,"rank":651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":1269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2122,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.0833333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
