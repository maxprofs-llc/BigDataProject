Two different catalytic systems, iridium- or platinum-based, are able to induce this process. Alkyl migrations of larger rings and acyclic groups indicate that the reaction is not fully driven by the release of ring strain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Susan M.
