Here we report that CUTL1 activity is associated with increased migration and invasiveness in numerous tumor cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we identify CUTL1 as a transcriptional target of transforming growth factor beta and a mediator of its promigratory effects. CUTL1 activates a transcriptional program regulating genes involved in cell motility, invasion, and extracellular matrix composition. CUTL1 expression is significantly increased in high-grade carcinomas and is inversely correlated with survival in breast cancer. This suggests that CUTL1 plays a central role in coordinating a gene expression program associated with cell motility and tumor progression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002496","authors":["Patrick Michl","Antoine R Ramjaun","Olivier E Pardo","Patricia H Warne","Martin Wagner","Richard Poulsom","Corrado D'Arrigo","Kenneth Ryder","Andre Menke","Thomas Gress","Julian Downward"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ccr.2005.05.018","first_seen_on":"2013-12-09T14:16:55+00:00","issns":["1535-6108"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cancer Cell","last_mentioned_on":1435045173,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15950902?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ccr.2005.05.018"],"pmid":"15950902","pubdate":"2005-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"CUTL1 is a target of TGF\u03b2 signaling that enhances cancer cell motility and invasiveness","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cutl1-target-tgf%CE%B2-signaling-enhances-cancer-cell-motility-invasiveness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5268528,"mean":6.2009945015013,"rank":2429187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2707431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5268528,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136469,"mean":7.4213199577924,"rank":54780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":77551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136469,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1301,"mean":12.852184615385,"rank":877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1301,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":18.8812,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
