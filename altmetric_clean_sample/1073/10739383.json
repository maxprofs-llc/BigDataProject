Analytical methods for ultra-trace measurement of 135Cs and 137Cs are required for environmental geochemical and nuclear forensics studies. Here we report a highly sensitive method combining a desolvation sample introduction system (APEX-Q) with triple-quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (AEPX-ICP-MS\/MS) for the determination of 135Cs and 135Cs\/137Cs isotope ratio at femtogram levels. Using this system, we introduced only selected ions into the collision\/reaction cell to react with N2O, significantly reducing the isobaric interferences (135Ba+ and 137Ba+) and polyatomic interferences (95,97Mo40Ar+, 119Sn16O+, and 121Sb16O+). Compared to the instrument setup of ICP-MS\/MS, the APEX-ICP-MS\/MS enables a 10-fold sensitivity increase. In addition, an effective chemical separation scheme consisting of ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP) Cs-selective adsorption and two-stage ion-exchange chromatographic separation was developed to remove major matrix and interfering elements from environmental samples (10-40g). This separation method showed high decontamination factors (104-107) for major matrix elements (Al, Ca, K, Mg, Na and Si) and interfering elements (Ba, Mo, Sb and Sn). The high sensitivity of APEX-ICP-MS\/MS and the effective removal sample matrix allowed reliable analysis of 135Cs and 137Cs with extremely low detection limits (0.002 pg mL-1, corresponding to 0.006 Bq mL-1 137Cs). The accuracy and applicability of the APEX-ICP-MS\/MS method was validated by analysis of seven standard reference materials (soils, sediment and plants). For the first time, ultra-trace determination of 135Cs and 135Cs\/137Cs isotope ratio at global fallout source environmental samples was achieved with the ICP-MS technique. isotope ratio at femtogram levels.
