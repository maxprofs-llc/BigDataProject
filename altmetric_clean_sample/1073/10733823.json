In spite of the theoretical potential of CB1 NAMs, published in vivo studies have generally not been able to demonstrate the expected therapeutically-relevant CB1-mediated effects. Thus, a greater range of molecular tools are required to allow definitive elucidation of the effects of CB1 allosteric modulation. In this study, we show a novel series of indole sulfonamides. Compounds 5e and 6c (ABD1075) had potencies of 4 and 3nM respectively, and showed good oral exposure and CNS penetration, making them highly versatile tools for investigating the therapeutic potential of allosteric modulation of the cannabinoid system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Greig, Iain R","Baillie, Gemma L","Abdelrahman, Mostafa","Trembleau, Laurent","Ross, Ruth A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2016.08.018","endpage":"4407","first_seen_on":"2016-08-21T10:39:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-3405","0960894X"],"issue":"18","journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1471775972,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27542310?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27542310","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4403","subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Development of indole sulfonamides as cannabinoid receptor negative allosteric modulators","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-indole-sulfonamides-cannabinoid-receptor-negative-allosteric-modulators"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":7139976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253888,"mean":12.305362700729,"rank":214213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253888,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2109,"mean":2.5852514231499,"rank":1586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2109,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":2.383696969697,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
