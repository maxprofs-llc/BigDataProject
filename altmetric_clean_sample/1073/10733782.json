Bird-pollination is reported for 65 families of Angiosperms, including Bromeliaceae. One of the most diverse genera within bromeliads is Billbergia, which comprises species pollinated mainly by hummingbirds. Based on investigations on flowering phenology, flower morpho-anatomy, volume and concentration of floral nectar, pollinators, and breeding system, this paper explores the reproductive biology and pollinator specificity of widely distributed species (B. distachia) in a mesophytic semi-deciduous forest of southeastern Brazil. Billbergia distachia is exclusively pollinated by a single species of hermit hummingbird, Phaethornis eurynome, which search for floral nectar produced by a septal nectary, where the secretory tissue is located above the placenta. In the study area the species is self-incompatible. The combination of pollinator specificity, due to long corolla tubes that exclude the visitation of short-billed hummingbirds, complete self-incompatibility, and the non-territorial behavior of pollinators, is very important to reduce pollen loss and increase the gene flow within population. Studies on pollination biology and reproduction are essential to understand the evolutionary history of pollination systems of plants since, at least in Billbergia, variation in the pollinator spectrum has been recorded for different habitats along Brazilian forests. Furthermore, according to our data, the foraging of Phaethornis on flowers of B. distachia is independent of air temperature and humidity, while the main factor influencing hummingbird visitation is the daylight. Considering the current knowledge on the climatic parameters influencing hummingbird foraging, pollination and reproductive biology of Neotropical flora and environment of hermit hummingbird in tropical forests new insights on plant-pollinator interaction are provided.
