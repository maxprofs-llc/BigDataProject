Present study evaluated the effects of the biocide Cl2 to the green alga Closterium ehrenbergii (C. ehrenbergii). Growth rate, chlorophyll a levels, carotenoids, chlorophyll autofluorescence, and antioxidant enzymes were monitored up to 72-h after Cl2 exposure. C. ehrenbergii showed dose-dependent decrease in growth rate and cell division after exposure to Cl2. By using cell counts, the median effective concentration (EC50)-72-h was calculated to be 0.071mgL(-1). Cl2 significantly decreased the pigment levels and chlorophyll autofluorescence intensity, indicating that the photosystem was damaged in C. ehrenbergii. In addition, it increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells. This stressor significantly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione, and affected the physiology of the cells. These results indicate that Cl2 induces oxidative stress in the cellular metabolic process and leads to physiological and biochemical damages in the green algae. Cl2 discharged in industrial effluents and from water treatment plants may cause harmful effects to the C. ehrenbergii a common freshwater microalgae and other non-target organisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065db","authors":["Ramaraj Sathasivam","Vinitha Ebenezer","Ruoyu Guo","Jang-Seu Ki","Sathasivam, Ramaraj","Ebenezer, Vinitha","Guo, Ruoyu","Ki, Jang-Seu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ecoenv.2016.08.004","endpage":"508","first_seen_on":"2016-08-21T10:53:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01476513","1090-2414"],"journal":"Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety","last_mentioned_on":1472044105,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0147651316303074&_version=1&md5=7e116ed794c94508eed8e078145ee8bc","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27552343?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27552343","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"501","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Physiological and biochemical responses of the freshwater green algae Closterium ehrenbergii to the common disinfectant chlorine","type":"article","volume":"133","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physiological-biochemical-responses-freshwater-green-algae-closterium-ehrenbergii-common-disinfectan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":5981093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1996076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254044,"mean":12.306470109391,"rank":165630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":73384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254044,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1632,"mean":2.5418332311465,"rank":768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1632,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":1.3875789473684,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
