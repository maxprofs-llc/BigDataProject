Not much is known about pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies against these avian viruses in human population.\nTo determine the prevalence of cross-reactive anti-HA and anti-NA antibodies to avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 viruses in Thai population.\nArchival serum samples from 100 blood donors and 21 patients infected with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (pdmH1N1) virus were investigated by hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) and neuraminidase-inhibition (NAI) assays for anti-HA and anti-NA antibodies, respectively. The test antigens comprised 2 human viruses (pdmH1N1 and H3N2 viruses), and 6 reassortant viruses carrying HA and NA genes of avian H5N1 or H7N9 virus generated by reverse genetics.\nHAI antibody titers \u2265 10 were found in 58, 89, 0 and 15% of blood donors as tested against pdmH1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, respectively. On the other hand, NAI antibodies were detected in 98, 94, 73 and 53% of blood donors when reverse genetic-derived viruses harboring NA gene from pdmH1N1, H3N2, H5N1 or H7N9 virus were used as the test antigens. Moreover, 66.7% of pdmH1N1 patients who had > 4 fold increase in HAI antibody titers in paired sera developed > 4 fold increase in NAI antibody titers.\nAnti-NA antibody has broader reactivity than anti-HA antibody, therefore, it can be a supplement to anti-HA antibody in the prevention against novel influenza viruses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9113cf058f61000cc84","authors":["Jiang, Li","Changsom, Don","Lerdsamran, Hatairat","Masamae, Wanibtisam","Jongkaewwattana, Anan","Iamsirithaworn, Sopon","Oota, Sineenat","Louisirirotchanakul, Suda","Auewarakul, Prasert","Puthavathana, Pilaipan"],"doi":"10.12932\/ap0788","first_seen_on":"2016-08-21T14:56:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0125-877X","0125877X"],"journal":"Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology","last_mentioned_on":1472162236,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27543728?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27543728?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/thailand.digitaljournals.org\/index.php\/APJAI\/article\/download\/30689\/30387","pmid":"27543728","pubdate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Cross-reactive antibodies against H7N9 and H5N1 avian influenza viruses in Thais population","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crossreactive-antibodies-against-h7n9-h5n1-avian-influenza-viruses-thai-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":5984389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1997658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254089,"mean":12.306057373823,"rank":165574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":73485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254089,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":1.504641221374,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/H7N9Influenza\/statuses\/767371228700999680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10735135],"posted_on":"2016-08-21T14:42:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Novel Influenza News","url":"http:\/\/h7n9flunews.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3501363698\/67e86cb1c0a5dbe79300ad64694b8c9d_normal.jpeg","description":"Dave is a published writer and former magazine editor.
