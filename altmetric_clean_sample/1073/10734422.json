The research draws on theoretical and empirical research on the issue of meat eating and the psychological processes involved in it, and by analyzing in-depth interviews it reveals that these students exhibit partially different coping strategies than what studies on general population show, as a result of their awareness and their social circle. The results show that even though these people do not usually regard meat eating as wrong or undesirable in principle, they are well aware of the ethical and environmental issues related to it. In their attitudes and behavior the students are significantly influenced by their friends and fellow students amongst whom they perceive avoiding meat as a social norm. A generalization of the results suggests that the psychological dynamics of meat eating among environmentally informed and engaged people in general may be different than in general population. Further research into this group of people is proposed, most importantly from a socio-cultural point of view.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c3","authors":["\u0160edov\u00e1, Iveta","Slov\u00e1k, \u013dubo\u0161","Je\u017ekov\u00e1, Ivana"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.appet.2016.08.102","first_seen_on":"2016-08-21T12:29:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01956663","1095-8304"],"journal":"Appetite","last_mentioned_on":1471782537,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0195666316304196"],"pmid":"27554181","pubdate":"2016-08-25T22:07:41+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Coping with unpleasant knowledge: Meat eating among students of environmental studies ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coping-unpleasant-knowledge-meat-eating-among-students-environmental-studies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":7139965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253888,"mean":12.305322722313,"rank":214204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253888,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2365,"mean":16.713493231811,"rank":2198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2365,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":11.99464,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":11,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":8},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":5,"Psychology":8,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":2,"Arts and Humanities":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"LV":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MaritaHennessy\/statuses\/767337693403574273","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10734422],"posted_on":"2016-08-21T12:28:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Marita Hennessy","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Marita_Hennessy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/896056294246952972\/BEWpvdiE_normal.jpg","description":"@SPHeREprogramme PhD Scholar @hbcrg.
