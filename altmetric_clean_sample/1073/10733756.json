This study meticulously determines the staff radiation exposure in a PET\/CT facility by tracking the path of patient movement. The measurements of the instantaneous radiation exposure were performed using an electronic radiometer with a proportional counter that was equipped with the option of recording the results on line. The measurements allowed for visualisation of the staff's instantaneous exposure caused by a patient walking through the department after the administration of (18)F-FDG. An estimation of low doses associated with each working step and the exposure during a routine day in the department was possible. The measurements were completed by determining the average radiation level using highly sensitive thermoluminescent detectors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f61000670b","authors":["Tulik, P","Kowalska, M","Golnik, N","Budzy\u0144ska, A","Dziuk, M"],"doi":"10.1093\/rpd\/ncw228","first_seen_on":"2016-08-21T10:31:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1742-3406","0144-8420"],"journal":"Radiation Protection Dosimetry","last_mentioned_on":1471808412,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27542812?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27542812?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27542812","pubdate":"2016-08-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Health Professions","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"MEASUREMENTS OF THE IONISING RADIATION LEVEL AT A NUCLEAR MEDICINE FACILITY PERFORMING PET\/CT EXAMINATIONS","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measurements-ionising-radiation-level-nuclear-medicine-facility-performing-petct-examinations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":4149606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3894514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253888,"mean":12.305206725826,"rank":128610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":115128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253888,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":748,"mean":3.9386827309237,"rank":516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":748,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.1645833333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Physics and Astronomy":2,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/molecularimging\/statuses\/767307986758840320","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10733756],"posted_on":"2016-08-21T10:30:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Molecular Imaging","url":"http:\/\/www.medjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1081930767\/fdg_normal.PNG","description":"PET\/CT, MRI, CT, and other molecular imaging news and updates.
