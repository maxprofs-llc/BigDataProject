Because of its importance, there is a great interest in understanding its molecular properties and aggregation mechanism in water and mixed solvents. In this paper, we report a novel model of AXT for molecular dynamics simulation. The model is used to estimate different properties of the molecule in pure solutions and in water\/ethanol mixtures. The calculated diffusion coefficients of AXT in pure water and ethanol are $(3.22\\pm 0.01)\\times10^{-6}$ cm$^{2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(2.7\\pm0.4)\\times10^{-6}$ cm$^{2}$s$^{-1}$, respectively. Our simulations also show that the content of water plays a clear effect on the morphology of the AXT aggregation in water\/ethanol mixture. In up to 75\\% (v\/v) water concentration, loosely connected network of dimers and trimers, and two-dimensional array structures are observed. At higher water concentrations, AXT molecules form more compact three-dimensional structures that are preferentially solvated by the ethanol molecules. The ethanol preferential binding and the formation of a well connected hydrogen bonding network on these AXT clusters, suggest that such preferential solvation can play an important role in controlling the aggregate structure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Karki, Khadga Jung"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpcb.6b06055","first_seen_on":"2016-08-21T12:30:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5207","1520-6106"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1471782590,"links":["http:\/\/eprints.lincoln.ac.uk\/23775\/"],"pmid":"27536854","pubdate":"2016-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Molecular Properties of Astaxanthin in Water\/Ethanol Solutions from Computer Simulations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-properties-astaxanthin-waterethanol-solutions-computer-simulations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":6263682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1115214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253888,"mean":12.305321737623,"rank":180629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253888,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4011,"mean":1.7556369077307,"rank":1802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4011,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":2.3955696202532,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
