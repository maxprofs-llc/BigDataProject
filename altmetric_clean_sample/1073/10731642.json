The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) represents a crucial structure for the ability of endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling to modulate emotional behaviour, and receives dense projections from brainstem arousal system nuclei. We examined whether changes in arousal state would influence the ability of acute eCB manipulations within the BLA to modulate anxiety. Rats were tested in an elevated plus maze (EPM) under low or high arousal conditions. The low arousal group was extensively handled and habituated to the experimental room and tested under red light condition, the high arousal group was not handled or habituated and tested under high light condition. We examined amygdalar eCB anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) levels immediately after the EPM and the effects of intra-BLA administration of the AEA hydrolysis inhibitor URB597 or the 2-AG hydrolysis inhibitor KML29 on anxiety behaviour. The modulation of anxiety-like behaviour by eCBs in the BLA was strictly dependent on the environmental-associated emotional arousal. Pharmacologically-induced elevations of AEA or 2-AG in the BLA decreased anxiety under conditions of low arousal. Conversely, when the level of emotional arousal increased, local eCB manipulation was ineffective in the modulation of the arousal-induced anxiety response. These findings suggest that, depending on the arousal state, eCB system is differentially activated to regulate the anxiety response in the amygdala and help to understand the state-dependency of many interventions on anxiety.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a0","authors":["Morena, Maria","Leitl, Kira D","Vecchiarelli, Haley A","Gray, J Megan","Campolongo, Patrizia","Hill, Matthew N"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropharm.2016.08.020","endpage":"69","first_seen_on":"2016-08-21T05:44:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00283908","1873-7064"],"journal":"Neuropharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1474397786,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0028390816303550?np=y","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27553121?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27553121\/?i=2&from=endocannabinoid","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0028390816303550"],"pmid":"27553121","pubdate":"2016-08-25T11:13:48+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"59","subjects":["neurology","pharmacology"],"title":"Emotional arousal state influences the ability of amygdalar endocannabinoid signaling to modulate anxiety ","type":"article","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emotional-arousal-state-influences-ability-amygdalar-endocannabinoid-signaling-modulate-anxiety"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":747832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7660059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255343,"mean":12.347598295619,"rank":34077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":221182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255343,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2038,"mean":5.3951153657339,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2038,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":13.334745762712,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":7,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":11,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
