O-GlcNAcylation, either on its own or by its interplay with other post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and others, modulates the activities of signaling proteins, regulates most components of the transcription machinery, affects cell cycle progression and regulates the targeting\/turnover or functions of myriad other regulatory proteins, in response to nutrients. Acute increases in O-GlcNAcylation protect cells from stress-induced injury, while chronic deregulation of O-GlcNAc cycling contributes to the etiology of major human diseases of aging, such as diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Recent advances in tools to study O-GlcNAcylation at the individual site level and specific inhibitors of O-GlcNAc cycling have allowed more rapid progress toward elucidating the specific functions of O-GlcNAcylation in essential cellular processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cae8","authors":["Hart, Gerald W."],"doi":"10.3389\/fendo.2014.00183","first_seen_on":"2014-10-27T23:22:11+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1664-2392"],"journal":"Frontiers in endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1415838804,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fendo.2014.00183\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25386167"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fendo.2014.00183\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4209869","pmid":"25386167","pubdate":"2014-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Three Decades of Research on O-GlcNAcylation \u2013 A Major Nutrient Sensor That Regulates Signaling, Transcription and Cellular Metabolism","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/three-decades-research-oglcnacylation-major-nutrient-sensor-regulates-signaling-transcription-cellul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":2122230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2246937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124871,"mean":8.517215023625,"rank":56472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":62986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124871,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":743,"mean":2.0725956873315,"rank":231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":743,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":1.2653225806452,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
