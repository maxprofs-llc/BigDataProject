For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation; this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of operons in prokaryotic systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"52d545303cf058dd068b4567","authors":["Lui J","Castelli LM","Pizzinga M","Simpson CE","Hoyle NP","Bailey KL","Campbell SG","Ashe MP","Jennifer Lui","Lydia\u00a0M.
