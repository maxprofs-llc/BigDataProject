However, innate and acquired resistance is a major obstacle of the efficacy. Autophagy is a self-digesting process in cells, which is considered to be associated with anti-cancer drug resistance. The activation of EGFR can regulate autophagy through multiple signal pathways. EGFR inhibitors can induce autophagy, but the specific function of the induction of autophagy by EGFR inhibitors remains biphasic. On the one hand, autophagy induced by EGFR inhibitors acts as a cytoprotective response in cancer cells, and autophagy inhibitors can enhance the cytotoxic effects of EGFR inhibitors. On the other hand, a high level of autophagy after treatment of EGFR inhibitors can also result in autophagic cell death lacking features of apoptosis, and the combination of EGFR inhibitors with an autophagy inducer might be beneficial. Thus, autophagy regulation represents a promising approach for improving the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in the treatment of cancer patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Jie Cui","Yun-Feng Hu","Xie-Min Feng","Tao Tian","Ya-Huan Guo","Jun-Wei Ma","Ke-Jun Nan","Hong-Yi Zhang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13277-014-2660-z","first_seen_on":"2014-10-28T11:26:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1423-0380"],"journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1414495568,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s13277-014-2660-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs13277-014-2660-z.pdf","pmid":"25293518","pubdate":"2014-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"EGFR inhibitors and autophagy in cancer treatment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/egfr-inhibitors-autophagy-cancer-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5428610,"mean":6.3209808545807,"rank":2694936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2570344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5428610,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152122,"mean":8.6933362652101,"rank":71023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":74791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152122,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1597,"mean":0.9445977443609,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1597,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":0.76837209302326,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"EGFR inhibitors and autophagy in cancer treatment - Online First - Springer","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=724421790979621&id=283140958441042","license":"public","citation_ids":[2817717],"posted_on":"2014-10-28T11:26:06+00:00","summary":"EGFR inhibitors and autophagy in cancer treatment http:\/\/ow.ly\/Ds4W4","author":{"name":"VIVA Bioscience","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/283140958441042","facebook_wall_name":"VIVA Bioscience","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/283140958441042\/picture","id_on_source":"283140958441042"}}],"googleplus":[{"title":"EGFR inhibitors and autophagy in cancer treatment http:\/\/ow.ly\/Ds4W4","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/106121161224518917945\/posts\/cTwMjBnqpHN","license":"public","citation_ids":[2817717],"posted_on":"2014-10-28T11:26:08+00:00","summary":"EGFR inhibitors and autophagy in cancer treatment http:\/\/ow.ly\/Ds4W4 EGFR inhibitors and autophagy in cancer treatment http:\/\/ow.ly\/Ds4W4\ufeff EGFR inhibitors and autophagy in cancer treatment - Online First - Springer Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) i","author":{"name":"VIVA Bioscience","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/106121161224518917945","image":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-q1Smh9d8d0g\/AAAAAAAAAAM\/AAAAAAAAAAA\/3YaY0XeTIPc\/photo.jpg?sz=50","id_on_source":"106121161224518917945"}}]}}
