TNF-Receptor Associated Factor-2 (TRAF2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, coordinates cytoprotective signaling downstream of both TNF receptors, via unclear mechanisms. Noting that TRAF2 is recruited to mitochondria, and that autophagic removal of ubiquitin-tagged damaged mitochondria is cytoprotective, we tested the hypothesis that TRAF2 mediates mitochondrial autophagy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ecf","authors":["Kai-Chun Yang","Xiucui Ma","Haiyan Liu","John Murphy","Philip M Barger","Douglas L Mann","Abhinav Diwan"],"doi":"10.1161\/circheartfailure.114.001635","first_seen_on":"2014-10-24T15:25:30+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi","phs"],"issns":["1941-3297"],"journal":"Circulation: Heart Failure","last_mentioned_on":1414164316,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25339503?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25339503","pubdate":"2014-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"TNF-Receptor Associated Factor-2 Mediates Mitochondrial Autophagy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptorassociated-factor-2-mediates-mitochondrial-autophagy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4412571,"mean":4.825676177232,"rank":3425551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":130294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4412571,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121979,"mean":7.540870501238,"rank":91807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121979,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":422,"mean":7.0599287410926,"rank":322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":422,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":3.6269230769231,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/status\/525669361277620224","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2811473],"posted_on":"2014-10-24T15:25:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":416},"tweet_id":"525669361277620224"}]}}
