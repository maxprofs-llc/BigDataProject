The present study investigated the expression status of tight junction associated Claudin 1 (CLDN1), Claudin 5 (CLDN5) and Adheren junction associated \u03b2-catenin genes in the light of their critical role in the progression of both low- and high-grade human gliomas. Using quantitative PCR and Western blot methods the mRNA and protein status of CLDN1, CLDN5 and \u03b2-catenin genes were studied in a total of 25 human gliomas of World Health Organization (WHO) grades I-IV, non-cancerous control brain tissues and their corresponding model cell lines (C6, U373, U118, T98 and U87MG). Quantitative analysis of the transcript and protein expression data showed that CLDN1 and CLDN5 were significantly down regulated (p=<0.001) in tumors of all four grades and model cell lines. This decrease in expression pattern was in accordance with the increasing grade of the tumor. A 4-fold stronger reduction of CLDN1 when compared to CLDN5 was evident in high-grade tumors. Interestingly, \u03b2-catenin was up regulated in all tumor types we studied (p=<0.005). Our findings, suggest that down regulated CLDN1 and CLDN5 genes have potential relevance in relation to the progression of glioblastoma multiforme. Hence, their therapeutic targeting may provide both insight and leads to control the cellular proliferation and subsequent invasiveness among affected individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002584","authors":["H K Karnati","M Panigrahi","N A Shaik","N H Greig","S Ar Bagadi","N Kapalavayi"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-28T13:04:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1996-3181"],"journal":"CNS & Neurological Disorders - Drug Targets","last_mentioned_on":1414501402,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25345514?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25345514","pubdate":"2014-10-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Down Regulated Expression of Claudin-1 and Claudin-5 and Up Regulation of \u03b2-catenin Protein is Associated with Human Glioma Progression.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/down-regulated-expression-claudin1-claudin5-up-regulation-%CE%B2catenin-association-human-glioma-progress"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2296271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1616867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124959,"mean":8.4100857087984,"rank":62308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":47495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124959,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318,"mean":2.4747823343849,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.7092105263158,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
