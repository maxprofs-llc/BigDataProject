Karyotypes and other chromosomal characteristics were revealed by CDD banding and mapped onto the phylogenetic hypothesis based on molecular analyses of four genes, namely cyt b, 16S rRNA, S7 and RAG1. The diploid numbers of chromosomes ranged from 44 to 50, karyotypes were composed predominantly of monoarmed chromosomes and one to three pairs of CMA3 signal were observed. The results showed evolutionary reduction in this monophyletic clade and the cytogenetic mechanisms (fissions\/fusions) were hypothesized and discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003ac4","authors":["Lucie Hoda\u0148ov\u00e1","Luk\u00e1\u0161 Kalous","Zuzana Musilov\u00e1"],"doi":"10.3897\/compcytogen.v8i3.7279","first_seen_on":"2014-10-29T16:02:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1993-0771","1993-078X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Comparative Cytogenetics","last_mentioned_on":1414598500,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25349669?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/CompCytogen.v8i3.7279"],"pmid":"25349669","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Comparative cytogenetics of Neotropical cichlid fishes (Nannacara, Ivanacara and Cleithracara) indicates evolutionary reduction of diploid chromosome\u00a0numbers","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-cytogenetics-neotropical-cichlid-fishes-nannacara-ivanacara-cleithracara-indicates-evolu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1965608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2522606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124860,"mean":8.4219357355099,"rank":50065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":74111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124860,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":2.4865079365079,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":11,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1},"mendeley":{"CA":1,"CZ":1,"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cichlid_papers\/status\/527406377870692353","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2819932],"posted_on":"2014-10-29T10:27:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Cichlid Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/512589381949857793\/g0Sl-a4e_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot of cichlid PubMed papers (inspired by @fly_papers).
