The aim of this study was to determine the effects of P. guajava ethyl acetate extract (PGEA) on atopic dermatitis and to investigate the possible mechanisms by which PGEA inhibits cytokine-induced Th2 chemokine expression in HaCaT human keratinocyte cells. We found that PGEA suppressed the IFN-\u03b3\/TNF-\u03b1-co-induced production of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) protein and mRNA in HaCaT cells. Additionally, PGEA inhibited the TNF-\u03b1\/IFN-\u03b3-co-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and STAT1 and increased the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein and mRNA. HO-1 inhibitor enhanced the suppressive effects of PGEA on TNF-\u03b1\/IFN-\u03b3-co-induced TARC production and gene expression. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PGEA inhibits chemokine expression in keratinocytes by inducing HO-1 expression and it suggests a possible therapeutic application in atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory skin diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f1","authors":["Han EH","Hwang YP","Choi JH","Yang JH","Seo JK","Chung YC","Jeong HG"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.etap.2011.04.004","first_seen_on":"2014-10-28T10:47:20+00:00","issns":["1382-6689"],"issue":"2","journal":"Environmental Toxicology & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1414493458,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/21843792\/?i=2&from=Psidium%20guajava.%20AND%20allergy"],"pmid":"21843792","pubdate":"2011-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","pharmacology"],"title":"Psidium guajava extract inhibits thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC\/CCL17) production in human keratinocytes by inducing heme oxygenase-1 and blocking NF-\u03baB and STAT1 activation.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psidium-guajava-extract-inhibits-thymus-activationregulated-chemokine-tarcccl17-production-human-ker"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2087440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2381762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124960,"mean":8.4091261133654,"rank":54185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":69716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124960,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":3.734025862069,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.6238095238095,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
