But in 1964, Heilbronner predicted on purely theoretical grounds that cyclic molecules with the topology of a M\u00f6bius band--a ring constructed by joining the ends of a rectangular strip after having given one end half a twist--should be aromatic if they contain 4n, rather than 4n + 2, pi electrons. The prediction stimulated attempts to synthesize M\u00f6bius aromatic hydrocarbons, but twisted cyclic molecules are destabilized by large ring strains, with the twist also suppressing overlap of the p orbitals involved in electron delocalization and stabilization. In larger cyclic molecules, ring strain is less pronounced but the structures are very flexible and flip back to the less-strained H\u00fcckel topology. Although transition-state species, an unstable intermediate and a non-conjugated cyclic molecule, all with a M\u00f6bius topology, have been documented, a stable aromatic M\u00f6bius system has not yet been realized. Here we report that combining a 'normal' aromatic structure (with p orbitals orthogonal to the ring plane) and a 'belt-like' aromatic structure (with p orbitals within the ring plane) yields a M\u00f6bius compound stabilized by its extended pi system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["D.
