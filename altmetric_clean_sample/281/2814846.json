Eight healthy volunteers participated in this observational study.Objective. Quantify three dimensional motions of the lumbar vertebrae during running via direct in vivo measurement and compare these motions to walking data from the same technique and running data from a skin mounted technique.Summary of Background Data. Lumbar spine motions in running are only reported in one series of articles using a skin mounted technique subject to overestimation and only instrumented a single vertebra.Methods. Reflective marker triads were attached to Kirschner wires inserted into the spinous processes of L1- S1. Anatomic registration between each vertebra and attached triad was achieved using spinal CT scans. Skin mounted trunk markers were used to assess thoracic motions. Subjects ran several times in a calibrated volume at self-selected speed while three-dimensional motion data were collected.Results. Lumbar spine flexion and pelvic rotation patterns in running were reversed compared to walking. Increased lumbar spine motions during running occurred at the most inferior segments. Thoracic spine, lumbar spine and pelvis exhibited significantly greater range of sagittal plane motion with running. The pelvis had significantly greater range of frontal plane motion, and the thoracic spine had significantly greater range of transverse plane motion with running. Skin mounted studies reported as much as four times the motion range determined by the indwelling bone pin techniques, indicating that the skin motion relative to the underlying bone during running was greater than the motion of the underlying vertebrae.Conclusions. The lumbar spine acts as a distinct functional segment in the spine during running, chiefly contributing lateral flexion to balance the relative motions between the trunk and pelvis. The lumbar spine is also shown to oppose thoracic spine flexion. While the lumbar spine chiefly contributes frontal plane motion, the thoracic spine contributes the majority of the transverse plane motion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["MacWilliams BA","Rozumalski A","Swanson AN","Wervey R","Dykes DC","Novacheck TF","Schwartz MH"],"doi":"10.1097\/brs.0000000000000646","first_seen_on":"2014-10-28T03:36:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0362-2436"],"issue":"","journal":"Spine","last_mentioned_on":1456500487,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25341976","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Three_Dimensional_Lumbar_Spine_Vertebral_Motion.96987.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Abstract\/2014\/12150\/Three_Dimensional_Lumbar_Spine_Vertebral_Motion.5.aspx"],"pmid":"25341976","pubdate":"2014-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Three-Dimensional Lumbar Spine Vertebral Motion During Running Using Indwelling Bone Pins","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threedimensional-lumbar-spine-vertebral-motion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289383,"mean":6.3680766857843,"rank":1370515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5910673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289383,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197997,"mean":7.7291936402758,"rank":41212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":156502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197997,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4368,"mean":5.6126988779482,"rank":950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4368,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128,"mean":8.5275905511811,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"SG":1,"FR":1,"ES":1,"GB":2},"mendeley":{"AT":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Three Dimensional Lumbar Spine Vertebral Motion During Running Util... -
