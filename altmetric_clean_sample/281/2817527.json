Marine sponges have so far provided more than 1000 new bioactive molecules. Ethyl acetate extract of the marine sponge Dendrilla nigra on bioactivity-guided screening yielded three new compounds denigrins A-C, with potent antitubercular activity. Spectral and chemical analyses confirmed that these three compounds belong to the 3,4-diaryl pyrrole alkaloid category. The presence of monohydroxy substitution on benzene rings is not very common in lamellarin and related 3,4-diaryl pyrrole alkaloids isolated from marine invertebrates. Among these, denigrin C showed highest potency (minimum inhibitory concentration 4 \u03bcg\/mL) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f6100010b5","authors":["Murali Krishna Kumar M","Devilal Naik J","Satyavathi K","Ramana H","Raghuveer Varma P","Purna Nagasree K","Smitha D","Venkata Rao D"],"doi":"10.1080\/14786419.2014.891112","first_seen_on":"2014-10-28T10:44:57+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Natural Product Research","last_mentioned_on":1414513924,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24650250?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24650250","pubdate":"2014-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Denigrins A-C: new antitubercular 3,4-diarylpyrrole alkaloids from Dendrilla nigra.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/denigrins-ac-new-antitubercular-34diarylpyrrole-alkaloids-dendrilla-nigra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508925,"mean":5.2085143105191,"rank":1721356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2757095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508925,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124980,"mean":8.6159661543142,"rank":42273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":81366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124980,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":457,"mean":2.0317938596491,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":457,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":0.6234358974359,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sponge_papers\/status\/527037226710872064","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2817527],"posted_on":"2014-10-28T10:00:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Sponge Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"Recent papers on sponges (Phylum Porifera).","id_on_source":"sponge_papers","tweeter_id":"2801421163","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":63},"tweet_id":"527037226710872064"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/status\/527098404795473920","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2817527],"posted_on":"2014-10-28T14:03:47+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
