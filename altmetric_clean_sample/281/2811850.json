Estrogens play a key role in sexual differentiation and in activation of sexual behavior in Japanese quail. The distribution of ERalpha in the brain of male and female adult quail has previously been studied using immunohistochemistry, whereas in situ hybridization has been employed to study the distribution of ERbeta mRNA in males only. In this article, we used in situ hybridization to study the distribution of mRNAs for both ERalpha and ERbeta in brain areas controlling sexual behavior of Japanese quail. Our results show that both ERalpha mRNA and ERbeta mRNA are localized in areas important for sexual behavior, such as the preoptic area and associated limbic areas, in both males and females. Moreover, we found differences in distribution of mRNA for the two receptors in these areas. The results of this article support previously reported data and provide novel data on localization of ER mRNAs in adult quail brain of both sexes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d91","authors":["Halldin, Krister","Axelsson, Jeanette","Holmgren, Claes","Brunstr\u00f6m, Bj\u00f6rn"],"doi":"10.1002\/neu.20199","endpage":"154","first_seen_on":"2014-10-24T17:21:12+00:00","issns":["1097-4695","0022-3034"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1414171294,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/neu.20199\/abstract#.VEqKlIiu2N8.facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/neu.20199\/pdf","pmid":"16215996","pubdate":"2005-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","startpage":"148","subjects":["biology","neurology"],"title":"Localization of estrogen receptor\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2mRNA in brain areas controlling sexual behavior in Japanese quail","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/localization-estrogen-receptoralpha-betamrna-brain-areas-controlling-sexual-behavior-japanese-quail"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6705730,"mean":6.1623148650933,"rank":5728596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6705730,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195279,"mean":7.4867017790025,"rank":155038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195279,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":3.5721739130435,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Localization of estrogen receptor-\u03b1 and -\u03b2mRNA in brain areas controlling sexual behavior in...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100006307243630\/posts\/1579395915613968","license":"public","citation_ids":[2811850],"posted_on":"2014-10-24T17:21:34+00:00","summary":"onlinelibrary.wiley.com","author":{"name":"\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0629 \u062f\u0631\u0627\u0633\u0627\u062a","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100006307243630","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/100006307243630\/picture","id_on_source":"100006307243630"}},{"title":"Localization of estrogen receptor-\u03b1 and -\u03b2mRNA in brain areas controlling sexual behavior in...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100006307243630\/posts\/1579395652280661","license":"public","citation_ids":[2811850],"posted_on":"2014-10-24T17:20:03+00:00","summary":"onlinelibrary.wiley.com","author":{"name":"\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0629 \u062f\u0631\u0627\u0633\u0627\u062a","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100006307243630","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/100006307243630\/picture","id_on_source":"100006307243630"}}]}}
