Close mother-infant body contact immediately after birth positively enhances exclusive breastfeeding during the hospital stay, with a dose-response relationship. Skin-to-skin contact may ease the infant's transition to extra-uterine life and helps regulate the infant's body temperature and nursing behavior. However, reports of sudden unexpected postnatal collapse (SUPC) soon after birth, in healthy term neonates, in association with SSC, have raised concerns about the safety of this practice. Based on available evidence, we developed a surveillance protocol in the delivery room and postnatal ward of the Institute for Maternal and Child Health of Trieste (Italy). The aim of our protocol is (a) to promote safe mother and infant bonding and (b) to establish successful breastfeeding, without increasing the risk of SUPC. As there is no known effective intervention to prevent SUPC, our protocol has been conceived as a potential best practice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5a13cf058f61000528b","authors":["Riccardo Davanzo","Angela De Cunto","Giulia Paviotti","Laura Travan","Stefania Inglese","Pierpaolo Brovedani","Anna Crocetta","Chiara Calligaris","Elisa Corubolo","Valentina Dussich","Giuseppa Verardi","Enrica Causin","Jaquelyn Kennedy","Francesca Marrazzo","Tamara Strajn","Cecilia Sanesi","Sergio Demarini"],"doi":"10.1177\/0890334414554927","endpage":"52","first_seen_on":"2014-10-24T16:57:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1552-5732","0890-3344"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Human Lactation","last_mentioned_on":1414339904,"links":["http:\/\/jhl.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2014\/10\/19\/0890334414554927?papetoc=","http:\/\/jhl.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2014\/10\/19\/0890334414554927?papetoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jhl.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2014\/10\/19\/0890334414554927.full.pdf","pmid":"25339551","pubdate":"2014-10-21T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"47","subjects":["nursing","obstetrics"],"title":"Making the First Days of Life Safer Preventing Sudden Unexpected Postnatal Collapse while Promoting Breastfeeding","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/making-first-days-life-safer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2079818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2872911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143213,"mean":8.5425972544202,"rank":52757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":87578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143213,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":498,"mean":5.9693400402414,"rank":285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":498,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":8.574,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SAGEHealthInfo\/status\/526404218710929408","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2811765],"posted_on":"2014-10-26T16:05:20+00:00","author":{"name":"SAGE Health Research","url":"http:\/\/www.sagepublications.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/718100077592510464\/zQZ3LXeN_normal.jpg","description":"Follow us for the latest research on SAGE Publishing public health and health services, as well as general news items of interest.","id_on_source":"SAGEHealthInfo","tweeter_id":"338930010","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3512},"tweet_id":"526404218710929408"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CenterQP\/status\/526404800674795520","license":"datasift","rt":["SAGEHealthInfo"],"citation_ids":[2811765],"posted_on":"2014-10-26T16:07:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Qualitative Psycho","url":"http:\/\/www.qualitativepsychology.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507135290381574145\/5gPHfnqE_normal.jpeg","description":"Center of Qualitative Psychology.
