The main pharmacological mechanism is based on the fact that BP induces the release as well as inhibits the reuptake of neurotransmitters such as a dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). Additional mechanisms of action have been also determined. For example, BP is a noncompetitive antagonist (NCA) of several nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Based on this evidence, the dual antidepressant and anti-nicotinic activity of BP is currently considered to be mediated by its stimulatory action on the DA and NE systems as well as its inhibitory action on AChRs. Considering the results obtained in the archetypical mouse muscle AChR, a sequential mechanism can be hypothesized to explain the inhibitory action of BP on neuronal AChRs: (1) BP first binds to AChRs in the resting state, decreasing the probability of ion channel opening, (2) the remnant fraction of open ion channels is subsequently decreased by accelerating the desensitization process, and (3), BP interacts with a binding domain located between the serine (position 6') and valine (position 13') rings that is shared with the NCA phencyclidine and other tricyclic antidepressants. This new evidence paves the way for further investigations using AChRs as targets for the action of safer antidepressants and novel anti-addictive compounds.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b26","authors":["Arias HR"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biocel.2009.05.015","first_seen_on":"2014-10-24T13:03:59+00:00","issns":["13572725"],"issue":"11","journal":"International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1320090114,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.biocel.2009.05.015","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19497387"],"pmid":"19497387","pubdate":"2009-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Is the inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by bupropion involved in its clinical actions?","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-nicotinic-acetylcholine-receptors-bupropion-involved-clinical-actions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8163518,"mean":6.8970466082141,"rank":2060080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4971774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8163518,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202022,"mean":7.8861687448337,"rank":55346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":142271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202022,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1123,"mean":3.807614973262,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1123,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.1155172413793,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
