Heart rate variability (HRV) has emerged as an objective measure of individual differences in the capacity for inhibitory control. In the present study, we investigated how individual differences in HRV at rest are associated with the emotional effects of the outcome of a choice on subsequent decision making using a decision-making task in which emotional pictures appeared as decision outcomes. We used a reinforcement learning model to characterize the observed behaviors according to several parameters, namely, the learning rate and the motivational value of positive and negative pictures. Consequently, we found that individuals with a lower resting HRV exhibited a greater negative motivational value in response to negative pictures, suggesting that these individuals tend to avoid negative pictures compared with individuals with a higher resting HRV.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023da","doi":"10.1016\/j.biopsycho.2014.10.007","first_seen_on":"2014-10-28T09:54:29+00:00","issns":["03010511"],"journal":"Biological Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1414369805,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0301051114002221"],"pmid":"25457639","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"title":"Individual differences in heart rate variability are associated with the avoidance of negative emotional events ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/individual-differences-heart-rate-variability-associated-avoidance-negative-emotional-events"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":1837766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3189583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143893,"mean":8.6904478914743,"rank":44129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":99431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143893,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":672,"mean":6.0645931445604,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":672,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":4.9916666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
