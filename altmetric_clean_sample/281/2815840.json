Arterial inflow of the extremity is routinely evaluated with several modalities; however, venous screening is rarely performed. Patients with cancer are at elevated risk of occult deep venous thrombosis (DVT). An asymptomatic thrombus encountered during free fibula reconstruction is a serious concern. Although such cases have been reported, we suspect the incidence of DVT during fibula free flap harvest is underappreciated. This monograph uses a case example to review risk factors for occult DVT, present a strategy for preoperative assessment, and provide a reconstructive algorithm to for mandibular reconstruction in such instances.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a2c","authors":["Patel, Sameer A.","Abdollahi, Hamid","Ridge, John A.","Chang, Eric I.","Lango, Miriam N.","Topham, Neal S."],"doi":"10.1097\/sap.0000000000000355","first_seen_on":"2014-10-28T06:39:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0148-7043"],"issue":"4","journal":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1460255220,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Asymptomatic_Deep_Peroneal_Vein_Thrombosis_During.98357.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Abstract\/2016\/04000\/Asymptomatic_Deep_Peroneal_Vein_Thrombosis_During.23.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Asymptomatic_Deep_Peroneal_Vein_Thrombosis_During.98357.pdf","pmid":"25275472","pubdate":"2014-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Asymptomatic Deep Peroneal Vein Thrombosis During Free Fibula Flap Harvest: A Review of the Literature, Strategies for Preoperative Assessment, and an Algorithm for Reconstruction.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Fulltext\/2016\/04000\/Asymptomatic_Deep_Peroneal_Vein_Thrombosis_During.23.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/asymptomatic-deep-peroneal-vein-thrombosis-during-free-fibula-flap-harvest-review-literature-strateg"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7529066,"mean":6.5069445313556,"rank":6521842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7529066,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199191,"mean":7.7933101762139,"rank":159951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199191,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2355,"mean":1.3168717077315,"rank":927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2355,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":0.96565333333333,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnnalsofPlSrgy\/status\/526661167360401408","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2815840],"posted_on":"2014-10-27T09:06:21+00:00","author":{"name":"APSOnlineJrl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611398882\/APS_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief: William C.
