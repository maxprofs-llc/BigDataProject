In addition, the acidic enviroment in the tissue of stroke victims necessitates drug release upon pH stimuli. Here we report the encapsulation of single neural stem cells (NSCs) using a layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly technique with polyelectrolytes gelatin and alginate. Analysis of the NSCs showed that the LbL encapsulation would not affect the viability, proliferation and differentiation of the cells. When insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) was loaded on the coating material alginate, its release from alginate into the medium presented in a time-dependent and pH-dependent way. IGF-1 significantly enhanced the proliferation of the encapsulated NSCs, demonstrating a drug-carrier function of the LbL single-cell nanocoating. It provided a potential treatment strategy for nervous system disorders such as stroke.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Wenyan Li","Teng Guan","Xiaosha Zhang","Ziyuan Wang","Meng Wang","Wen Zhong","Hua Feng","Malcolm M Q Xing","Jiming Kong"],"doi":"10.1021\/am504456t","first_seen_on":"2014-10-28T11:12:51+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1944-8252"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1414494604,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25347385?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25347385","pubdate":"2014-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
