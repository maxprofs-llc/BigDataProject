The photochemistry of cyclohexanone is studied here using on-the-fly molecular dynamics simulations on a semi-empirical MRCI potential energy surface to predict the distribution of photoproducts and timescales for their formation. Rich photochemistry is predicted following the photoexcitation of cyclohexanone to the first singlet excited state. The main findings include: (1) Reaction channels found experimentally are confirmed by theoretical simulations, and a new reaction channel is predicted. (2) The majority (87 %) of the reactive trajectories start with the ring-opening via C-C\u03b1 cleavage, supporting observations of previous studies. (3) Mechanistic details, timescales and yields are predicted for all reaction channels. These benchmark results shed light on the photochemistry of isolated carbonyl compounds in the atmosphere and can be extended in the future to photochemistry of more complex atmospherically-relevant carbonyl compounds in both gaseous and condensed-phase environments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Dorit Shemesh"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpca.6b06184","first_seen_on":"2016-08-22T08:26:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5215","1089-5639"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","last_mentioned_on":1471861182,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpca.6b06184"],"pmid":"27525541","pubdate":"2016-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
