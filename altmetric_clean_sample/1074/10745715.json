The technical approach is based on electric field-assisted migration of calcium ions and phosphate ions into a hydrogel composed of carboxymethylated gelatin. The electric field as well as the carboxymethylation using glucuronic acid (GlcA) significantly accelerates the mineralization process, which makes the process feasible for lab scale production of ormoHAP spheres and probably beyond. A further process was developed for gentle separation of the ormoHAP spheres from the gelatin gel without compromising the morphology of the mineral. The term ormoHAP was chosen since morphological analyses using electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) and element analysis (EDX, FT-IR, XRD) confirmed that carboxymethylated gelatin molecules use to act as organic templates for the formation of nanocrystalline HAP. The hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystals self-organize to form hollow spheres with diameters ranging from 100-500 nm. The combination of the biocompatible chemical composition and the unique structure of the nanocomposites is considered to be a useful basis for future applications in functionalized degradable biomaterials.\nA novel bioinspired mineralization process was developed based on electric field-assisted migration of calcium and phosphate ions into biochemically carboxymethylated gelatin acting as organic template. Advantages over conventional hydroxyapatite include particle size distribution and homogeneity as well as achievable mechanical properties of relevant composites. Moreover, specifically developed calcium ion or phosphate ion release during degradation can be useful to adjust the fate of bone cells in order to manipulate remodeling processes. The hollow structure of the spheres can be useful for embedding drugs in the core, encapsulated by the highly mineralized outer shell. In this way, controlled drug release could be achieved, which enables advanced strategies for threating bone-related diseases, e.g. osteoporosis and multiple myeloma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000682a","authors":["Heinemann, C","Heinemann, S","Kruppke, B","Worch, H","Thomas, J","Wiesmann, H P","Hanke, T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.actbio.2016.08.024","endpage":"143","first_seen_on":"2016-08-22T10:10:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-7568","17427061"],"journal":"Acta Biomaterialia","last_mentioned_on":1476603937,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27544814?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.actbio.2016.08.024"],"pmid":"27544814","pubdate":"2016-08-22T22:00:24+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"135","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Electric field-assisted formation of organically modified hydroxyapatite (ormoHAP) spheres in carboxymethylated gelatin gels.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electric-fieldassisted-formation-organically-modified-hydroxyapatite-ormohap-spheres-carboxymethylat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":9.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":773190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6767329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245429,"mean":12.115863202242,"rank":39014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":205685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245429,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1172,"mean":5.0028146883006,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1172,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":7.8954545454545,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
