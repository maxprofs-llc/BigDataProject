Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a leukocyte-derived enzyme that participates in the innate immunity, probably is involved in many stages of atherothrombosis. According to the recent studies, MPO is related with unfavorable outcome in patients with chest pain and acute coronary syndromes. Its role in prediction of outcomes after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains unclear. The aim of the study was to assess if elevated MPO level is a predictor of long-term adverse cardiac events in patients with STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI).\nWe evaluated data of 127 patients with STEMI. Plasma levels of MPO collected on admission and the 3rd-4th day of hospitalization were measured by ELISA method. C-reactive protein (CRP) and N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were also determined. All patients were followed-up prospectively for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as unscheduled coronary revascularization procedure, stroke, reinfarction or all-cause death.\nAfter 14months of follow-up 20% of patients developed MACE. Elevated MPO levels collected on the 3rd-4th day of STEMI were the predictor of death, reinfarction, the need for coronary revascularization and all adverse events taken together. In multivariate analysis, MPO and CRP levels assessed on the 3rd-4th day of hospitalization revealed to be significant predictors of MACE. MPO demonstrated to be significantly better predictor of MACE than NT-proBNP level.\nMyeloperoxidase is a prognostic marker in patients with STEMI treated with pPCI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b29","authors":["Kacprzak, Michal","Zielinska, Marzenna"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijcard.2016.07.258","endpage":"457","first_seen_on":"2016-08-22T10:44:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1874-1754","01675273"],"journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1471862628,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27544604?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27544604","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"452","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Prognostic value of myeloperoxidase concentration in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention","type":"article","volume":"223","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-value-myeloperoxidase-concentration-patients-stsegment-elevation-myocardial-infarction-tr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":6267903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1116326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253846,"mean":12.332040828064,"rank":180589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253846,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3776,"mean":3.1969271523179,"rank":2005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3776,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285,"mean":3.8555281690141,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/767673619249889280","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10746120],"posted_on":"2016-08-22T10:43:48+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
