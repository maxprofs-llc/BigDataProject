The implementation of home monitoring programmes for this group of infants has improved this initial inter-stage survival; however, little is known about parents' experiences of going home, their preparedness for discharge, and parents' recognition of deterioration in their fragile infant.\nThis study was conducted in 2011-2013; eight sets of parents were consulted in the research planning stage in September, 2011, and 22 parents with children aged 0-2 years responded to an online survey during November, 2012-March, 2013. Description of categorical data and deductive thematic analysis of the open-ended questions were undertaken.\nNot all parents were taught signs of deterioration or given written information specific to their baby. The following three themes emerged from the qualitative data: mixed emotions about going home, knowledge and preparedness, and support systems.\nParents are not adequately prepared for discharge and are not well equipped to recognise deterioration in their child. There is a role for greater parental education through development of an early warning tool to address the gap in parents' understanding of signs of deterioration, enabling appropriate contact and earlier management by clinicians.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024aa","authors":["Kerry L.
