Using Photovoice as a data collection approach, this community-engaged research study partnered with a weight management program to understand participants' perspectives on access to physical activity and nutritious food. Twelve adolescent-parent dyads participated. Barriers, facilitators, and opportunities for change were identified and categorized through adolescent photographs, interviews, and participant focus groups, according to the social ecological model. A community-engaged research approach can identify areas to increase health promotion and prevention efforts regarding physical activity and nutrition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058dd","authors":["Nichols, Michelle","Nemeth, Lynne S.","Magwood, Gayenell","Odulana, Adebowale","Newman, Susan"],"doi":"10.1097\/fch.0000000000000118","endpage":"309","first_seen_on":"2016-08-22T08:05:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1550-5057","0160-6379"],"issue":"4","journal":"Family & Community Health","last_mentioned_on":1472766919,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/familyandcommunityhealth\/Abstract\/2016\/10000\/Exploring_the_Contextual_Factors_of_Adolescent.10.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/familyandcommunityhealth\/Fulltext\/2016\/10000\/Exploring_the_Contextual_Factors_of_Adolescent.10.aspx?utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/familyandcommunityhealth\/2016\/10000\/Exploring_the_Contextual_Factors_of_Adolescent.10.pdf","pmid":"27536935","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"301","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Exploring the Contextual Factors of Adolescent Obesity in an Underserved Population Through Photovoice","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/familyandcommunityhealth\/Fulltext\/2016\/10000\/Exploring_the_Contextual_Factors_of_Adolescent.10.aspx","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-contextual-factors-adolescent-obesity-underserved-population-through-photovoice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":4185460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3915503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254447,"mean":12.332773507934,"rank":128726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":115524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254447,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":348,"mean":2.025492795389,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":348,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
