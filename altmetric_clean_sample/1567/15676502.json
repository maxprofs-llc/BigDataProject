Using primer pairs Cry9\/Cry15 and LaxA\/LaxB for Cryptosporidium and Gdh1\/Gdh4 for Giardia, the sensitivity of the entire detection procedure (dealing with concentration, separation, DNA purification and PCR amplification) was at the level of 50-100 oocysts and cysts. Of 54 surface water samples, 4 were positive for Cryptosporidium and 1 for Giardia. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were detected for the first time in surface water in Finland.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e54","authors":["Ruska Rimhanen-Finne","Ari H\u00f6rman","Pilvi Ronkainen","Marja-Liisa H\u00e4nninen"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0167-7012(02)00047-7","endpage":"303","first_seen_on":"2017-01-23T00:06:57+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["01677012","0167-7012"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Microbiological Methods","last_mentioned_on":1483228800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0167-7012(02)00047-7"],"pmid":"12031580","pubdate":"2002-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"299","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"An IC-PCR method for detection of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in natural surface waters in Finland","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0167701202000477","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/icpcr-method-detection-cryptosporidium-giardia-natural-surface-waters-finland"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8045209,"mean":6.83634500562,"rank":2019613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4922683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8045209,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256767,"mean":12.844853251599,"rank":89507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":162679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256767,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":819,"mean":2.3938337408313,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":819,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":5.0795,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
