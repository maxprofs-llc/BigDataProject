Muscle biopsy hallmarks include perifascicular atrophy, loss of intramuscular capillaries, perivascular and perimysial inflammation and the overexpression of IFN-inducible genes. Among them, the retinoic-acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) is specifically overexpressed in perifascicular areas of dermatomyositis muscle. The aim of this work was to study if RIG-I expression may be modulated by hypoxia using an in vitro approach. We identified putative hypoxia response elements (HRE) in RIG-I regulatory regions and luciferase assays confirmed that RIG-I is a new HIF-inducible gene. We observed an increase expression of RIG-I both by Real time PCR and Western blot in hypoxic conditions in human muscle cells. Cell transfection with a constitutive RIG-I expression vector increased levels of phospho-IRF-3, indicating that RIG-I promotes binding of transcription factors to the enhancer sequence of IFN. Moreover, release of IFN-\u03b2 was observed in hypoxic conditions. Finally, HIF-1\u03b1 overexpression was confirmed in the muscle biopsies and in some RIG-I positive perifascicular muscle fibres but not in controls. Our results indicate that hypoxia triggers the production of IFN-I in vitro, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of DM together with other inflammatory factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Noem\u00ed De Luna","Xavier Su\u00e1rez-Calvet","Cinta Lleix\u00e0","Jordi Diaz-Manera","Montse Oliv\u00e9","Isabel Illa","Eduard Gallardo"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-09309-8","first_seen_on":"2017-08-19T10:08:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1503160746,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28819164?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28819164?dopt=Abstractu0026utm_source=dlvr.itu0026utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28819164","subjects":["science"],"title":"Hypoxia triggers IFN-I production in muscle: Implications in dermatomyositis","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypoxia-triggers-ifni-production-muscle-implications-dermatomyositis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":4237911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3942817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165899,"mean":12.81644854067,"rank":82361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":75970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165899,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37322,"mean":14.707002652662,"rank":19709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":15883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37322,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3683,"mean":13.24171700163,"rank":1891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3683,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
