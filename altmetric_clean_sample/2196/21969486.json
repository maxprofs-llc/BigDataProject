Conventional needle access into the pericardial space is considered quite challenging, and it is often associated with several potential complications particularly inadvertent right ventricular puncture. The novel EpiAccess Needle tip is embedded with a pressure sensor able to report the pressure waveform in real time when used with the EpiAccess System.\nWe evaluated the feasibility and safety of the EpiAccess\u00aeSystem by EpiEP, Inc., with a novel epicardial access needle in a multicenter study.\nTwenty five patients with a clinical need for epicardial access were enrolled. The EpiAccess Needle and EpiAccess System were used for epicardial access in each case. Successful epicardial access, defined as the ability to introduce a guidewire into the epicardial space, was assessed via the device and confirmed with fluoroscopy. Significant pericardial bleeding was defined as >80 mL was defined using peer review article definitions.\nPatients were male (76%) with a mean age of 61.9 (range 28.4 to 84.1) years. Epicardial access for VT ablation was indicated in 76% of the patients. Successful epicardial access was obtained in all cases with pressure monitoring indicating pericardial wire access in all cases. One delayed pericardial effusion occurred.\nEpicardial access with the novel EpiAccess Needle and System with real time pressure monitoring is feasible and safe. The pressure monitoring capability identifies successfully the epicardial space, facilitating access and potentially minimizing complications. This has relevant clinical implications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007602","authors":["Luigi Di Biase","J.
