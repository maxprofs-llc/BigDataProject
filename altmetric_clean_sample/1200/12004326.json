This case shows how the state and the Church are deeply implicated in each other's projects of redemption and the creation of new forms of life. In Italy, the legal model for rehabilitating foreign prostitutes is avowedly secular yet also deeply shaped by a Catholic impetus to purify sinners. At the same time, however, the nuns themselves develop an understanding of redemption as a secular life-saving project in line with the state's project of recognition, and thus inscribe their practices within the biopolitical effort to transform lives. Ultimately, I argue, leading by example becomes a specific Catholic instantiation of biopolitics that characterizes both the state's and the Church's approach to foreigners.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f610001420","authors":["Cristiana Giordano"],"doi":"10.1080\/01459740.2015.1076410","endpage":"290","first_seen_on":"2016-09-14T22:26:29+00:00","issns":["1545-5882","0145-9740"],"issue":"3","journal":"Medical Anthropology","last_mentioned_on":1477496397,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/01459740.2015.1076410","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/01459740.2015.1076410?journalCode=gmea20"],"pmid":"26258728","pubdate":"2015-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"278","subjects":["anthropology","socialsciences"],"title":"Secular Redemptions: Biopolitics by Example","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/secular-redemptions-biopolitics-example"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.5,"score_history":{"1y":11.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7596091,"mean":6.5461949734624,"rank":633644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6956854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7596091,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242993,"mean":12.174686960887,"rank":32664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":210119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242993,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277,"mean":7.1119637681159,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":6.2428571428571,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Special Issue!
