In this work, the incorporation of colistin, a potent lipopeptide into a self-healable hydrogel (via dynamic imine bond formation) following the chemical reaction between the amine groups present in glycol chitosan and an aldehyde-modified poly(ethylene glycol), is reported. The storage module (G') of the colistin-loaded hydrogel ranges from 1.3 to 5.3 kPa by varying the amount of the cross-linker and colistin loading providing different options for topical wound healing. The majority of the colistin is released from the hydrogel within 24 h and remains active as demonstrated by both antibacterial in vitro disk diffusion and time-kill assays. Moreover and pleasingly, the colistin-loaded hydrogel performs almost equally well as native colistin against both the colistin-sensitive and also colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa strain in the in vivo animal \"burn\" infection model despite exhibiting a slower killing profile in vitro. Based on this antibiotic performance along with the biodegradability of the product, it is believed the colistin-loaded hydrogel to be a potential localized wound-healing formulation to treat burn wounds against microbial infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008093","authors":["Zhu, Chongyu","Zhao, Jinxin","Kempe, Kristian","Wilson, Paul","Wang, Jiping","Velkov, Tony","Li, Jian","Davis, Thomas P","Whittaker, Michael R","Haddleton, David M","Davis, Thomas P.","Whittaker, Michael R.","Haddleton, David M.","Chongyu Zhu","Jinxin Zhao","Kristian Kempe","Paul Wilson","Jiping Wang","Tony Velkov","Jian Li","Thomas P.
