Patient handling activities such as lifting present the highest risk of injury, activities that begin in nursing school. A literature review identified 21 studies of back pain in nursing students, indicating a wide range of prevalence rates. A prospective cohort study of nursing students in a United States baccalaureate program followed 119 students who completed the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire upon beginning the 16\u2009month upper division major and then a year later. There was no statistically significant change in low back pain prevalence over time. While nursing students have intermittent and brief exposure to patient handling activities, nursing schools must nevertheless protect them before they enter the high risk profession of nursing by teaching evidence-based safe patient handling techniques, empowering students to refuse unsafe manual lifts, and ensuring that the clinical settings with which they affiliate have adequate mechanical equipment available.","authors":["Menzel, Nancy","Feng, Du","Doolen, Jessica"],"doi":"10.1515\/ijnes-2015-0057","first_seen_on":"2016-09-15T05:45:27+00:00","issns":["1548-923X"],"issue":"1","journal":"International journal of nursing education scholarship","last_mentioned_on":1473897602,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1515\/ijnes-2015-0057"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.degruyter.com\/downloadpdf\/j\/ijnes.2016.13.issue-1\/ijnes-2015-0057\/ijnes-2015-0057.xml","pmid":"27176750","pubdate":"2016-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["nursing","education"],"title":"Low Back Pain in Student Nurses: Literature Review and Prospective Cohort Study","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-back-pain-student-nurses-literature-review-prospective-cohort-study-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Low Back Pain in Student Nurses: Literature Review and Prospective Cohort Study. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10154498148958252&id=191900433251","license":"public","citation_ids":[12008576,12008576],"posted_on":"2016-09-15T00:00:02+00:00","summary":"Low Back Pain in Student Nurses\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27176750","author":{"name":"Exercises for Injuries","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/191900433251","facebook_wall_name":"Exercises for Injuries","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/191900433251\/picture","id_on_source":"191900433251"}}]}}
