In this study, we report the fabrication, characterization and in vitro cytocompatibility of true 3D (>1 mm in all three dimensions), macroscopic (3-8 mm in height and 4-6 mm in diameter), chemically crosslinked graphene scaffolds prepared via radical initiated thermal crosslinking of single- and multi-walled graphene oxide nanoribbons (SWGONRs and MWGONRs). SWGONR and MWGONR scaffolds possess tunable porosity (\u223c65-80%) and interconnected macro-, micro- and nano- scale pores. Human adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) and murine MC3T3 pre-osteoblast cells show good cell viability on SWGONR and MWGONR scaffolds after 1, 3, and 5 days comparable to 3D poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) scaffolds. Confocal live cell imaging showed that cells were metabolically active and could spread on SWGONR and MWGONR scaffolds. Immunofluorescence imaging showed the presence of focal adhesion protein vinculin and expression of cell proliferation marker Ki-67 suggesting that cells could attach and proliferate on SWGONR and MWGONR scaffolds. These results indicate that crosslinked SWGONR and MWGONR scaffolds are cytocompatible and opens-avenues towards the development of 3D multifunctional graphene scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.
