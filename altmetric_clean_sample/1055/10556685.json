The oral administration of diosmin\/hesperidin has been used as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of pycnogenol and diosmin\/hesperidin on the healing of venous ulcers.\nThis longitudinal, prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted with 30 adult patients with venous ulcers from a vascular surgery outpatient clinic of a university hospital. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups: group 1 (n=15) was treated with pycnogenol (50 mg orally, three-times daily), and group 2 (n=15) was treated with diosmin\/hesperidin (450\/50 mg orally, twice daily). They were assessed every 15 days for 90 days. During follow-up visits, photo-documentation was obtained and the ulcer area and circumference of the affected limb were measured. Friedman's test and the Mann-Whitney test were used to compare ulcer areas and circumference of affected limbs between and within groups at the different time points. The level of significance was set at 5% (P<0.05) for all tests.\nBoth the pycnogenol and diosmin\/hesperidin treatments had a similar effect on the healing of venous ulcers and led to a significant decrease in the circumference of affected limbs (P<0.0001).\nThe results suggest that pycnogenol has an adjuvant effect on the healing of venous ulcers, similar to diosmin\/hesperidin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a37","authors":["Toledo, Renato Riera","de Castro Santos, Maria Elisabeth Renn\u00f3","Schnaider, Taylor Brand\u00e3o"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.avsg.2016.04.014","first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T18:43:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1615-5947","08905096"],"journal":"Annals of Vascular Surgery (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1471372427,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27521821"],"pmid":"27521821","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Effect of Pycnogenol on the Healing of Venous Ulcers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-pycnogenol-healing-venous-ulcers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":7116911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233174,"mean":12.38882374889,"rank":198024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233174,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":617,"mean":1.3338993506494,"rank":395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":617,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.7552631578947,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
