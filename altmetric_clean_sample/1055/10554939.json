Moreover, the expression of SIRT1 was significantly decreased while that of APP was increased in AD patients. These results indicated a correlation of DNA methylation with gene expression levels in AD patients. To further investigate the epigenetic mechanism of gene modulation in AD, we used two epigenetic drugs, the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), to treat human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells in the presence of amyloid \u03b2-peptide A\u03b225-35(A\u03b225-35). We found that DAC and TSA had different effects on the expression trends of SIRT1 and APP in the cell model of amyloid toxicity. Although other genes, such as microtubule-associated protein \u03c4, presenilin 1, presenilin 2, and apolipoprotein E, were up-regulated after A\u03b225-35 treatment, no significant differences were found after DAC and\/or TSA treatment. These results support the evidence in AD patients and reveal a strong correlation of SIRT1\/APP expression with DNA methylation and\/or histone modification, which may help understand the pathogenesis of AD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082b2","authors":["Hou, Yaping","Wang, Fanghua","Cheng, Linping","Luo, Tao","Xu, Jie","Wang, Huaqiao"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12264-016-0052-7","first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T16:21:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1995-8218","1673-7067"],"journal":"Neuroscience Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1471648375,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27522594?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27522594"],"pmid":"27522594","pubdate":"2016-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Anatomy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Anesthesiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Expression Profiles of SIRT1 and APP Genes in Human Neuroblastoma SK-N-SH Cells Treated with Two Epigenetic Agents","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-profiles-sirt1-app-genes-human-neuroblastoma-sknsh-cells-treated-two-epigenetic-agents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":923385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7312586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233754,"mean":12.365693924784,"rank":39086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":193925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233754,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":3.2336859504132,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.3214285714286,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
