Unlike thermal or electrocatalytic decomposition on precious metal catalysts, a photocatalytic route to decomposing these liquid-phase materials can offer triggered onboard production of H2 and help mitigate the safety issues concerned with H2 storage. We have investigated visible-light induced H2 evolution from aqueous hydrazine using CdS quantum dots (QDs) as metal-free photocatalysts. Hydrazine acts as a H2 carrier as well as a donor, giving rise to a visible-light induced H2 evolution activity as high as 33 mmol h(-1) g(-1) at pH 8. This has been achieved by the use of CdS QDs capped with S(2-) ligands. The use of larger ligands such as mercaptopropionic acid hinders the adsorption of hydrazine onto CdS QDs and significantly decreases the activity. The effect of pH on the hydrogen yield in aqueous hydrazine has also been examined.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["manoj kumar jana","Uttam Gupta","Chintamani Nagesa Ramachandra Rao","Manoj K.
