T2DM is known to potentiate CAD which had led to the coining of a new clinical entity named diabetic CAD (DM-CAD), leading to excessive morbidity and mortality. The synergistic interaction between these two comorbidities is through sterile inflammation which is now being addressed as metabolic inflammation or metainflammation, which plays a pivotal role during both early and late stages of T2DM and also serves as a link between T2DM and CAD. This review summarises the current concepts on the role played by both innate and adaptive immune responses in setting up metainflammation in DM-CAD. More specifically, the role played by innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD1-like receptors (NLRs), Rig-1-like receptors (RLRs), and C-type lectin like receptors (CLRs) and metabolic endotoxemia in fuelling metainflammation in DM-CAD would be discussed. Further, the role played by adaptive immune cells (Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th9 cells) in fuelling metainflammation in DM-CAD will also be discussed.","altmetric_jid":"56b367f82a83eea9718b4799","authors":["Aravindhan, Vivekanandhan"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/6264149","first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T21:02:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6745","2314-6753"],"journal":"Journal of Diabetes Research","last_mentioned_on":1471381338,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/jdr\/2016\/6264149\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/jdr\/2016\/6264149.pdf","pmid":"27610390","pubdate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Metainflammation in Diabetic Coronary Artery Disease: Emerging Role of Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metainflammation-diabetic-coronary-artery-disease-emerging-role-innate-adaptive-immune-responses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":3560302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4546123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233174,"mean":12.388753629279,"rank":95240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":133605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233174,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":440,"mean":3.8628337129841,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":440,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":4.8470588235294,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":3},"mendeley":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Glycosmedia\/statuses\/765654940421414912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10558579],"posted_on":"2016-08-16T21:02:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Glycosmedia","url":"http:\/\/www.glycosmedia.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/133710593\/Glycos_icon_normal.jpg","description":"A diabetes news service for healthcare professionals","id_on_source":"Glycosmedia","tweeter_id":"29518325","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1259},"tweet_id":"765654940421414912"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/desangsue\/statuses\/765654939158863872","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10558579],"posted_on":"2016-08-16T21:02:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Sue Marshall","url":"http:\/\/www.desang.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1482622032\/tw_11537688_1312716552_normal.jpg","description":"Writer and communicator about diabetes.
