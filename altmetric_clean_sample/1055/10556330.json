In order to monitor all procedures undergone in Austria, the Austrian Society of Hypertension established the investigator-initiated Austrian Transcatheter Renal Denervation (TREND) Registry. From April 2011 to September 2014, 407 procedures in 14 Austrian centres were recorded. At baseline, office and mean 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) were 171\/94 and 151\/89 mmHg, respectively, and patients were taking a median of 4 antihypertensive medications. Mean 24-h ABP changes after 2-6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months were -11\/-6, -8\/-4, -8\/-5 and -10\/-6 mmHg (p<0.05 at all measurements), respectively. The periprocedural complication rate was 2.5%. Incidence of long-term complications during follow-up (median 1 year) was 0.5%. Office BP and ABP responses showed only a weak correlation (Pearson coefficient 0.303). Based on the data from the TREND registry, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in addition to office BP should be used for patient selection as well as for monitoring response to RDN. Furthermore, criteria for optimal patient selection are suggested.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["David Zweiker","Thomas Lambert","Clemens Steinwender","Thomas Weber","Markus Suppan","Helmut Brussee","Christian Koppelst\u00e4tter","Julia Kerschbaum","Bruno Watschinger","Katharina Hohenstein-Scheibenecker","Roman Reindl-Schwaighofer","Thomas Sturmberger","Claudia Kindslehner","Thomas Werner Weiss","Miklos Rohla","Peter Gruener","Petra Maister","Johann Auer","Cornelia Dechant","Josef Sykora","Christoph Krismer","Stefan Glaser","Robert Zweiker"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0161250","first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T18:03:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1471368934,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0161250"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0161250.PDF","pmid":"27529426","pubdate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0161250","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Effects of Renal Denervation Documented in the Austrian National Multicentre Renal Denervation Registry","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-renal-denervation-documented-austrian-national-multicentre-renal-denervation-registry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":7116936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233174,"mean":12.388874355092,"rank":198032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233174,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114045,"mean":10.581305092771,"rank":96226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114045,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4328,"mean":10.086113704645,"rank":3782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4328,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
