Environmental variables used in modeling consisted of 42 environmental and climate variables for Nayband wildlife refuge and 36 environmental and climate variables for Petregan protected area. Also, seasonal overlap area were obtained using the ENM TOOLS software. The results showed that the most important factors affecting habitat suitability of the Asian Houbara in all seasons included the ratio of distance to hill, the type of Artemisia-Gymnocarpus, distance to the slope (8-12%) in the Nayband wildlife refuge, distance to the type of Artemisia aucheri, distance to the Land Passion, and distance to the dry land farming in the Petregan region. In summer, the most suitable habitat is Nayband but is Petergan during fall-winter. there is maximum overlap in summer, and the least overlap in the spring these areas. The results of this study can be used as a valuable tool in implementing conservation and management strategies, in order to increase desirable habitats in the eastern part of Iran.","altmetric_jid":"559e7dba2a83ee49088b4588","authors":["Ali Haghania","Mansour Aliabadian","Jalil Sarhangzadeh","Ahad Setoodehc","Ali Haghani","Ahad Setoodeh"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.heliyon.2016.e00142","first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T19:57:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2405-8440","24058440"],"issue":"8","journal":"Heliyon","last_mentioned_on":1471448266,"links":["http:\/\/www.heliyon.com\/article\/e00142\/","http:\/\/www.heliyon.com\/article\/e00142\/?sf33538083=1","http:\/\/www.heliyon.com\/article\/e00142\/?sf33538119=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.heliyon.com\/article\/e00142\/pdf","pmid":"27570839","pubdate":"2016-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","startpage":"e00142","title":"Seasonal habitat suitability modeling and factors affecting the distribution of Asian Houbara in East Iran","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seasonal-habitat-suitability-modeling-factors-affecting-distribution-asian-houbara-east-iran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":1986579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6232693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233220,"mean":12.3887975508,"rank":72157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":160523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233220,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296,"mean":14.106501694915,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":13.762,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
