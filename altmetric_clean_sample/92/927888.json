It is assumed that antibiotics are efficacious for all bronchiectasis exacerbations, but not all practitioners agree. Inadequately treated exacerbations may risk lung function deterioration. Our study tests the hypothesis that both oral azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid are superior to placebo at improving resolution rates of respiratory exacerbations by day 14 in children with bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a6","authors":["Chang AB","Robertson CF","Grimwood K","van Asperen PP","Wilson AC","O 8217 Grady KA","Sloots TP","Torzillo PJ","Bailey EJ","McCallum GB","Masters IB","Byrnes CA","Buntain HM","Mackay IM","Morris PS","Chatfield MD","Anne B Chang","Keith Grimwood","Colin F Robertson","Andrew C Wilson","Peter P van Asperen","Kerry-Ann F O\u2019Grady","Theo P Sloots","Paul J Torzillo","Emily J Bailey","Gabrielle B McCallum","Ian B Masters","Catherine A Byrnes","Mark D Chatfield","Helen M Buntain","Ian M Mackay","Peter S Morris"],"doi":"10.1186\/1745-6215-13-156","first_seen_on":"2012-09-04T10:31:49+00:00","issns":["1745-6215",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Trials","last_mentioned_on":1346754678,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22937736?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22937736","pubdate":"2012-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Statistics for Life Sciences, Medicine, Health Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Antibiotics for bronchiectasis exacerbations in children: rationale and study protocol for a randomised placebo-controlled trial.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1745-6215-13-156","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibiotics-bronchiectasis-exacerbations-children-rationale-study-protocol-randomised-placebocontrol-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3561647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79072,"mean":5.4102603482946,"rank":63651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79072,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1428,"mean":4.135456201822,"rank":1216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1428,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":4.1869259259259,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
