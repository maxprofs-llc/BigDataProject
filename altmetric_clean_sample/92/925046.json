We describe a new biometric approach to personal identification using eigenfinger and eigenpalm features, with fusion applied at the matching-score level. The identification process can be divided into the following phases: capturing the image; preprocessing; extracting and normalizing the palm and strip-like finger subimages; extracting the eigenpalm and eigenfinger features based on the K-L transform; matching and fusion; and, finally, a decision based on the (k, l)-NN classifier and thresholding. The system was tested on a database of 237 people (1,820 hand images). The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the system in terms of the recognition rate (100 percent), the equal error rate (EER = 0.58 percent), and the total error rate (TER = 0.72 percent).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a67","authors":["Ribaric, S."],"doi":"10.1109\/tpami.2005.209","first_seen_on":"2012-09-02T08:02:20+00:00","issns":["0162-8828"],"issue":"11","journal":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1346571681,"links":["http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org:80\/xpl\/login.jsp?reload=true&tp=&arnumber=1512051&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F34%2F32376%2F01512051.pdf%3Farnumber%3D1512051"],"pmid":"16285370","pubdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IEEE","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Computer Software","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"A biometric identification system based on eigenpalm and eigenfinger features","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biometric-identification-system-based-eigenpalm-eigenfinger-features"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2311865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1575803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78908,"mean":5.369482352643,"rank":37265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":30608,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78908,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":903,"mean":1.5626829268293,"rank":367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":903,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.9,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
