Women have been underrepresented in most studies of cardiovascular disease. Reduced physical fitness has been shown to increase the risk of death in men. Exercise capacity measured by exercise stress test is an objective measure of physical fitness. The hypothesis that reduced exercise capacity is associated with an increased risk of death was investigated in a cohort of 5721 asymptomatic women who underwent baseline examinations in 1992.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057f2","authors":["Gulati, Martha","Pandey, Dilip K","Arnsdorf, Morton F","Lauderdale, Diane S","Thisted, Ronald A","Wicklund, Roxanne H","Al-Hani, Arfan J","Black, Henry R"],"doi":"10.1161\/01.cir.0000091080.57509.e9","first_seen_on":"2012-09-02T19:28:46+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1524-4539"],"issue":"13","journal":"Circulation","last_mentioned_on":1346577020,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12975254"],"pmid":"12975254","pubdate":"2003-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Exercise capacity and the risk of death in women: the St James Women Take Heart Project.","type":"article","volume":"108","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exercise-capacity-risk-death-women-st-james-women-take-heart-project"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":2906137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75595,"mean":5.0629675635632,"rank":56094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75595,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5611,"mean":7.5236434937611,"rank":4686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5611,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.7693513513514,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Ph.
