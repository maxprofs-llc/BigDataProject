My first venture into the funny world of Actinobacteria :-0"],"citation":{"abstract":"The ability to use the sialic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac, as a nutrient has been characterized in a number of bacteria, most of which are human pathogens that encounter this molecule because of its presence on mucosal surfaces. The soil bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum also has a full complement of genes for sialic acid catabolism, and we demonstrate that it can use Neu5Ac as a sole source of carbon and energy and isolate mutants with a much reduced growth lag on Neu5Ac. Disruption of the cg2937 gene, encoding a component of a predicted sialic acid-specific ABC transporter, results in a complete loss of growth of C. glutamicum on Neu5Ac and also a complete loss of [(14)C]-Neu5Ac uptake into cells. Uptake of [(14)C]-Neu5Ac is induced by pregrowth on Neu5Ac, but the additional presence of glucose prevents this induction. The demonstration that a member of the Actinobacteria can transport and catabolize Neu5Ac efficiently suggests that sialic acid metabolism has a physiological role in the soil environment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c4","authors":["Gruteser N","Marin K","Kr\u00e4mer R","Thomas GH"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1574-6968.2012.02663.x","first_seen_on":"2012-09-01T13:30:35+00:00","funders":["bbsrc"],"issns":["0378-1097"],"issue":"","journal":"FEMS Microbiology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1346506049,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22924979\/"],"pmid":"22924979","pubdate":"2012-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Sialic acid utilisation by the soil bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sialic-acid-utilization-soil-bacterium-corynebacterium-glutamicum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3095246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":973311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78631,"mean":5.3894043749205,"rank":50945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78631,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1027,"mean":2.220395711501,"rank":697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1027,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
