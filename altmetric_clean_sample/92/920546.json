However, BRCA1 can be inactivated by multiple mechanisms and determining its status is not a trivial issue. As an alternate approach, we profiled 65 BLC cases using single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to define a signature of BRCA1-associated genomic instability. Large-scale state transitions (LST), defined as chromosomal break between adjacent regions of at least 10 Mb, were found to be a robust indicator of BRCA1 status in this setting. Two major ploidy-specific cutoffs in LST distributions were sufficient to distinguish highly rearranged BLCs with 85% of proven BRCA1-inactivated cases from less rearranged BLCs devoid of proven BRCA1-inactivated cases. The genomic signature we defined was validated in a second independent series of 55 primary BLC cases and 17 BLC-derived tumor cell lines. High numbers of LSTs resembling BRCA1-inactivated BLC were observed in 4 primary BLC cases and 2 BLC cell lines that harbored BRCA2 mutations. Overall, the genomic signature we defined predicted BRCA1\/2 inactivation in BLCs with 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity (97% accuracy). This assay may ease the challenge of selecting patients for genetic testing or recruitment to clinical trials of novel emerging therapies that target DNA repair deficiencies in cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Marc-Henri Stern"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-12-1470","first_seen_on":"2012-08-30T08:04:05+00:00","issns":["1538-7445"],"journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1350979274,"links":["http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/08\/29\/0008-5472.CAN-12-1470.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/08\/29\/0008-5472.CAN-12-1470.full.pdf","pmid":"22933060","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Ploidy and large-scale genomic instability consistently identify basal-like breast carcinomas with BRCA1\/2 inactivation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ploidy-largescale-genomic-instability-consistently-identify-basallike-breast-carcinomas-brca12-inact"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":964441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78319,"mean":5.4037854899257,"rank":50691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78319,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5723,"mean":3.9630636141209,"rank":4290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":1066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5723,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.837037037037,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
