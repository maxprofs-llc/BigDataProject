This study relied on qualitative interviews with 49 low-income Latina mothers to examine how parenting practices are used when facing neighborhood poverty and the threat of community violence. Several themes emerged in the interviews regarding mothers' approaches to parenting. First, Latina mothers in our sample relied on three strategies previously identified in the literature: (a) strict monitoring, (b) physical and\/or social withdrawal from the neighborhood, and (c) engagement in positive, enriching activities for children. In concert with these strategies, these mothers also emphasized the importance of (d) establishing strong parent-child communication as essential to effective parenting in challenging environments. Furthermore, two overarching, culturally salient parental goals were identified: (a) fostering principles of educaci\u00f3n in their children and (b) maintaining astute parental awareness (estar pendiente) of children's physical as well as emotional states. Our findings illuminated culturally specific meanings that accompany parenting practices for low-income Latina mothers and underscored the importance of adapting culturally sensitive interventions for parents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002da3","doi":"10.1037\/a0029584","first_seen_on":"2012-08-29T23:50:56+00:00","issns":["1939-1293"],"journal":"Journal of Family Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1365503657,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22924421?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22924421","pubdate":"2012-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Always Aware (Siempre Pendiente): Latina Mothers' Parenting in High-Risk Neighborhoods.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/always-aware-siempre-pendiente-latina-mothers-parenting-highrisk-neighborhoods"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1990119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78505,"mean":5.3911949709569,"rank":29857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":46455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78505,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":411,"mean":5.7704146341463,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":411,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.225,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
