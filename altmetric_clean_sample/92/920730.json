We designed a cross-sectional study to assess knowledge and attitudes towards HIV\/AIDS of private practicing physicians in Mashhad, Iran. A total of 346 general practitioners and specialists completed anonymous self-administered questionnaires with response rate of 91.1%. For knowledge questions, the mean proportion of correct responses was 53.5% (\u00b113.2). Misconceptions about HIV transmission were the main areas of insufficient knowledge. Surprisingly only 20% knew how to manage a patient who had experienced sexual contact with an HIV-positive partner. While 84% disagreed that 'HIV-infected individuals deserved to catch infection' owing to high-risk behaviours, 38% sympathized less with people who were infected via extramarital sex. It seems that knowledge and attitudes towards HIV\/AIDS among the studied physicians is not favourable and is an area that requires attention to enable effective management of the disease in Iran.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006615","doi":"10.1258\/ijsa.2009.009447","first_seen_on":"2012-08-30T10:09:33+00:00","issns":["1758-1052"],"issue":"8","journal":"International Journal of STD & AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1346997989,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22930308?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22930308","pubdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Knowledge and attitudes of physicians in private practice towards HIV\/AIDS in Mashhad, Iran.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/knowledge-attitudes-physicians-private-practice-towards-hivaids-mashhad-iran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6351240,"mean":5.9815274440155,"rank":2222061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4094699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6351240,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85727,"mean":5.8429651214334,"rank":27579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":57516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85727,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":900,"mean":2.1311790878754,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":900,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.7894736842105,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
