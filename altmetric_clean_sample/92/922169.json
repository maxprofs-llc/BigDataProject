Germline BAP1 mutations have been recently associated with an increased risk of malignant mesothelioma, atypical melanocytic tumors and other neoplasms. To answer the question if different germline BAP1 mutations may predispose to a single syndrome with a wide phenotypic range or to distinct syndromes, we investigated the presence of melanocytic tumors in two unrelated families (L and W) with germline BAP1 mutations and increased risk of malignant mesothelioma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","authors":["Michele Carbone","Michele Carbone","Laura Korb Ferris","Francine Baumann","Andrea Napolitano","Christopher A Lum","Erin G Flores","Giovanni Gaudino","Amy Powers","Peter Bryant-Greenwood","Thomas Krausz","Elizabeth Hyjek","Rachael Tate","Joseph Friedberg","Tracey Weigel","Harvey I Pass","Haining Yang"],"doi":"10.1186\/1479-5876-10-179","first_seen_on":"2012-08-31T02:58:05+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["","1479-5876"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1349688091,"links":["http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/10\/1\/179\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22935333"],"pmid":"22935333","pubdate":"2012-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"179","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"BAP1 cancer syndrome: malignant mesothelioma, uveal and cutaneous melanoma, and MBAITs","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bap1-cancer-syndrome-malignant-mesothelioma-uveal-cutaneous-melanoma-mbaits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":20.988,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":20.988},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":168021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":4339163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78429,"mean":5.4351635130311,"rank":3254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":75175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78429,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1265,"mean":2.674082278481,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1265,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2.9853658536585,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Ph.
