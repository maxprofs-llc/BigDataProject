We found that a majority of mentors provided guidance in responsible research conduct (RCR), and that most of these relationships were deemed helpful. Mentors also responded that they played a greater importance in RCR training of their mentees than the mentees reported. Our results suggest both mentors and mentees report that mentors ideally should play a more important role in RCR training than was actually the case. For conflicting interests, subjects' protection, and misconduct, approximately 50% of K recipients found the mentor to be not at all important or only somewhat important for these areas of RCR training. We conclude the mentor's role is important but not optimal based on the results of our study cohort.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f610001504","authors":[" Elizabeth   Ripley   M.D. "],"doi":"10.1080\/08989621.2012.700880","first_seen_on":"2012-09-04T12:44:44+00:00","funders":["phs"],"issns":["0898-9621"],"issue":"4","journal":"Accountability in Research","last_mentioned_on":1346762674,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/08989621.2012.700880"],"pmid":"22861178","pubdate":"2012-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Guiding the Next Generation of NIH Investigators in Responsible Conduct of Research: The Role of the Mentor","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/guiding-next-generation-nih-investigators-responsible-conduct-research-role-mentor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3107928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":977987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79070,"mean":5.3439777662547,"rank":51531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":18955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79070,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":8.0662626262626,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.3666666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
