What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? It is known that overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms correlate weakly with urodynamic findings, especially in female patients. The study shows that OAB symptoms also correlate weakly with urodynamic findings in male patients. More than third of male patients with OAB symptoms had evidence of BOO. The study finds that a pressure flow study is of benefit in the evaluation of this group of patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245a","authors":["Al\u2010Zahrani, Ali A.","Gajewski, Jerzy B."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1464-410x.2012.11467.x","endpage":"E895","first_seen_on":"2012-08-30T09:52:52+00:00","issns":["1464-410X","1464-4096"],"issue":"11c","journal":"British Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1346408572,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fj.1464-410X.2012.11467.x","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2012.11467.x\/abstract;jsessionid=6C9737609BF644C6402C00A6A17526D1.d04t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2012.11467.x\/abstract;jsessionid=134EE0D3710CCF31B497590322BB1292.d04t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2012.11467.x\/pdf","pmid":"22928556","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"E891","title":"Association of symptoms with urodynamic findings in men with overactive bladder syndrome","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-symptoms-urodynamic-findings-men-overactive-bladder-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6281255,"mean":5.9851595974314,"rank":2201024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4046875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6281255,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85178,"mean":5.8619260833323,"rank":27498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":57044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85178,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1870,"mean":6.169416800428,"rank":945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1870,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.616,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Urology_Wisdom\/status\/241108701811986432","citation_ids":[920677],"posted_on":"2012-08-30T09:42:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Urology & Nephrology","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/bjoaa4f9RA","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/907206829\/twitter_image_normal.png","description":"Organizing urology resources shared by health experts, advocates, and organizations into WisdomCards.","id_on_source":"Urology_Wisdom","tweeter_id":"17204022","geo":{"lt":40.71455,"ln":-74.007124,"country":"US"},"followers":1333},"tweet_id":"241108701811986432"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bladder_OAB\/statuses\/241378789031022592","license":"public","citation_ids":[920677],"posted_on":"2012-08-31T03:36:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Overactive Bladder ","url":"http:\/\/organizedwisdom.com\/Category:Overactive_Bladder","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/63138672\/twitter_image_normal.png","description":"Organizing overactive bladder (OAB) resources shared by health experts, advocates, and organizations into WisdomCards.\r\n","id_on_source":"Bladder_OAB","tweeter_id":"17053640","geo":{"lt":40.71455,"ln":-74.007124,"country":"US"},"followers":218},"tweet_id":"241378789031022592"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/icsoffice\/statuses\/241481171886821377","license":"datasift","rt":["Bladder_OAB"],"citation_ids":[920677],"posted_on":"2012-08-31T10:22:52+00:00","author":{"name":"ICS","url":"http:\/\/www.icsoffice.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/880740932643172352\/8e9k14KC_normal.jpg","description":"The International Continence Society (ICS) is a membership society for medical professionals concerned with incontinence.","id_on_source":"icsoffice","tweeter_id":"95405884","geo":{"lt":51.45523,"ln":-2.59665,"country":"GB"},"followers":2511},"tweet_id":"241481171886821377"}]}}
