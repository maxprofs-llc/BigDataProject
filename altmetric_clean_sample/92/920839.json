We have recently shown significant involvement of (pro)renin receptor ([P]RR) in retinal inflammation in a rodent model of early diabetes. In this study we aim to elucidate the (P)RR-associated pathogenesis of fibrovascular proliferation, a late-stage angiogenic complication in human diabetic retinopathy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007106","doi":"10.1007\/s00125-012-2702-2","first_seen_on":"2012-08-30T10:54:45+00:00","issns":["1432-0428"],"journal":"Diabetologia","last_mentioned_on":1346756548,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22930161?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22930161","pubdate":"2012-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Metabolic Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"(Pro)renin receptor is associated with angiogenic activity in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prorenin-receptor-associated-angiogenic-activity-proliferative-diabetic-retinopathy-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2495467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2389366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80863,"mean":5.736812421162,"rank":35493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":42667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80863,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1511,"mean":10.39780397351,"rank":892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1511,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":8.5816785714286,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
