We did a prospective, non-randomized, comparative study to evaluate ceftazidime plus either levofloxacin or once-daily amikacin as empirical regimens for febrile neutropenia in patients with solid tumor or hematopoietic neoplasm in a region of high baseline resistance prevalence. We included 285 febrile neutropenic episodes in 235 individual patients. One hundred forty-eight cases received levofloxacin and 137 received amikacin, both in combination with ceftazidime. More cases in the levofloxacin than the amikacin group had underlying hematological malignancy; most other characteristics of the two groups were well balanced. Nephrotoxicity requiring treatment discontinuation occurred in one case in the amikacin group. No difference in clinical success (79.7% vs. 80.3%, p>0.99) or all-cause mortality (12.8% vs. 11.7%, p=0.86) was noted between the levofloxacin and the amikacin groups, even after adjustment for the independent predictor variables for each endpoint. Sepsis at presentation, presence of localizing symptoms\/signs of infection, and isolation of a non-susceptible Gram-negative pathogen independently predicted both clinical success and all-cause mortality. Additionally, underlying solid tumor independently predicted clinical success, while poor prognosis of the underlying neoplasia and skin\/soft tissue infection independently predicted mortality. Ceftazidime plus levofloxacin had similar effectiveness to ceftazidime plus amikacin as empirical regimens for febrile neutropenia. Nephrotoxicity with once-daily amikacin was minimal. Inappropriate empirical therapy was associated with worse prognosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002828","authors":["Samonis G","Koutsounaki E","Karageorgopoulos DE","Mitsikostas P","Kalpadaki C","Bozionelou V","Bompolaki I","Sgouros J","Taktikou V","Falagas ME"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10096-011-1454-0","first_seen_on":"2012-08-31T22:27:27+00:00","issns":["0934-9723"],"issue":"","journal":"European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1346451855,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22037822?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22037822","pubdate":"2011-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Empirical therapy with ceftazidime combined with levofloxacin or once-daily amikacin for febrile neutropenia in patients with neoplasia: a prospective comparative study.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/empirical-therapy-ceftazidime-combined-levofloxacin-oncedaily-amikacin-febrile-neutropenia-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3107996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":977976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78428,"mean":5.3970413505552,"rank":51147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":18805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78428,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":633,"mean":1.8516930379747,"rank":401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":633,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.8923076923077,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mlazqui\/statuses\/241662714404016128","license":"public","citation_ids":[923676],"posted_on":"2012-08-31T22:24:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Mart\u00edn L\u00e1zaro","url":"http:\/\/www.novedadesenoncologia.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000653691864\/11d6fb0c77217bfce2c907aa9b0f2ee5_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical oncologist.
