This renewed interest reopens an old, but still unanswered question: how exactly does planning happen? What are the underlying information processing operations and how are they implemented in the brain? Although a range of interesting possibilities exists, recent work has introduced a potentially transformative new idea, according to which planning is accomplished through probabilistic inference.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036a8","authors":["Matthew Botvinick","Marc Toussaint"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tics.2012.08.006","endpage":"488","first_seen_on":"2012-09-04T13:51:37+00:00","issns":["1364-6613","1879-307X"],"issue":"10","journal":"Trends in Cognitive Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1472481748,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/trends\/cognitive-sciences\/abstract\/S1364-6613(12)00195-7","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.cell.com\/trends\/cognitive-sciences\/abstract\/S1364-6613(12)00195-7&rc=0&code=cell-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/download.cell.com\/trends\/cognitive-sciences\/pdf\/PIIS1364661312001957.pdf","pmid":"22940577","pubdate":"2012-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"485","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Planning as inference","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/planning-inference-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372581,"mean":7.0576484307032,"rank":3339324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":5006070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372581,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101704,"mean":6.0163053203937,"rank":34717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":66588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101704,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1304,"mean":23.18649884881,"rank":1060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1304,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":23.218583333333,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Researcher":47,"Student  > Ph.
