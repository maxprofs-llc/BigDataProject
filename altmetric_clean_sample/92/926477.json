Specifically it provides a description of two indigenous illnesses--isihuayo and necaxantle, it discusses their etiology, symptoms, and treatments, and it analyzes them within the local ethnomedical framework and sociopolitical context. A perception of female vulnerability is shown to be an underlying shaper of women's experiences of these illnesses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000084f","authors":["Vania Smith-Oka"],"doi":"10.1186\/1746-4269-8-33","first_seen_on":"2012-09-03T15:31:42+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["","1746-4269"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1359563198,"links":["http:\/\/www.ethnobiomed.com\/content\/8\/1\/33\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1746-4269-8-33?site=ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"22913545","pubdate":"2012-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary & Alternative Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"33","subjects":["medicine","socialsciences"],"title":"An analysis of two indigenous reproductive health illnesses in a Nahua community in Veracruz, Mexico","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-two-indigenous-reproductive-health-illnesses-nahua-community-veracruz-mexico"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.814,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.814},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8037685,"mean":6.8229478924494,"rank":836818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7200843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8037685,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100607,"mean":5.9238564101544,"rank":10526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":90081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100607,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":476,"mean":3.8126947368421,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":476,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.2654545454545,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
