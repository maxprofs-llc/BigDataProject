Competition experiments and (19)F-NMR studies indicate that the cycloaddition occurs preferentially between the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated acyl fluoride and the unstabilised azomethine ylide. In addition, an enantioselective variant, using chiral isothiourea catalysts, has been achieved with 14% ee.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083f3","authors":["Shveta Pandiancherri","Sarah J.
