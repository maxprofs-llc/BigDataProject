Intravenous pressure measurements using the traditional microcatheter technique can be cumbersome, time consuming and potentially unreliable. The PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire conducts pressure electrically and can be used as a guidewire for intervention. It has been validated in interventional cardiology procedures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f61000406e","authors":["Demetrius Klee Lopes","Andrew Kelly Johnson","Lee A Tan"],"doi":"10.1136\/neurintsurg-2012-010439","first_seen_on":"2012-09-03T05:15:14+00:00","issns":["1759-8486"],"journal":"Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1346649115,"links":["http:\/\/jnis.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2012\/08\/30\/neurintsurg-2012-010439.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jnis.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2012\/08\/30\/neurintsurg-2012-010439.full.pdf","pmid":"22942187","pubdate":"2012-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"New devices","scheme":"bmj"}],"subjects":["generalsurgery","neurology"],"title":"Venous sinus manometry and intervention using the PrimeWire Prestige pressure guidewire: technique and initial experience","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/venous-sinus-manometry-intervention-using-primewire-prestige-pressure-guidewire-technique-initial-ex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7444200,"mean":6.4700409967505,"rank":3829896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2084043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7444200,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97942,"mean":5.6957083550301,"rank":47346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":38065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97942,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":798,"mean":2.2858017565872,"rank":428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":798,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.1571428571429,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Cure4stroke\/statuses\/242490082030936064","license":"public","citation_ids":[925864],"posted_on":"2012-09-03T05:11:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Demetrius Lopes, MD","url":"http:\/\/about.me\/demetriuslopes","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/472790199252959232\/oK82nn62_normal.jpeg","description":"Director Cerebrovascular Neurosurgery - Rush University Medical Center - Cure4stroke Foundation advisory board","id_on_source":"Cure4stroke","tweeter_id":"96493132","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":597},"tweet_id":"242490082030936064"}]}}
