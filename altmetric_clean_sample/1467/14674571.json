The patients' medical files were reviewed for a subsequent diagnosis of CS by an expert endocrinologist. Findings were evaluated for patterns in CS diagnosis and UFC testing over time.\nOf 41,183 individuals tested, 510 (1.2%) had UFC >2x ULN (214 >3x ULN). Eighty-five (16.7%) were diagnosed with CS (63 female, mean age 47.2\u00b115.1 years), mainly Cushing's disease (55.3%) or adrenal Cushing's syndrome (37.6%). The number of UFC tests increased steadily, from 1804 in 2005 to 6464 in 2014, yet the resultant detection rate of CS remained generally stable. The calculated incidence of CS in the general HMO-insured population based only on the patients identified in the present cohort was 4.5 new cases\/million\/year (median 4.9\/million\/year, range 1.7-5.9\/million\/year), which was also relatively stable. The most common reason for referral for UFC screening was obesity. Of 148 patients before bariatric surgery with UFC >2x ULN, 2 were diagnosed with CS.\nThe incidence of CS is higher than previously suggested. The consistently increasing number of UFC tests being performed has not been accompanied by a similar increase in CS detection rate. The expected yield of routine UFC testing before bariatric surgery is low.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002832","authors":["Dania Hirsch","Gloria Tsvetov","Yossi Manisterski","Nirit Aviran-Barak","Varda Nadler","Sandra Alboim","Vered Kopel"],"doi":"10.1530\/eje-16-0631","first_seen_on":"2016-12-12T12:31:14+00:00","issns":["1479-683X"],"journal":"European Journal of Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1483395721,"links":["http:\/\/www.eje-online.org\/content\/176\/1\/41"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.eje-online.org\/content\/176\/1\/41.full.pdf","pmid":"27737902","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Incidence of Cushing's syndrome in patients with significant hypercortisoluria.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incidence-cushings-syndrome-patients-significant-hypercortisoluria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.05,"score_history":{"1y":4.05,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7974292,"mean":6.7330879653071,"rank":1678723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6288331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7974292,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256725,"mean":12.264383688319,"rank":76157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":180072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256725,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1474,"mean":4.2438180583843,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1474,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":19.854066666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
