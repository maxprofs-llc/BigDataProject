Participants should be adult rugby union players (amateur or professional). The study should report a separate skin or laceration injury category and provide sufficient detail to calculate injury prevalence within this category.\nTwelve studies were included. Mean skin injury prevalence during matches was 2.4 injuries per 1000 exposure hours; during training sessions, the prevalence was 0.06 injuries per 1000 exposure hours. Skin injuries accounted for 5.3% of match injuries and 1.7% of training injuries. Skin injury risk was similar for amateur compared with professional players during matches (OR: 0.63, p=0.46.), but higher during training sessions (OR: 9.24, p=0.02).\nThe skin injury prevalence of 2.4 injuries per 1000 exposure hours is equivalent to one time-loss injury sustained during matches per team, per season. Amateur players are more likely to sustain skin injuries during training sessions than professional players. There is a need for more studies observing injuries among amateur players.\nPROSPERO CRD42015024027.","altmetric_jid":"562656fa2a83eefb348b4569","authors":["Bodil Yucki Oudshoorn","Heather Driscoll","Karen Kilner","Marcus Dunn","David James"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjsem-2017-000239","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T18:02:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2055-7647"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1505590501,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopensem.bmj.com\/content\/3\/1\/e000239?rss=1&hootPostID=dc56763ad3bb8ca39801b4efa579a208","http:\/\/bmjopensem.bmj.com\/content\/3\/1\/e000239","http:\/\/bmjopensem.bmj.com\/content\/3\/1\/e000239?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopensem.bmj.com\/content\/bmjosem\/3\/1\/e000239.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5530108","pmid":"28761716","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Specialist Journals","startpage":"e000239","title":"Prevalence of laceration injuries in professional and amateur rugby union: a systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-laceration-injuries-professional-amateur-rugby-union-systematic-review-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.95,"score_history":{"1y":4.95,"6m":4.95,"3m":4.95,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422914,"mean":7.0864000630097,"rank":1715956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6700573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422914,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222745,"mean":12.974996318643,"rank":57822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":164572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222745,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":20.166420289855,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":4.8583333333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":7}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/basem_uk\/statuses\/888096632172052480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22237660],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T18:01:51+00:00","author":{"name":"basem_uk","url":"http:\/\/www.basem.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000539513142\/ee0ddddc873c7097adfbe4505e802ea2_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitter feed for British Association of Sports & Exercise Medicine...connecting with SEM through the twittersphere","id_on_source":"basem_uk","tweeter_id":"1928056208","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":4342},"tweet_id":"888096632172052480"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MscAaronwalters\/statuses\/888099051664814080","license":"gnip","rt":["basem_uk"],"citation_ids":[22237660],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T18:11:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Aaron Walters MSc","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/883395277058580480\/UZl7H7-B_normal.jpg","description":"Physiotherapist working for Exeter chiefs.","id_on_source":"MscAaronwalters","tweeter_id":"882972356225925120","geo":{"lt":50.7236,"ln":-3.52751,"country":"GB"},"followers":17},"tweet_id":"888099051664814080"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yorfac\/statuses\/888125494402588675","license":"gnip","rt":["basem_uk"],"citation_ids":[22237660],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T19:56:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Yorkshire F&A Clinic","url":"http:\/\/www.markfarndon.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/600041866990592000\/w4_YETjD_normal.jpg","description":"Mr Mark Farndon - Specialist Orthopaedic Surgeon Assessment & treatment of foot \/ ankle \/ lower limb conditions & injuries.
