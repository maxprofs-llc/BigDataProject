Better gradation of prognostic indicators are needed to determine which patients may develop serious complications requiring hospitalization, and to provide early guidance on appropriate therapy. In this study, we evaluated 128 patients with smear or real time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed Babesia microti infections over a period of 16 years. Patients with asplenia or immunocompromising conditions were more likely to have severe infection (P < 0.01), require hospitalization (P < 0.01), or receive prolonged courses of antimicrobials (P < 0.01). Nausea or vomiting (P < 0.01) and diarrhea (P < 0.01) along with hyperbilirubinemia (P < 0.01) were predictive of severe infection, hospitalization, and prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Patients with concurrent Lyme disease were less likely to require hospitalization and had similar severity of disease and length of antibiotic treatment compared with those without Lyme disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006990","authors":["Mareedu, Neeharik","Tompkins, Jason","Schotthoefer, Anna M.","Fritsche, Thomas R.","Hall, Matthew C.","Frost, Holly M."],"doi":"10.4269\/ajtmh.17-0146","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T17:49:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0002-9637","1476-1645"],"journal":"The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1500742764,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28722598#","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28722598","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28722598\/"],"pmid":"28722598","pubdate":"2017-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Risk Factors for Severe Infection, Hospitalization, and Prolonged Antimicrobial Therapy in Patients with Babesiosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-severe-infection-hospitalization-prolonged-antimicrobial-therapy-patients-babesiosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":2.5,"3m":2.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255259,"mean":6.9732582659374,"rank":3358367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4838238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255259,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172015,"mean":11.744860092783,"rank":60794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":109826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172015,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4436,"mean":5.0859891770011,"rank":3020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4436,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":7.8304303797468,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1,"SE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ArminLabs\/statuses\/888093509999353856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22237475],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T17:49:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Armin Schwarzbach","url":"http:\/\/www.arminlabs.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/609461481361567745\/Ar--dzAX_normal.jpg","description":"Specialized #lymedisease #Borreliose #ticks #coinfections #tickbornediseases #EliSpot #Tickplex","id_on_source":"ArminLabs","tweeter_id":"3321662363","geo":{"lt":49,"ln":11.5,"country":"DE"},"followers":887},"tweet_id":"888093509999353856"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/angelic75695423\/statuses\/888094379604410368","license":"gnip","rt":["ArminLabs"],"citation_ids":[22237475],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T17:52:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Angelica Johansson","url":"http:\/\/botaborrelia.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/794384497110302725\/KcdzXeuL_normal.jpg","description":"Founder and President of VIDAS.\n\nDelegate of Global Network On Institutionalized Discrimination\n\nLyme Advocate GLliO.\n\nF.Pres. of Lyme Ass.
