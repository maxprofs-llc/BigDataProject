These data provide a valuable resource to help elucidate gene regulation in cochlear development and will benefit ear-related studies, especially those that focus on gene and stem cell therapies in hearing loss.\nTo investigate gene regulation in cochlear development and provide reference information for ear-related research.\nTotal RNA extraction from the Bama miniature pig cochlea was performed at five time points that covered most of the cochlea development process (E42, E49, E56, E91, P13). Transcriptome sequencing was performed by Illumina HiSeq 2500. Transcriptome data were mapped to the genome using TopHat2. Gene expression was quantified using the Cuffquant and Cuffnorm modules. GO and KEGG pathway-enrichment analysis were in progress about the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by Perl programs.\nSequencing of 1778643560000 paired reads revealed 35.9\u2009G of data, and 19,432 expression genes were detected. The ratio of these pairs to the Ensembl genome database was approximately 71% in all samples. The stages E49-E91 and, especially, E49-E56 included the most rapid changes in gene regulation and differentiation for the cochlea. The stem cell characteristics of neural stem cells decreased most rapidly during this period.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5173cf058f610003806","authors":["Wang, Qinghua","Zhang, Yan","Guo, Weiwei","Liu, Yu","Wei, Hong","Yang, Shiming"],"doi":"10.1080\/00016489.2017.1341641","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T16:02:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0001-6489","1651-2251"],"journal":"Acta Oto-Laryngologica","last_mentioned_on":1500566560,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28715930"],"pmid":"28715930","pubdate":"2017-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Transcription analysis of cochlear development in minipigs","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8248040,"mean":6.9694059574582,"rank":7133987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8248040,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168675,"mean":11.69883726004,"rank":137669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168675,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":901,"mean":2.0966466666667,"rank":763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":901,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.87727272727273,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/transcriptomes\/statuses\/888066639433879552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22231531],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T16:02:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Transcriptomes","url":"http:\/\/davetang.org\/muse\/2015\/01\/31\/transcriptome-feed-using-r\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/561190761790574593\/2j6U4lnz_normal.png","description":"A transcriptome feed made using #Rstats.
