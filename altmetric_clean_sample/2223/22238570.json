This study examined the physical and emotional effects of different nature-based environments designed for indoor treadmill running; (2) Methods: In a counterbalanced experimental design, 30 participants performed three, twenty-minute treadmill runs at a self-selected pace while viewing either a static nature image, a dynamic nature image or self-selected entertainment. Distance ran, heart rate (HR) and five pre-and post-exercise emotional states were measured; (3) Results: Participants ran farther, and with higher HRs, with self-selected entertainment compared to the two nature-based environment designs. Participants attained lowered anger, dejection, anxiety and increased excitement post exercise in all of the designed environments. Happiness increased during the two nature-based environment designs compared with self-selected entertainment; (4) Conclusions: Self-selected entertainment encouraged greater physical performances whereas running in nature-based exercise environments elicited greater happiness immediately after running.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Hsiao-Pu Yeh","Joseph Stone","Sarah Churchill","Eric Brymer","Keith Davids"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph14070752","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T18:24:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"7","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1506217176,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/14\/7\/752\/htm","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28696384"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/14\/7\/752\/pdf","pmid":"28696384","pubdate":"2017-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Physical and Emotional Benefits of Different Exercise Environments Designed for Treadmill Running","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physical-emotional-benefits-different-exercise-environments-designed-treadmill-running"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":5,"6m":5,"3m":5,"1m":4.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":1688712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6732459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228615,"mean":12.966279186751,"rank":59311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":168998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228615,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3287,"mean":7.9891028606208,"rank":747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":2531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3287,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200,"mean":9.8157788944724,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
