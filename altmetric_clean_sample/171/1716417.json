Data were collected using qualitative research interviews with a purposive sample of sixteen mothers and ten fathers. Phenomenographic analysis was used to identify conceptions and formulate descriptive categories. The first category, questioning the availability of care, describes mental health care as being unequal in terms of accessibility and lacking in continuity. The second category, disapproval of parental exclusion, illustrates conceptions that mental healthcare professionals disregard parents and do not provide them with adequate information. The third category, questioning the quality of care, encompasses conceptions of lack of trust in the professionals' competence, an unsatisfactory environment as well as inadequate cooperation with other healthcare providers and authorities. Positive aspects, such as being seen and confirmed, were mentioned as valuable by the parents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034c2","authors":["Johansson, Anita","Andershed, Birgitta","Anderzen\u2010Carlsson, Agneta"],"doi":"10.1111\/scs.12074","endpage":"504","first_seen_on":"2013-08-28T19:04:25+00:00","issns":["1471-6712","0283-9318"],"issue":"3","journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1377716623,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/scs.12074\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/scs.12074\/pdf","pmid":"23980612","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"496","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Conceptions of mental health care \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from the perspective of parents' of adult children suffering from mental illness","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conceptions-mental-health-care-perspective-parents-adult-children-suffering-mental-illness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6641961,"mean":6.1504574026314,"rank":4913554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":974747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6641961,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107403,"mean":7.866519785479,"rank":72007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":18293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107403,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240,"mean":2.6962928870293,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.7256,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
