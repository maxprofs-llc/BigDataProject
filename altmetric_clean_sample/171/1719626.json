Up to 1 million cases of HZ are reported annually in the USA with an estimated 10 - 30% of the population being affected by shingles in their lifetime. HZ is a debilitating illness, and while mortality is low, morbidity remains a significant cause for concern with prevention efforts aimed at reducing VZV reactivation and its complications. The HZ vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for individuals aged 50-years or older. However, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices recommends the vaccine in individuals aged 60-years or older.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073bf","authors":["Hung Q Doan","Bothland Ung","Marigdalia K Ramirez-Fort","Farhan Khan","Stephen K Tyring"],"doi":"10.1517\/14712598.2013.830101","endpage":"11","first_seen_on":"2013-08-30T03:24:17+00:00","issns":["1471-2598","1744-7682"],"journal":"Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1377837677,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/14712598.2013.830101","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/14712598.2013.830101?ai=rw&mi=3o53wm&af=R&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed&","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/14712598.2013.830101?ai=rw&mi=3j7h3l&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&"],"pmid":"23984934","pubdate":"2013-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Zostavax : a subcutaneous vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zostavax-subcutaneous-vaccine-prevention-herpes-zoster"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3350292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1481326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98271,"mean":7.898106197212,"rank":62530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":32072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98271,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":749,"mean":2.2856122994652,"rank":473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":749,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.9826666666667,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Mathematics":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ExpertOpinion\/statuses\/373284726590550016","license":"public","citation_ids":[1719626],"posted_on":"2013-08-30T03:23:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Expert Opinion","url":"http:\/\/explore.tandfonline.com\/content\/med\/medicine-hub\/expert-collection","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489823721943625728\/-Bu_ucgW_normal.png","description":"11 peer-reviewed journals, analyzing the pharma research pipeline, phase by phase","id_on_source":"ExpertOpinion","tweeter_id":"29176129","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":1842},"tweet_id":"373284726590550016"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/abe_dental\/statuses\/373304394223083521","license":"public","citation_ids":[1719626],"posted_on":"2013-08-30T04:41:17+00:00","author":{"name":"abe dental","url":"http:\/\/www.abedc.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/583778828\/Abe_logo_blue_normal.gif","description":"\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02\u6771\u533a\u5948\u591a\u306e\u6b6f\u79d1\u533b\u9662\u3001\u3042\u3079\u6b6f\u79d1\u30af\u30ea\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u3059\u3002\u6b6f\u5468\u75c5\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u3001\u5be9\u7f8e\u6b6f\u79d1\u306b\u529b\u3092\u3044\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059","id_on_source":"abe_dental","tweeter_id":"98136416","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":752},"tweet_id":"373304394223083521"}]}}
