However, how HSCT alters the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the tumors is unknown. In this study, we first analyzed the kinetics of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumors after syngeneic HSCT. Unexpectedly, the frequency of CD4\u207a cells expressing Foxp3 was increased in the spleens, whereas the frequency was clearly decreased in the tumors after HSCT. The origin of reconstituted CD4\u207a and Foxp3\u207a cells in the tumors was mainly from the expansion of transferred splenic T cells. Then, to examine the mechanism of Treg suppression after HSCT, we isolated CD11c\u207a cells from tumors. A large amount of Treg-inhibitory cytokine IL-6 was secreted from the CD11c\u207a cells in the tumors, but not in the spleens in the recipient mice. Furthermore, to understand what factor affects the activity of CD11c\u207a cells in the tumors after HSCT, we analyzed the expression of various cytokines\/chemokines with mouse cytokine Ab arrays, and noticed that VEGF-D concentration was increased in the tumors in the early period after HSCT. The CD11c\u207a cells produced IL-6 in response to VEGF-D stimulation, and an administration of VEGF receptor-3 neutralizing Ab significantly suppressed the production of IL-6 from CD11c\u207a cells accompanied with the increase of Tregs in the tumors of HSCT recipients. Autologous HSCT creates an environment that strongly supports the enhancement of antitumor immunity in reconstituted lymphopenic recipients through the suppression of Tregs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Takeshi Udagawa","Kenta Narumi","Koji Suzuki","Kouichirou Aida","Reina Miyakawa","Yoshinori Ikarashi","Atsushi Makimoto","Tatsuya Chikaraishi","Teruhiko Yoshida","Kazunori Aoki"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1201454","first_seen_on":"2013-08-27T20:51:12+00:00","issns":["1550-6606"],"journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1377636653,"links":["http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/early\/2013\/08\/21\/jimmunol.1201454.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/early\/2013\/08\/21\/jimmunol.1201454.full.pdf","pmid":"23966628","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-D\u2013Mediated Blockade of Regulatory T Cells within Tumors Is Induced by Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vascular-endothelial-growth-factordmediated-blockade-regulatory-t-cells-within-tumors-induced-hemato"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":6057751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1078456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131873,"mean":7.0515020929388,"rank":84590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":24503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131873,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7271,"mean":2.7047675378267,"rank":5389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":1143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7271,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":5.016253968254,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
