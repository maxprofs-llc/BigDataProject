Transposable elements (TE) are an important source of mutations in organisms. Their capacity to transpose within a genome, sometimes at a high rate, and their copy number regulation are environment-sensitive, as are the epigenetic pathways that mediate TE regulation in a genome. In this review we revisit the way we see evolvability with regard to transposable elements and epigenetics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f6100039c4","authors":["Marie Fablet","Cristina Vieira"],"doi":"10.1515\/bmc.2011.035","first_seen_on":"2013-08-27T19:36:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1868-5021","1868-503X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Biomolecular Concepts","last_mentioned_on":1373933100,"links":["http:\/\/www.degruyter.com\/view\/j\/bmc.2011.2.issue-5\/bmc.2011.035\/bmc.2011.035.xml"],"pmid":"25962041","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Evolvability, epigenetics and transposable elements","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolvability-epigenetics-transposable-elements"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685046,"mean":4.9228975163162,"rank":614148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3055297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685046,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88889,"mean":7.5678521060211,"rank":18150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":70475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88889,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.5420465116279,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":8.608,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
