Here we describe a new syndrome featuring severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM syndrome) caused by homozygous mutations in DSG1. DSG1 encodes desmoglein 1, a major constituent of desmosomes, which connect the cell surface to the keratin cytoskeleton and have a crucial role in maintaining epidermal integrity and barrier function. Mutations causing SAM syndrome resulted in lack of membrane expression of DSG1, leading to loss of cell-cell adhesion. In addition, DSG1 deficiency was associated with increased expression of a number of genes encoding allergy-related cytokines. Our deciphering of the pathogenesis of SAM syndrome substantiates the notion that allergy may result from a primary structural epidermal defect.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003164","authors":["Liat Samuelov","Ofer Sarig","Robert M Harmon","Debora Rapaport","Akemi Ishida-Yamamoto","Ofer Isakov","Jennifer L Koetsier","Andrea Gat","Ilan Goldberg","Reuven Bergman","Ronen Spiegel","Ori Eytan","Shamir Geller","Sarit Peleg","Noam Shomron","Christabelle S M Goh","Neil J Wilson","Frances J D Smith","Elizabeth Pohler","Michael A Simpson","W H Irwin McLean","Alan D Irvine","Mia Horowitz","John A McGrath","Kathleen J Green","Eli Sprecher","Samuelov L","Sarig O","Harmon RM","Rapaport D","Ishida-Yamamoto A","Isakov O","Koetsier JL","Gat A","Goldberg I","Bergman R","Spiegel R","Eytan O","Geller S","Peleg S","Shomron N","Goh CS","Wilson NJ","Smith FJ","Pohler E","Simpson MA","McLean WH","Irvine AD","Horowitz M","McGrath JA","Green KJ","Sprecher E"],"doi":"10.1038\/ng.2739","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-08-26T15:21:55+00:00","funders":["wellcome","mrc","niams","nci"],"issns":["1061-4036","1546-1718"],"journal":"Nature Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1401444973,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ng\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/ng.2739.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ng.2739","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3791825\/"],"pmid":"23974871","pubdate":"2013-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Diseases","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Medical genetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Desmoglein 1 deficiency results in severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/desmoglein-1-deficiency-results-severe-dermatitis-multiple-allergies-metabolic-wasting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":46,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":46},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059414,"mean":6.8395785174396,"rank":188577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7870582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059414,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132039,"mean":7.116981959739,"rank":3783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":128247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132039,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4494,"mean":25.446216336523,"rank":618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4494,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":58.289493670886,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
