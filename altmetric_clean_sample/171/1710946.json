An individual's self-awareness of functional impairment may be a significant factor contributing to long-term disability. In fact, subjective interpretation of one's illness impacts treatment participation and adherence, and is linked to poor outcomes. However, it remains unclear how illness-related functional impairment is perceived by individuals prior to the onset of psychosis. This study aims to examine the relationship between clinician-based and self-report assessments of functioning, as well as the contribution of clinical symptoms to this relationship in individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003bb9","authors":["Olvet, Doreen M.","Carri\u00f3n, Ricardo E.","Auther, Andrea M.","Cornblatt, Barbara A.","Doreen M.
