On the basis of the role that bio-reducing agents may play on the mode of action of ruthenium-based anticancer drugs, we performed detailed kinetic studies on the reaction of ascorbic acid and glutathione with the [Ru2(RCOO)4](+) paddlewheel framework by using the non-drug, diaqua complex ion [Ru2(CH3COO)4(H2O)2](+). In the presence of the reducing agents, the diaqua-Ru2 species first undergo a ligand substitution reaction by which the axially-coordinated water is displaced by the reducing agent. In both cases, this reaction is followed by an intra-molecular electron transfer process during which the metal-metal center is reduced from Ru2(5+) to Ru2(4+) and the reducing agent is oxidized. Product analyses were performed with the application of ESI-MS and (1)H-NMR techniques. Rate and activation parameters are reported for the different reaction steps.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Rudi Van Eldik","Rodrigo Luis Silva Ribeiro Santos","Denise De Oliveira Silva","Rudi van Eldik","Denise de Oliveira Silva"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3dt51763b","first_seen_on":"2013-08-29T15:39:37+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"48","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1384995047,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/C3DT51763B","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/C3DT51763B?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/dt\/c3dt51763b","pmid":"24081178","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"16796","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Kinetic and mechanistic studies on reactions of diruthenium(II,III) with biologically relevant reducing agents","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kinetic-mechanistic-studies-reactions-dirutheniumiiiii-biologically-relevant-reducing-agents-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230816,"mean":5.9681227261619,"rank":5295542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230816,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103405,"mean":7.9661860469615,"rank":85533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103405,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9795,"mean":0.64311415152134,"rank":2700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9795,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.909375,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
