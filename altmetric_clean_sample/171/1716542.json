To better understand these interactions, we have defined the roles of tyramine (TA), octopamine, and neuropeptides in the inhibition of aversive behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans. TA abolishes the serotonergic sensitization of aversive behavior mediated by the two nociceptive ASH sensory neurons and requires the expression of the adrenergic-like, G\u03b1q-coupled, TA receptor TYRA-3 on inhibitory monoaminergic and peptidergic neurons. For example, TA inhibition requires G\u03b1q and G\u03b1s signaling in the peptidergic ASI sensory neurons, with an array of ASI neuropeptides activating neuropeptide receptors on additional neurons involved in locomotory decision-making. The ASI neuropeptides required for tyraminergic inhibition are distinct from those required for octopaminergic inhibition, suggesting that individual monoamines stimulate the release of different subsets of ASI neuropeptides. Together, these results demonstrate that a complex humoral mix of monoamines is focused by more local, synaptic, neuropeptide release to modulate nociception and highlight the similarities between the tyraminergic\/octopaminergic inhibition of nociception in C. elegans and the noradrenergic inhibition of nociception in mammals that also involves inhibitory peptidergic signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Vera Hapiak","Philip Summers","Amanda Ortega","Wen Jing Law","Andrew Stein","Richard Komuniecki"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.1324-13.2013","first_seen_on":"2013-08-28T20:25:45+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"35","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1377874743,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/35\/14107.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/35\/14107.full.pdf","pmid":"23986246","pubdate":"2013-08-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"14107","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Neuropeptides Amplify and Focus the Monoaminergic Inhibition of Nociception in Caenorhabditis elegans","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuropeptides-amplify-focus-monoaminergic-inhibition-nociception-caenorhabditis-elegans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1785944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2639534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93588,"mean":7.7745124857087,"rank":33329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":58265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93588,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10243,"mean":6.6512216363992,"rank":4663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":5337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10243,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":328,"mean":14.612201834862,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":328,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
