The study involves 148 ambulatory patients who were given the drug twice daily in the morning and at midday, for a period varying from 1 to 3 months. The following informations were noted; the symptoms; the aspect of the mucous membrane; associated diseases, if any; predisposing factors; hygienic and alimentary habits. Global results: 46,5% good and very good results; 32,5% quite good results; 21% no result. The authors considered as good and very good the cases in which they noted both an objective aspect of the mucous membrane and a subjective improvement, the results were considered when the improvement was only objective. No intolerance or side effects were noted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9183cf058f61000d1c1","first_seen_on":"2013-08-26T16:08:28+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"21-24","journal":"La semaine des h\u00f4pitaux : organe fond\u00e9 par l'Association d'enseignement m\u00e9dical des h\u00f4pitaux de Paris","last_mentioned_on":1377531396,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/6267714\/"],"pmid":"6267714","title":"[The use of manganese-copper-oligosol in the treatment of chronic pharyngitis (author's transl)].","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/manganesecopperoligosol-treatment-chronic-pharyngitis-authors-transl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229091,"mean":5.9655632456766,"rank":2926306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229091,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104013,"mean":7.9084103949545,"rank":51481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":38306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104013,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.4166666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rachelmarsden\/status\/372019755936272384","license":"public","citation_ids":[1710986],"posted_on":"2013-08-26T15:36:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Rachel Marsden","url":"http:\/\/www.rachelmarsden.com","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3003054865\/bb57c08bad5a8bc5620078d9f3ffac29_normal.jpeg","description":"CEO Rachel Marsden Associates, global strategic communications and (geo)political advisory firm.
