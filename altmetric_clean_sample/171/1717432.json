By contrast, many dyes and antibodies exist for the immuno-labelling of fixed tissue. Here we report a method that combines the advantages of histochemistry and in vivo imaging by correlating cryosection labelling with corresponding intravital microscopy images (CLIM). Using CLIM, we find that the presence of CD3(+) T cells correlates with mammary tumour cell migration. When CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subsets are depleted, reduced tumour cell migration is observed. From these data we conclude that CLIM is a powerful tool to correlate intravital microscopy data with cryosection labelling data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Laila Ritsma","Nienke Vrisekoop","Jacco van Rheenen"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms3366","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-08-29T07:33:35+00:00","issns":["2041-1733"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1377761519,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2013\/130827\/ncomms3366\/full\/ncomms3366.html?WT.ec_id=NCOMMS-20130828"],"pmid":"23978961","pubdate":"2013-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"","title":"In vivo imaging and histochemistry are combined in the cryosection labelling and intravital microscopy technique","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vivo-imaging-histochemistry-combined-cryosection-labelling-intravital-microscopy-technique"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228985,"mean":5.9651782765876,"rank":2389116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3768056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228985,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103389,"mean":7.9656190466979,"rank":39208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":62570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103389,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9705,"mean":37.683324196208,"rank":7098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":2542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9705,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322,"mean":35.064847352025,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
