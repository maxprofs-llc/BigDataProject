In the present study we examined the importance of the greater incremental glucose and insulin concentrations on glycogen repletion by comparing intake of large carbohydrate meals (\"gorging\") with a pattern of frequent, small, carbohydrate snacks (\"nibbling\"), which simulates the flattened glucose and insulin responses after low-GI carbohydrate meals. Eight well-trained triathletes [x +\/- SEM: 25.6 +\/- 1.5 y of age, weighing 70.2 +\/- 1.9 kg, and with a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) of 4.2 +\/- 0.2 L\/min] undertook an exercise trial (2 h at 75% VO2max followed by four 30-s sprints) to deplete muscle glycogen on two occasions, 1 wk apart For 24 h after each trial, subjects rested and consumed the same diet composed exclusively of high-GI carbohydrate foods, providing 10 g carbohydrate\/kg body mass. The \"gorging\" trial provided the food as four large meals of equal carbohydrate content eaten at 0, 4, 8, and 20 h of recovery, whereas in the \"nibbling\" trial each of the meals was divided into four snacks and fed at hourly intervals (0-11, 20-23 h). However, there was no significant difference in muscle glycogen storage between the two groups over the 24 h (gorging: 74.1 +\/- 8.0 mmol\/kg wet wt; nibbling: 94.5 +\/- 14.6 mmol\/kg wet wt). The results of this study suggest that there is no difference in postexercise glycogen storage over 24 h when a high-carbohydrate diet is fed as small frequent snacks or as large meals, and that a mechanism other than lowered blood glucose and insulin concentrations needs to be sought to explain the reduced rate of glycogen storage after consumption of low-GI carbohydrate foods.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["Burke, L M","Collier, G R","Davis, P G","Fricker, P A","Sanigorski, A J","Hargreaves, M"],"first_seen_on":"2013-08-28T18:33:40+00:00","issns":["0002-9165","1938-3207"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1438848464,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8669406","http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/64\/1\/115.short"],"pmid":"8669406","pubdate":"1996-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Muscle glycogen storage after prolonged exercise: effect of the frequency of carbohydrate feedings.","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/muscle-glycogen-storage-after-prolonged-exercise-effect-frequency-carbohydrate-feedings-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5450695,"mean":6.347149723687,"rank":2707254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2579199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5450695,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101177,"mean":7.992626314541,"rank":46492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":51474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101177,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5162,"mean":20.012885487309,"rank":3819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5162,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":7.7716666666667,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
