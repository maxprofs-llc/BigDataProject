The majority of World War II (WWII) veterans and Holocaust survivors still define their war experiences as being the \"most significant stressor\" of their lives. Aging of survivors is frequently associated with depression, reactivation of traumatic syndromes, physical disorders, loss, and psychological distress, possibly increasing the risk of suicide. The aim of the present study was to investigate, among a large cohort of elderly Holocaust survivors, whether their WWII experiences confer an increased risk of suicidal behavior.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006978","authors":["Barak Y","Aizenberg D","Szor H","Swartz M","Maor R","Knobler HY","Y.
