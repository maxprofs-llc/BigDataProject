It shows how a variety of studies of Fascist psychopathology, centered on the concept of superego, were mobilized in military intelligence, postwar planning and policy recommendations for \"denazification.\" Freud's ideas were sometimes championed by particular army doctors and government planners; at other times they were combined with, or displaced by, competing, psychiatric and psychological forms of treatment and diverse studies of the Fascist \"personality.\" This is illustrated through a discussion of the treatment and interpretation of the deputy leader of the Nazi Party, Rudolf Hess, after his arrival in Britain in 1941.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001ebd","authors":["Daniel Pick"],"first_seen_on":"2013-08-26T20:51:27+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Psychoanalysis & History","last_mentioned_on":1379147487,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3748372\/?report=classic"],"pmid":"19791314","pubdate":"2013-08-26T20:09:00+00:00","publisher":"Europe PMC Funders","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Historical Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"137","title":"\u2018IN PURSUIT OF THE NAZI MIND?\u2019 THE DEPLOYMENT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS IN THE ALLIED STRUGGLE AGAINST GERMANY","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pursuit-nazi-mind-deployment-psychoanalysis-allied-struggle-against-germany"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631967,"mean":4.9253635474614,"rank":2740551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":733664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631967,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88283,"mean":7.5762926757439,"rank":65994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88283,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.2323529411765,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
