There is a paucity of research on how consultants deal with their new supervisory roles and which factors influence this process. These issues are addressed in a prospective study designed to gather insights that can inform measures to ensure the provision of high-quality supervision and specialty training.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003094","authors":["Westerman, Michiel","Teunissen, Pim W","Fokkema, Joanne P I","Siegert, Carl E H","van der Vleuten, Cees P M","Scherpbier, Albert J J A","Scheele, Fedde"],"doi":"10.1111\/medu.12129","endpage":"416","first_seen_on":"2013-08-27T12:52:04+00:00","issns":["1365-2923","0308-0110"],"issue":"4","journal":"Medical Education","last_mentioned_on":1415231471,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/medu.12129\/abstract;jsessionid=2F58C501F494E38653FD2A72DCC4AA86.d02t02","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23488760\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/medu.12129\/pdf","pmid":"23488760","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"408","subjects":["education"],"title":"New consultants mastering the role of on-call supervisor: a longitudinal qualitative study.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-consultants-mastering-role-oncall-supervisor-longitudinal-qualitative-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6291064,"mean":5.9790049322357,"rank":2315721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3884414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6291064,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104690,"mean":7.9186155947617,"rank":37633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":65212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104690,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":728,"mean":4.17584869326,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":728,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.8,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
