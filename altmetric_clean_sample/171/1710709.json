The biochemical characterization of the underlying biological sensors combined with advances in polymer chemistry has enabled the development of stimulus-sensitive biohybrid materials that translate most diverse chemical and biological input into a precise change in material properties. In this review article, we first describe synthesis strategies of how biological and chemical polymers can functionally be interconnected. We then provide a comprehensive overview of how the different properties of biological sensor molecules such as competitive target binding and allosteric modulation can be harnessed to develop responsive materials with applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008096","authors":["Hotz, Natascha","Wilcke, Louisa","Weber, Wilfried"],"doi":"10.1002\/marc.201300468","endpage":"1610","first_seen_on":"2013-08-26T12:21:52+00:00","issns":["1521-3927","1022-1336"],"issue":"20","journal":"Macromolecular Rapid Communications","last_mentioned_on":1378054671,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201300468\/abstract;jsessionid=925CC852CCCD9C5CE8FC969DDEF9BD11.d04t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201300468\/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201300468\/pdf","pmid":"23982955","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"1594","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Design, Synthesis, and Application of Stimulus\u00e2\u0080\u0090Sensing Biohybrid Hydrogels","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-synthesis-application-stimulussensing-biohybrid-hydrogels"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6330725,"mean":5.9768190153299,"rank":2978377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1894086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6330725,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105445,"mean":7.8501921399037,"rank":51995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":38997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105445,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":766,"mean":1.7613960784314,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":766,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.53571428571429,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
