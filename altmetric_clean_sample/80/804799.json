However, noise reduction programmes aimed at leisure activities (such as music listening) face a unique difficulty. The noise source that is earmarked for reduction by hearing health professionals is often the same one that is viewed as pleasurable by participants. Furthermore, these activities often exist within a social setting, with additional peer influences that may influence behavior. The current study aimed to gain a better understanding of social-based factors that may influence an individual's motivation to engage in positive hearing health behaviors. Four hundred and eighty-four participants completed questionnaires examining their perceptions of the hearing risk associated with listening to music listening and asking for estimates of their own and their peer's music listening behaviors. Participants were generally aware of the potential risk posed by listening to personal stereo players (PSPs) and the volumes likely to be most dangerous. Approximately one in five participants reported using listening volumes at levels perceived to be dangerous, an incidence rate in keeping with other studies measuring actual PSP use. However, participants showed less awareness of peers' behavior, consistently overestimating the volumes at which they believed their friends listened. Misperceptions of social norms relating to listening behavior may decrease individuals' perceptions of susceptibility to hearing damage. The consequences of hearing health promotion are discussed, along with suggestions relating to the development of new programs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f6100042a0","authors":["Gilliver","Megan Gilliver","Denise Macoun","Jenny Rosen","Warwick Williams","Lyndal Carter"],"doi":"10.4103\/1463-1741.95131","first_seen_on":"2012-06-22T17:10:11+00:00","issns":["1463-1741"],"issue":"57","journal":"Noise & Health","last_mentioned_on":1340404037,"links":["http:\/\/www.noiseandhealth.org\/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2012;volume=14;issue=57;spage=47;epage=51;aulast=Gilliver"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.noiseandhealth.org\/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2012;volume=14;issue=57;spage=47;epage=51;aulast=Gilliver;type=2","pmid":"22517303","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["audiology"],"title":"Music to whose ears?
