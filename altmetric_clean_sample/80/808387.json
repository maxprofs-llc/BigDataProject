The survey was undertaken to explain an apparent gap between reports of the number of condoms distributed in certain areas compared with prevalence of users as reported in contraceptive prevalence surveys. These data are analyzed from behavioral and management perspectives to identify various factors influencing utilization, with potential implications for understanding and improving family planning and AIDS\/STD prevention service systems. Patterns of use are related to differences in source of supply through public, free or private-priced systems, differences in urban or semi-rural place of residence, and differences in perceptions of men or women. The problem with condom use most often identified by the respondents was breakage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000376a","authors":["Ahmed, G","Liner, E C","Williamson, N E","Schellstede, W P"],"first_seen_on":"2012-06-25T20:40:22+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0010-7824"],"issue":"5","journal":"Contraception","last_mentioned_on":1340656214,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2272182"],"pmid":"2272182","pubdate":"1990-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Characteristics of condom use and associated problems: experience in Bangladesh.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characteristics-condom-associated-problems-experience-bangladesh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":2687736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":939265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72390,"mean":4.6634039978449,"rank":45837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":26447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72390,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":877,"mean":4.6673401826484,"rank":709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":877,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.7444444444444,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
