However, what constitutes fair benefits, and the exact nature of the benefits and their mode of provision can be strongly contested. Empirical studies have the potential to contribute viewpoints and experiences to debates and guidelines, but few have been conducted. We conducted a study to support the development of guidelines on benefits and payments for studies conducted by the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust programme in Kilifi, Kenya.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c0","authors":["Sassy Molyneux","Sassy Molyneux","Stephen Mulupi","Lairumbi Mbaabu","Vicki Marsh"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6939-13-13","first_seen_on":"2012-06-22T15:03:12+00:00","funders":["wellcome"],"issns":["","1472-6939"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1341828468,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6939\/13\/13\/abstract"],"pmid":"22726531","pubdate":"2012-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"13","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Benefits and payments for research participants: Experiences and views from a research centre on the Kenyan coast","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/benefits-payments-research-participants-experiences-views-research-centre-kenyan-coast"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":813746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":4221379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77828,"mean":5.2784801675511,"rank":11996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":65796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77828,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":306,"mean":7.6743213114754,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":306,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":6.426,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":9}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
