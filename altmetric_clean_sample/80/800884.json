N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has emerged as a candidate biomarker that may enable the early detection of systemic sclerosis-related pulmonary arterial hypertension (SSc-PAH). The objective of our study was to incorporate NT-proBNP into a screening algorithm for SSc-PAH that could potentially replace transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as a more convenient and less costly \"first tier\" test.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a3","authors":["Thakkar V","Stevens WM","Prior D","Moore OA","Byron J","Liew D","Patterson K","Hissaria P","Roddy J","Zochling J","Sahhar J","Nash P","Tymms K","Celermajer D","Gabbay E","Youssef P","Proudman SM","Nikpour M","Vivek Thakkar","Wendy M Stevens","David Prior","Owen A Moore","Jillian Byron","Danny Liew","Karen Patterson","Pravin Hissaria","Janet Roddy","Jane Zochling","Joanne Sahhar","Peter Nash","Kathleen Tymms","David Celermajer","Eli Gabbay","Peter Youssef","Susanna M Proudman","Mandana Nikpour"],"doi":"10.1186\/ar3876","first_seen_on":"2012-06-20T12:36:41+00:00","handle":"1959.7\/537760","handles":["1959.7\/537760","2440\/73620"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1478-6354"],"issue":"3","journal":"Arthritis Research & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1340195661,"links":["http:\/\/arthritis-research.com\/content\/14\/3\/R143\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/ar3876"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/ar3876?site=arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"22691291","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"R143","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"N-terminal pro-Brain natriuretic peptide in a novel screening algorithm for pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic sclerosis: a case control study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/ar3876","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nterminal-probrain-natriuretic-peptide-novel-screening-algorithm-pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-sys"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2306126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1590955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75285,"mean":5.029803650178,"rank":34597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":30295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75285,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1080,"mean":3.288422613531,"rank":565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1080,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.238,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
