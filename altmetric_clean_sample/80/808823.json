Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify and characterize the neural substrates that support unprompted auditory imagery and find that auditory and visual imagery seem to obey similar basic neural principles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2005Natur.434..158K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["David J.
