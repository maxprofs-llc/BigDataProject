This study investigated the differential impact of some demographic, socioeconomic, environmental and health-related factors on the nutritional status among under-five children in Bangladesh using Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2007 data. Two-level random intercept binary logistic regression models were used to identify the determinants of under-five malnutrition. The analyses revealed that 16% of the children were severely stunted and 25% were moderately stunted. Among the children under five years of age 3% were severely wasted and 14% were moderately wasted. Furthermore, 11% of the children were severely underweight and 28% were moderately underweight. The main contributing factors for under-five malnutrition were found to be child's age, mother's education, father's education, father's occupation, family wealth index, currently breast-feeding, place of delivery and division. Significant community-level variations were found in the analyses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001cbb","doi":"10.1017\/s0021932012000181","first_seen_on":"2012-06-22T10:09:04+00:00","issns":["1469-7599"],"journal":"Journal of Biosocial Science","last_mentioned_on":1355173083,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22716955?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22716955","pubdate":"2012-04-24T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF UNDER-FIVE CHILDREN IN BANGLADESH: A MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutritional-status-underfive-children-bangladesh-multilevel-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":2898269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72506,"mean":4.6274324253499,"rank":52910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72506,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165,"mean":3.1724756097561,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.5,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
