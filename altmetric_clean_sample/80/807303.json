The role of knowledge \"stickiness\" in the reduction of knowledge transfer is outlined. The characteristics of the knowledge and the situation combine to develop a range of factors, \"stickiness predictors,\" which can deter knowledge transfer. These stickiness predictors are used to analyse data gathered from three qualitative cases, which were developed from both participant observation and semi-structured interviews studying the interactions between the scientists, volunteers and organisations. A reconsideration of the way that knowledge and knowledge transfer are being conceptualised by scientists is proposed, in order to enable \"stickiness\" factors to be recognised and managed, thereby increasing the potential for scientific literacy. A move towards a more broadly constituted community of practice is proposed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6023cf058f6100063bc","authors":["Benson, Angela M.","Blackman D","Benson AM","Deborah Blackman","Angela M.
