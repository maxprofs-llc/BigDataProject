Seventy-one university students with a negative concussion history completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory (BC-PSI). A multiple regression was conducted using the three DASS subscale scores as predictors of postconcussion-like symptoms. Depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress were significantly positively correlated with postconcussion-like symptoms at the bivariate level. When these three factors were examined together 72.9% of variance in BC-PSI total scores was explained overall. Stress and depressive symptoms emerged as significant multivariate predictors explaining 15% and 3% of unique variance, respectively. Anxiety was not a significant multivariate predictor. These results suggest that stress may be a more important predictor of postconcussion-like symptoms than previously identified. Findings are interpreted in light of Iverson (2012) conceptual model of poor outcomes from mild traumatic brain injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Edmed S","Sullivan K","Shannon Edmed","Karen Sullivan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.psychres.2012.05.022","endpage":"45","first_seen_on":"2012-06-20T16:18:14+00:00","issns":["0165-1781","01651781"],"issue":"1","journal":"Psychiatry Research","last_mentioned_on":1340209220,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22709538?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22709538","pubdate":"2012-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"41","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Depression, anxiety, and stress as predictors of postconcussion-like symptoms in a non-clinical sample.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0165178112002971","volume":"200","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depression-anxiety-stress-predictors-postconcussionlike-symptoms-nonclinical-sample"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211580,"mean":6.3510655461134,"rank":5172540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1783503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211580,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90836,"mean":5.4178703583421,"rank":54974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":31924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90836,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3381,"mean":4.3065106508876,"rank":2298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3381,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":3.0201884057971,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
