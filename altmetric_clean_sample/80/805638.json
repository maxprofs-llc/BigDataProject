We assessed construct validity by interviewing 254 consecutive dermatology patients at Stanford Medical Center, Grady Hospital, and Parkland Hospital. Instruments asked about an individual's own health status and elicited WTP, time-trade-off (TTO) utilities, and health status quality of life (QOL). We measured WTP cure (short treatment course to eliminate disease) and WTP control (lifelong medication). Our data indicate greater construct validity in non-Medicaid (n=163) than Medicaid (n=91) patients. Non-Medicaid subjects had greater WTP as percent of income for cure (median: 2%) than control (median: 1.6%), P<0.01; Medicaid WTP amounts for control and cure did not differ. Non-Medicaid subjects with verrucae had little QOL impact, no measurable burden by TTO, and a correspondingly low WTP. Medicaid subjects with basal cell carcinoma had a strong, negative QOL impact and high burden by TTO, but had relatively moderate WTP. WTP appears promising in certain income categories. More studies are needed for conclusions about specific diagnoses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e0e","authors":["Anne M Seidler","Ahmed M Bayoumi","Mary K Goldstein","Ponciano D Cruz","Suephy C Chen"],"doi":"10.1038\/jid.2012.50","endpage":"1790","first_seen_on":"2012-06-23T08:31:11+00:00","funders":["niams"],"issns":["0022-202X"," 1523-1747"],"journal":"Journal of Investigative Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1340388064,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/jid\/journal\/v132\/n7\/full\/jid201250a.html?WT.mc_id=FBK_JID"],"pmid":"22418874","pubdate":"2012-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1785","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Willingness to Pay in Dermatology: Assessment of the Burden of Skin Diseases","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/willingness-pay-dermatology-assessment-burden-skin-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3063630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75414,"mean":5.0397037380823,"rank":48313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":14567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75414,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2426,"mean":4.5347579381443,"rank":1853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2426,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":1.8890588235294,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
