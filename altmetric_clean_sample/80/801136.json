The samples were prepared slightly below the melting volume fraction of the polymer free system. For the polymer free samples, we obtained polycrystalline solids via crystallization scenario known from hard sphere suspensions with little competition of wall crystal formation. Addition of non-adsorbing low molecular weight polystyrene polymer leads to a considerably slowing down of the bulk crystallization kinetics. We observed a delay of the precursor to crystal conversion for the bulk crystallization while the induction times for the wall nucleation are reduced. The increased polymer concentration thus shifts the balance between the two competing crystallization pathways giving the possibility to tune the relative amount of wall based crystals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012JChPh.136w4906B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":[" Sch\u00f6pe, Hans Joachim","Beyer, Richard","Iacopini, Sara","Palberg, Thomas"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4729562","first_seen_on":"2012-06-20T15:27:22+00:00","issns":["00219606","0021-9606","1089-7690"],"issue":"23","journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1340199253,"links":["http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/resource\/1\/jcpsa6\/v136\/i23\/p234906_s1","http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/resource\/1\/jcpsa6\/v136\/i23\/p234906_s1?isAuthorized=no"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aip.org\/link\/?JCPSA6\/136\/234906\/1\/pdf","pmid":"22779618","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Institute of Physics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Polymer induced changes of the crystallization scenario in suspensions of hard sphere like microgel particles","type":"article","volume":"136","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymer-induced-changes-crystallization-scenario-suspensions-hard-sphere-like-microgel-particles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":2016302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72383,"mean":4.6314352463319,"rank":33351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":26615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72383,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3048,"mean":2.0641713160486,"rank":1187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3048,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.826,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
