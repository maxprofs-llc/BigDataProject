These nuclear effectors functioned in a context-specific fashion on transcriptome, depending on breast-cancer aggressiveness and methylation state. Wwox and E-cadherin were found in human specimens of bone metastasis but not in primary-ductal breast carcinoma, while TAZ showed a characteristic localisation in metastasis nuclei. Wwox and E-cadherin were higher in 1833-metastatic clone with bone avidity than in parental-MDA-MB231 cells, while only metastatic cells presented TAZ. In 1833 cells, a complex interplay of transcriptional signalling controlled E-cadherin transactivation. Wwox and TAZ activated Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) binding to E-cadherin promoter, while Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) intervened in E-cadherin transactivation favouring and preventing Wwox and TAZ functions, respectively. Methylation impinged on Hippo-related pathways through Wwox and TAZ, modifying metastatic phenotype. The protract exposure to 5-azacytidine (Aza), by affecting methylation state modified the shape of 1833 cells, becoming mesenchymal as that of MDA-MB231 cells and reduced spontaneous-Matrigel invasion. The underlying-molecular mechanisms were diminutions of E-cadherin, Wwox, matrix metalloproteases 2 and 9, HIF-1- and PPAR\u03b3-activities, inversely correlated to Snail and nuclear-TAZ accumulations. Exogenous WWOX restored 1833-Aza invasion. Thus, 1833-Aza cells permitted to study the role played by methylation in metastasis plasticity, being E-cadherin loss part of an entire-gene reprogramming. Of note, bone-metastasis formation in 1833-Aza xenograft was partially impaired, prolonging mice survival. In conclusion, the methylation-heritable changes seemed important for cancer progression to establish bone metastasis engraftment\/growth, by affecting steps requiring homotipic and\/or heterotypic-adhesive properties and matrix degradation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e9a","authors":["Desiderio, Maria Alfonsina","Emanuela Matteucci","Paola Maroni","Alessandro Luzzati","Giuseppe Perrucchini","Paola Bendinelli","Maria Alfonsina Desiderio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejca.2012.05.006","first_seen_on":"2012-06-20T14:51:32+00:00","issns":["0959-8049","09598049"],"journal":"European Journal of Cancer (1965)","last_mentioned_on":1489661009,"links":["http:\/\/www.ejcancer.info\/article\/PIIS0959804912004042\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_content=cancer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitter.com%2Fcancer_buzz&utm_term=cancer","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ejca.2012.05.006"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ejcancer.info\/article\/S0959-8049(12)00404-2\/pdf","pmid":"22717556","pubdate":"2012-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Bone metastatic process of breast cancer involves methylation state affecting E-cadherin expression through TAZ and WWOX nuclear effectors","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0959804912004042","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bone-metastatic-process-breast-cancer-involves-methylation-state-affecting-ecadherin-expression-thro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":3968613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4211814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94847,"mean":5.8544542310693,"rank":39197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":52874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94847,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2060,"mean":5.04355026712,"rank":1165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2060,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.4322580645161,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
