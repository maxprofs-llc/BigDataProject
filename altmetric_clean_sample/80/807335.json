In adults, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the most prevalent phyla. Experimental data in animal and observational studies in obese patients suggest that obesity is associated with substantial changes in the composition and metabolic function of the gut microbiota. The initial findings linked obesity with the decreased relative proportion of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes. There are some authors who suggest that probiotics and prebiotics can modulate obesity-host metabolism in obesity and obesity-related disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000712f","authors":["Krznari\u0107 Z","Vrane\u0161i\u0107 Bender D","Kunovi\u0107 A","Kekez D","Stimac D"],"doi":"10.1159\/000336965","first_seen_on":"2012-06-25T02:52:55+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Digestive Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1340592769,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22722438"],"pmid":"22722438","pubdate":"2012-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Gut microbiota and obesity.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gut-microbiota-obesity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2981096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1396134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75308,"mean":4.9926240588524,"rank":46838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":26139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75308,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222,"mean":1.8433574660633,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.0861111111111,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
