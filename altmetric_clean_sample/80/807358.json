The distribution of these isoforms of PPAR\u03b3 transcripts in different tissues (ovary, mammary gland, spleen, liver, lung, adipose tissue) was investigated using quantitative real time analysis. Tissue- and transcript-specific expression analyses showed that a transcript, transcribed from distal promoter, not only expressed preferentially in ovary but contributes predominantly to PPAR gamma expression in ovary. Western blot analysis of both, in vivo and in vitro, experiments also supported that PPAR\u03b31 predominantly expressed in ovary. In buffalo granulosa cells culture, the isolated transcripts were found to be up-regulated by both natural (CLA) and synthetic (Rosiglitazone) ligands and effect was reversed by PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662. In conclusion, the present study identified an ovary-specific novel transcript, transcribed by distal promoter, predominantly expressed in ovary which could have functional relevance in buffalo ovary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["Sharma I","Monga R","Singh N","Datta TK","Singh D"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gene.2012.04.090","first_seen_on":"2012-06-25T04:09:26+00:00","issns":["0378-1119","03781119"],"journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":1340597349,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378111912005604"],"pmid":"22609729","pubdate":"2012-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Ovary-specific novel peroxisome proliferator activated receptors-gamma transcripts in buffalo ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ovaryspecific-novel-peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptorsgamma-transcripts-buffalo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":988167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75309,"mean":5.0031623466298,"rank":48957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":18404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75309,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991,"mean":2.049101754386,"rank":2616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.28815,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
