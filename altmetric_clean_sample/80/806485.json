Beyond a simple antihypertensive effect, ACEIs have been shown to reduce the rates of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and new-onset heart failure, and appear to have a 'blood pressure independent' effect. Given the shared mechanism of preventing action of angiotensin II, the effects of ARB therapy on reduction in cardiovascular and renal outcomes were anticipated to be equal to that of ACEI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000585d","doi":"10.1097\/hco.0b013e328353bc68","first_seen_on":"2012-06-24T04:54:22+00:00","issns":["0268-4705"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current opinion in cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1340513612,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-cardiology\/Abstract\/2012\/07000\/Do_angiotensin_receptor_blockers_prevent.11.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-cardiology\/2012\/07000\/Do_angiotensin_receptor_blockers_prevent.11.pdf","pmid":"22525329","pubdate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"381","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Do angiotensin receptor blockers prevent myocardial infarctions as well as other initial therapies?","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/angiotensin-receptor-blockers-prevent-myocardial-infarctions-other-initial-therapies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3063469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":942904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75675,"mean":5.0452972751539,"rank":48417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":14539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75675,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":661,"mean":1.1793787878788,"rank":262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":661,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.52941176470588,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
