However, it is often not possible to precisely modify selected properties without changing other parameters. To overcome these difficulties, well-defined poly(pentafluorostyrene)-based polymers are prepared that can be grafted via thiol\/para-fluorine \"click\" reaction with 1-thio-\u03b2-D-glucose and 1-thio-\u03b2-D-galactose. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry show that nanoparticles are taken up by HepG2 cells to a higher degree than the respective water-soluble polymers, and that internalization of both galactosylated homo- and nanoprecipitated block copolymers is enhanced.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008093","authors":["Babiuch, Krzysztof","Pretzel, David","Tolstik, Tatiana","Vollrath, Antje","Stanca, Sarmiza","Foertsch, Franziska","Becer, C.
