The Sharpe-Schoolfield-Ikemoto (SSI) model succeeded in defining the temperature that can thermodynamically meet the condition that at a particular temperature the probability of an active enzyme reaching its maximum activity is realized. Previously, an algorithm was developed by Ikemoto (Tropical malaria does not mean hot environments. Journal of Medical Entomology, 45, 963-969) to estimate model parameters, but that program was computationally very time consuming. Now, investigators can use the SSI model more easily because a full automatic computer program was designed by Shi et al. (A modified program for estimating the parameters of the SSI model. Environmental Entomology, 40, 462-469). However, the statistical significance of the point estimate of the intrinsic optimum temperature for each ectotherm has not yet been determined. Here, we provided a new method for calculating the confidence interval of the estimated intrinsic optimum temperature by modifying the approximate bootstrap confidence intervals method. For this purpose, it was necessary to develop a new program for a faster estimation of the parameters in the SSI model, which we have also done.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5273cf058f610003dc0","authors":["Ikemoto, Takaya","Kurahashi, Issei","Shi, Pei\u2010Jian"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1744-7917.2012.01525.x","endpage":"428","first_seen_on":"2012-06-22T08:12:50+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1744-7917","1672-9609"],"issue":"3","journal":"Insect Science","last_mentioned_on":1340339457,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1744-7917.2012.01525.x\/abstract;jsessionid=E52D5DF7D38B6D45F92865297891D4E5.d03t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1744-7917.2012.01525.x\/pdf","pmid":"23955893","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Asia","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecological Applications","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"420","title":"Confidence interval of intrinsic optimum temperature estimated using thermodynamic SSI model","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/confidence-interval-intrinsic-optimum-temperature-estimated-using-thermodynamic-ssi-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7545615,"mean":6.5165964444999,"rank":3897052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2111751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7545615,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92026,"mean":5.497128801956,"rank":43630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":36181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92026,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259,"mean":2.556488372093,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":4.1666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
