Initially this therapeutic benefit was attributed to the correction of zinc deficiency in malnourished individuals, but recently evidence has emerged that zinc significantly impacts the pathogens themselves: zinc concentrations achievable by oral supplementation can reduce the expression of key virulence-related genes in EPEC and related organisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c8","authors":["Mellies JL","Thomas K","Turvey M","Evans NR","Crane J","Boedeker E","Benison GC","Jay L Mellies","Katherine Thomas","Michael Turvey","Neil R Evans","John Crane","Ed Boedeker","Gregory C Benison"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2180-12-123","first_seen_on":"2012-06-24T22:25:37+00:00","funders":["niaid","niehs"],"issns":["","1471-2180"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1340702281,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/12\/123\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22727253"],"pmid":"22727253","pubdate":"2012-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"123","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Zinc-induced envelope stress diminishes type III secretion in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2180-12-123","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zincinduced-envelope-stress-diminishes-type-iii-secretion-enteropathogenic-escherichia-coli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4680920,"mean":5.6987154988182,"rank":1917430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2740102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4680920,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76216,"mean":5.2490782916748,"rank":24446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":51325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76216,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":939,"mean":2.7439509594883,"rank":322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":939,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":2.1739574468085,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
