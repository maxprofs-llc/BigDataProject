Minimally invasive heart surgery using a limited thoracotomy offers many potential benefits including reduction in blood loss, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery time, decreased pain, and improved cosmesis. Minimally invasive heart surgery often requires access to the second, third, or fourth intercostal space of the anterior chest wall. The presence of a breast implant may interfere with the surgeon's ability to gain adequate exposure for entry to the appropriate intercostal space. We present a case series of 5 women with breast implants who successfully underwent minimally invasive cardiac valve surgery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a2c","doi":"10.1097\/sap.0b013e318221b54b","first_seen_on":"2012-06-21T04:16:11+00:00","issns":["0148-7043"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1340251547,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Abstract\/2012\/07000\/Breast_Implants_and_Minimally_Invasive_Cardiac.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/2012\/07000\/Breast_Implants_and_Minimally_Invasive_Cardiac.3.pdf","pmid":"21659843","pubdate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"10","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Breast Implants and Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery: A Case Series","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/breast-implants-minimally-invasive-cardiac-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4200958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77665,"mean":5.2850873763906,"rank":63711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77665,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1961,"mean":1.039462244898,"rank":1289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1961,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":0.61833333333333,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AnnalsofPlSrgy\/status\/215656738454642689","citation_ids":[802063],"posted_on":"2012-06-21T04:05:47+00:00","author":{"name":"APSOnlineJrl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611398882\/APS_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief: William C.
