It has been noted to have a relatively mild adverse effect profile, with the most common side effects being somnolence, asthenia, infection, and dizziness. Although it has been widely prescribed, there have been few reports on the safety of this agent in overdose.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d06","authors":["Larkin, T.
