We sought to determine the effect of bronchoscopic thermal vapour ablation (BTVA) on lung volumes and outcomes in patients with emphysema. 44 patients with upper lobe-predominant emphysema were treated unilaterally with BTVA. Entry criteria included: age 40-75 yrs, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) 15-45% predicted, previous pulmonary rehabilitation and a heterogeneity index (tissue\/air ratio of lower lobe\/upper lobe) from high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) \u2265 1.2. Changes in FEV(1), St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), 6-min walk distance (6 MWD), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea score, and hyperinflation were measured at baseline, and 3 and 6 months post-BTVA. At 6 months, mean \u00b1 SE FEV(1) improved by 141 \u00b1 26 mL (p<0.001) and residual volume was reduced by 406 \u00b1 113 mL (p<0.0001). SGRQ total score improved by 14.0 \u00b1 2.4 points (p<0.001), with 73% improving by \u2265 4 points. Improvements were observed in 6 MWD (46.5 \u00b1 10.6 m) and mMRC dyspnoea score (0.9 \u00b1 0.2) (p<0.001 for both). Lower respiratory events (n=11) were the most common adverse event and occurred most often during the initial 30 days. BTVA therapy results in clinically relevant improvements in lung function, quality of life and exercise tolerance in upper lobe predominant emphysema.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007384","authors":["Snell G","Herth FJ","Hopkins P","Baker KM","Witt C","Gotfried MH","Valipour A","Wagner M","Stanzel F","Egan J","Kesten S","Ernst A","Gregory Snell","Felix J.F.
