Their natural migration has selected for traits that increase fitness within geographical areas, but in parallel their domestication has selected for traits that enhance productivity and survival under local conditions. Elucidating the biochemical mechanisms of these local adaptive processes is a key goal of evolutionary biology. Proteomics provides tools unique among the major 'omics disciplines for identifying the mechanisms employed by an organism in adapting to environmental challenges.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010PLoSO...511096P","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Robert Parker","Andony P.
