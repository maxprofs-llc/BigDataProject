We have recently reported the isolation and characterization of several compounds as markers to develop HPLC profiling of its methanol and aqueous methanol extracts. Now, a HPLC-PDA inactive compound, (+)-pinitol has been isolated and characterized from the bark of this medicinally important tree. Pinitol is a well known bioactive compound for a variety of biological activities, including hypoglycemic and anti-inflammatory activities. A process for the isolation of relatively good concentration of (+)-pinitol from S. asoca bark has been developed and its in vitro anti TNF-\u03b1 and anti-inflammatory activities against carragenan-induced edema confirmed. While conducting experiments on the possible agonistic activity, it was found that (+)-pinitol showed up to eight fold reduction in the doses of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. The mechanism of its agonistic activity was studied by docking experiments which showed that different conformations of (+)-pinitol and antibiotics were actually in the same binding site with no significant change in the binding energy. These docking simulations, thus predict the possible binding mode of studied compounds and probable reason behind the synergistic effect of (+)-pinitol along with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f61000119d","authors":["Ahmad, Furkan","Misra, Laxminarain","Gupta, Vivek Kumar","Darokar, Mahendra Pandurang","Prakash, Om","Khan, Feroz","Shukla, Rakesh"],"doi":"10.1080\/10286020.2015.1075005","endpage":"183","first_seen_on":"2016-07-11T08:29:12+00:00","issns":["1477-2213","1028-6020"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Asian Natural Products Research","last_mentioned_on":1468225794,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26527419?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26527419","pubdate":"2015-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"172","subjects":["chemistry","botany"],"title":"\n              Synergistic effect of (+)-pinitol from\n              Saraca asoca\n              with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and studies on the\n              in silico\n              possible mechanism\n            ","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synergistic-effect-pinitol-saraca-asoca-%CE%B2lactam-antibiotics-studies-silico-possible-mechanism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063512,"mean":6.842512696265,"rank":6124848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1081339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063512,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258997,"mean":11.661372646682,"rank":182581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":40958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258997,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215,"mean":1.2269158878505,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.48125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
