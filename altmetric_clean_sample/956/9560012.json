Cinacalcet effectively controls SHPT without causing hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. However, there is significant inter-individual response variance to cinacalcet treatment. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the genetic effects related with parathyroid hormone regulation as factors for cinacalcet response variance.\nPatients with a diagnosis of SHPT based on intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) >300 pg\/mL on dialysis were included in this study. They were over 18 years and have been treated by cinacalcet for more than 3 months. Responders and nonresponders were grouped by the serum iPTH changes. Twenty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms of CASR, VDR, FGFR1, KL, ALPL, RGS14, NR4A2, and PTHLH genes were selected for the pharmacogenetic analysis.\nAfter adjusting for age, sex, and calcium level, CASR rs1042636 (odds ratio [OR]: 0.066, P=0.027) and rs1802757 (OR: 10.532, P=0.042) were associated with cinacalcet response. The association of haplotypes of CASR rs1042636, rs10190, and rs1802757; GCC (OR: 0.355, P=0.015); and ATT (OR: 2.769, P=0.014) with cinacalcet response was also significant.\nWe obtained supporting information of the associations between cinacalcet response and CASR polymorphisms. CASR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1802757, rs1042636, and haplotypes of rs1042636, rs10190, and rs1802757 were significantly associated with cinacalcet response variance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbff","authors":["Jung Mi Oh","In-Wha Kim","Kook-Hwan Oh","Nayoung Han","Kwon Wook Joo","Hyo Jin Kim","Sohyun Jeong"],"doi":"10.2147\/dddt.s103370","first_seen_on":"2016-07-11T00:12:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-8881"],"journal":"Drug Design, Development and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1468195926,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/pharmacogenetic-analysis-of-cinacalcet-response-in-secondary-hyperpara-peer-reviewed-article-DDDT"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=31279","pmcid":"PMC4944925","pmid":"27468225","pubdate":"2016-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Pharmacogenetic analysis of cinacalcet response in secondary hyperparathyroidism patients","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacogenetic-analysis-cinacalcet-response-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063512,"mean":6.842512696265,"rank":6982236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063512,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258996,"mean":11.661490067376,"rank":218038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258996,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1023,"mean":3.8213502935421,"rank":701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1023,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":10.129582089552,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DoveTherapeutic\/statuses\/752294356971761664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9560012],"posted_on":"2016-07-11T00:12:06+00:00","author":{"name":"DovePressTherapeutic","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=24","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294900345\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest articles covering all aspects of drug development, testing and applications, published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DoveTherapeutic","tweeter_id":"53283807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":34},"tweet_id":"752294356971761664"}]}}
