Recently reported in children, vascularized periosteal grafts showed promising revascularizing properties. We report a novel technique using a pedicled periosteal graft from the first metatarsal bone to treat steroid-induced early Ficat-Arlet stage III ONT in an 11-year-old boy. The patient presented initial favorable clinical and radiological results which were maintained at 34 months during the last follow-up. Through this original technique, and basing on the powerful osteogenic and vasculogenic propreties of periosteal flaps, we could effectively induce bone revascularization and prevent further collapse of the talar dome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f610008195","authors":["Soldado F","Barrera-Ochoa S","Fontecha CG","Haddad S","Barastegui D","Barber I","Rego P"],"doi":"10.1002\/micr.22045","first_seen_on":"2012-09-20T08:06:46+00:00","issns":["0738-1085"],"issue":"","journal":"Microsurgery","last_mentioned_on":1348839519,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22976600"],"pmid":"22976600","pubdate":"2012-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Vascularized periosteal graft from the first metatarsal bone: A new technique to prevent collapse of osteonecrosis of the talus in children.
