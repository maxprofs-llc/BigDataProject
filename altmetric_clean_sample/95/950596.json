These compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectra, UV-vis spectra,(1)H NMR, electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The Zn(II) in [Zn(Tab)(2)L(n)](2+)dications of 2-5 is tetrahedrally coordinated by two Tab ligands and one L or two N-Meim ligands. In 6, the Zn(II) has a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry, coordinated by two Tab ligands and one tridentate bppy ligand. The Co(III) in the [Co(Tab)(2)(L)(2)](3+) trications of 7-9 is octahedraly chelated by two bidentate L ligands and two Tab ligands. In 10, the Co(II) adopts a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry, coordinated by one Cl(-), one Tab ligand, and one tridentate bdmppy. In the formation of 2-6, two Tab ligands are removed from the [Zn(Tab)(4)](2+) dication when it is attacked by L ligands, while in the cases of 7-9, the Zn(II) of the [Zn(Tab)(4)](2+) dication was replaced by Co(III) (derived from oxidation of Co(II) by O(2)) followed by the removal of two Tab ligands via L ligands. In the case of 10, the central Zn(II) of the [Zn(Tab)(4)](2+) dication was displaced by Co(II) followed by the removal of three Tab ligands via one Cl(-) and one tridentate bdmppy. These ligand and metal replacement reactions may provide some interesting information on the interactions of the [Zn(S-Cys)(4)](2-) unit of Zn-MTs with N-heterocyclic ligands and toxic metal ions encountered in a natural environment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Ai-Xia Zheng","Jing Si","Xiao-Yan Tang","Li-Li Miao","Miao Yu","Kai-Peng Hou","Fan Wang","Hong-Xi Li","Jian-Ping Lang"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic301191n","first_seen_on":"2012-09-17T20:42:15+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1348120432,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic301191n"],"pmid":"22985442","pubdate":"2012-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"120917095844009","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              Reactions of the Cationic Zinc Thiolate Model Complex [Zn(Tab)\n              \n              ](PF\n              \n              )\n              \n              with N-Donor Ligands and Cobalt Dichloride\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reactions-cationic-zinc-thiolate-model-complex-zntab4-pf62-ndonor-ligands-cobalt-dichloride"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2122959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2225828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79152,"mean":5.4601585576935,"rank":33335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":42593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79152,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.454657219073,"rank":1909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":3887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":386,"mean":0.78337662337662,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":386,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
