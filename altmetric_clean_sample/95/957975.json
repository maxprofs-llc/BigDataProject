In a double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial, 44 mothers with active caries and their 6- to 35-month-old children were randomized to xylitol-wipe or placebo-wipe groups. The children's caries scores were recorded at baseline and 1 year. Salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were enumerated at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Data were analyzed by intent-to-treat modeling with imputation for caries lesions and a linear mixed-effect model for bacterial levels. Significantly fewer children in the xylitol-wipe group had new caries lesions at 1 year compared with those in the placebo-wipe group (P < 0.05). No significant differences between the two groups were observed in levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli at all time-points. Daily xylitol-wipe application significantly reduced the caries incidence in young children as compared with wipes without xylitol, suggesting that the use of xylitol wipes may be a useful adjunct for caries control in infants (Clinicaltrials.gov registration number CT01468727).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f67","doi":"10.1177\/0022034511434354","first_seen_on":"2012-09-21T10:01:32+00:00","issns":["1544-0591"],"issue":"7 Suppl","journal":"Journal of Dental Research","last_mentioned_on":1412373056,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22699675?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3383105\/"],"pmid":"22699675","pubdate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Effects of Xylitol Wipes on Cariogenic Bacteria and Caries in Young Children","type":"article","volume":"91","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-xylitol-wipes-cariogenic-bacteria-caries-young-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":946089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3550193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79053,"mean":5.44064615696,"rank":16781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":62020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79053,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1069,"mean":4.4358445692884,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1069,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.7142857142857,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
