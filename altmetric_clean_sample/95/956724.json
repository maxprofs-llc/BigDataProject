Response to aspirin did not correlate with age, duration of headache history, family history, or platelet ultrastructure. There is some evidence that response to aspirin is associated with raised platelet aggregation. This pilot study indicates that aspirin is effective in migraine prophylaxis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2a","first_seen_on":"2012-09-20T16:58:14+00:00","issns":["0140-6736"],"issue":"8101","journal":"The Lancet","last_mentioned_on":1348160286,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/82144"],"pmid":"82144","pubdate":"1978-12-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Aspirin prophylaxis in migraine.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aspirin-prophylaxis-migraine-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5346528,"mean":6.2540917679857,"rank":2839084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1815881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5346528,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83436,"mean":5.8293413555462,"rank":39774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":32750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83436,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17051,"mean":24.383208328446,"rank":13383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":2633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17051,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":404,"mean":14.360734491315,"rank":281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":404,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
