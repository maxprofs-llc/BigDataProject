The objective was to determine the knowledge of HV and the degree of being a victim among practicing RNs. A descriptive survey using Briles' Sabotage Savvy Questionnaire, measuring occurrences of HV and nurses' knowledge of HV, was conducted among 2659 RNs in NYS hospitals. Findings demonstrate a significantly greater (P < .05) degree of HV in union versus nonunion cultures and less HV in Magnet\u00ae organizations. Gender and RN education significantly impacted HV. Developing organizational, leadership, and individual interventions to address HV helps create a culture of safety.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e89","doi":"10.1097\/nna.0b013e31826a208f","first_seen_on":"2012-09-21T09:06:50+00:00","issns":["0002-0443"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Nursing Administration","last_mentioned_on":1349625876,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonajournal\/Abstract\/2012\/10000\/The_Degree_of_Horizontal_Violence_in_RNs.9.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jonajournal\/2012\/10000\/The_Degree_of_Horizontal_Violence_in_RNs.9.pdf","pmid":"22968122","pubdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"483","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"The Degree of Horizontal Violence in RNs Practicing in New York State","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/degree-horizontal-violence-rns-practicing-new-york-state"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2932325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1429797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79052,"mean":5.4712280173559,"rank":47882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":28114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79052,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":739,"mean":2.4637344173442,"rank":373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":739,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.165625,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
