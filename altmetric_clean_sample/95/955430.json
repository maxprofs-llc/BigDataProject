Ground level air radioactivity was monitored around the globe immediately after the Fukushima accident. This global effort provided a unique opportunity to trace the surface air mass movement at different sites in the Northern Hemisphere. Based on surface air radioactivity measurements around the globe and the air mass backward trajectory analysis of the Fukushima radioactive plume at various places in the Northern Hemisphere by employing the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model, we show for the first time, that the uninterrupted complete revolution of the mid-latitude Surface Westerlies took place in less than 21 days, with an average zonal velocity of>60 km\/h. The position and circulation time scale of Surface Westerlies are of wide interest to a large number of global researchers including meteorologists, atmospheric researchers and global climate modellers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Hern\u00e1ndez-Ceballos MA","Hong GH","Lozano RL","Kim YI","Lee HM","Kim SH","Yeh SW","Bol\u00edvar JP","Baskaran M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2012.08.024","first_seen_on":"2012-09-20T02:06:26+00:00","issns":["0048-9697","00489697"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1419584803,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0048969712010959","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2012.08.024"],"pmid":"22975305","pubdate":"2012-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Tracking the complete revolution of surface westerlies over Northern Hemisphere using radionuclides emitted from Fukushima ","type":"article","volume":"438C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tracking-complete-revolution-surface-westerlies-northern-hemisphere-using-radionuclides-emitted-fuku"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":822050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3849108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79676,"mean":5.6306346532789,"rank":13693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":65740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79676,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2110,"mean":3.8617980085348,"rank":346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2110,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.63496,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
