Men and women undergraduates (N = 138) read a fictional criminal trial summary of a rape case in which medical testimony from a SANE or a registered nurse (RN) was presented, or no medical testimony was presented. Results indicated that mock jurors were more likely to render guilty verdicts when a SANE testified than when an RN testified, and this relationship was fully mediated by perceived credibility of the nurse as well as provictim perceptions. Results are discussed in terms of the impact of SANE involvement in legal proceedings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f53cf058f610005ebc","authors":["Wasarhaley NE","Simcic TA","Golding JM"],"first_seen_on":"2012-09-20T21:46:48+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"Violence & Victims","last_mentioned_on":1348163100,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22978071"],"pmid":"22978071","pubdate":"2012-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Criminology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychology"],"title":"Mock juror perception of sexual assault nurse examiner testimony.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mock-juror-perception-sexual-assault-nurse-examiner-testimony"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627324,"mean":4.9493148749129,"rank":2018411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":932203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627324,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75663,"mean":5.1416784118844,"rank":36137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75663,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213,"mean":2.541858490566,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.09375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
