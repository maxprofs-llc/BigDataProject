The physiological effects of Lep controlling the body weight and suppressing appetite are mediated by the long form of Lep receptor in the hypothalamus. Lep receptor activates several downstream molecules involved in key pathways related to cell survival such as STAT3, PI3K, MAPK, AMPK, CDK5 and GSK3\u03b2. Collectively, these pathways act in a coordinated manner and form a network that is fully involved in Lep physiological response. Although the major interest in Lep is related to its role in the regulation of energy balance, and since resistance to Lep affects is the primary risk factor for obesity, the interest on their effects on brain cognition and neuroprotection is increasing. Thus, Lep and Lep mimetic compounds now await and deserve systematic exploration as the orchestrator of protective responses in the nervous system. Moreover, Lep might promote the activation of a cognitive process that may retard or even partially reverse selected aspects of Alzheimer's disease or ageing memory loss.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5f","authors":["Iv\u00e1n  Patraca"],"doi":"10.1530\/jme-12-0151","first_seen_on":"2012-09-19T09:17:15+00:00","issns":["1479-6813"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1348045962,"links":["http:\/\/jme.endocrinology-journals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/09\/11\/JME-12-0151.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jme.endocrinology-journals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/09\/11\/JME-12-0151.full.pdf","pmid":"22967480","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","endocrinology"],"title":"NEUROPROTECTIVE AND ANTI-AGEING ROLE OF LEPTIN","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuroprotective-antiageing-role-leptin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":2902635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75710,"mean":5.1307164537902,"rank":56121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75710,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196,"mean":2.0963179487179,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
