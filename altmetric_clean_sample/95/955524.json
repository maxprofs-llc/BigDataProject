The rapidity and efficacy of the approach have suggested applications in counter-bioterrorism, prevention of food contamination, and monitoring the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Strain-level resolution has been reported with diverse bacteria, using library-based and bioinformatics-enabled approaches. Three types of characterization at the strain level have been reported: strain categorization, strain differentiation, and strain identification. Efforts to enhance the library-based approach have involved sample pre-treatment and data reduction strategies. Bioinformatics approaches have leveraged the ever-increasing amount of publicly available genomic and proteomic data to attain strain-level characterization. Bioinformatics-enabled strategies have facilitated strain characterization via intact biomarker identification, bottom-up, and top-down approaches. Rigorous quantitative and advanced statistical analyses have fostered success at the strain level with both approaches. Library-based approaches can be limited by effects of sample preparation and culture conditions on reproducibility, whereas bioinformatics-enabled approaches are typically limited to bacteria, for which genetic and\/or proteomic data are available. Biological molecules other than proteins produced in strain-specific manners, including lipids and lipopeptides, might represent other avenues by which strain-level resolution might be attained. Immunological and lectin-based chemistries have shown promise to enhance sensitivity and specificity. Whereas the limits of the taxonomic resolution of MALDI TOF MS profiling of bacteria appears bacterium-specific, recent data suggest that these limits might not yet have been reached.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f6100080d2","authors":["Sandrin, Todd R.","Goldstein, Jason E.","Schumaker, Stephanie"],"doi":"10.1002\/mas.21359","endpage":"217","first_seen_on":"2012-09-20T04:14:19+00:00","issns":["1098-2787","0277-7037","02777037"],"issue":"3","journal":"Mass Spectrometry Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1491448519,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mas.21359\/abstract;jsessionid=7594D9109E75325887B1D2853881A41A.d04t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/mas.21359&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mas.21359\/abstract;jsessionid=DA42F8839715CE982A30736DD910398B.d02t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mas.21359\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/mas.21359"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mas.21359\/pdf","pmid":"22996584","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
