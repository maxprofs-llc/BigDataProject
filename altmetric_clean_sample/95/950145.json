This raises the question, what is the nature of the expertise involved? Is there a model of clinical judgement or understanding that can accommodate both elements? This paper begins with a summary of a published account of the kinds of situation-specific skill found in anaesthesia. It authors claim that such skills are often neglected because of a prejudice in favour of the 'technical rationality' exemplified in evidence-based medicine but they do not themselves offer a general account of the relation of practical expertise and general medical knowledge. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus provides one model of the relation of general knowledge to situation-specific skilled coping. He claims that the former logically depends on the latter and provides two arguments, which I articulate in the second section, for this. But he mars those arguments by building in the further assumption that such situation-specific responses must be understood as concept-free and thus mindless. That assumption is held in place by three arguments all of which I criticize in the next section to give a unified account of clinical judgement as both practical and conceptually structured and thus justified in the face of a prejudice in favour of 'technical rationality'.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f33cf058f610002d91","authors":["Thornton, Tim"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2753.2010.01386.x","endpage":"291","first_seen_on":"2012-09-17T16:01:13+00:00","issns":["1365-2753"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice","last_mentioned_on":1347897649,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2753.2010.01386.x\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2753.2010.01386.x\/pdf","pmid":"20367849","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"284","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Clinical judgement, expertise and skilled coping","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-judgement-expertise-skilled-coping"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6367740,"mean":5.9832485888635,"rank":4707910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":944727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6367740,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86916,"mean":5.82855398953,"rank":56999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":16022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86916,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":441,"mean":5.0575136363636,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":441,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.1,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
