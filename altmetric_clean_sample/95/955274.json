Fluorogenic reagents such as 7-chloro-N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole-4-sulphonamide (DAABD-Cl) were designed to have high sensitivity for HPLC-fluorescence and -MS\/MS detection and reactivity for cysteine residues in proteins. This comprehensive differential proteomics approach was applied to several tissues, such as mouse liver, mouse brain, horse muscle, breast cancer cell lines, and mouse heart, in order to study fluctuations in protein levels in tissues and cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c62","authors":["Ichibangase T","Imai K"],"first_seen_on":"2012-09-20T00:07:34+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"9","journal":"Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1348100604,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22975486?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22975486","pubdate":"2012-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"FD-LC-MS\/MS Method for Determining Protein Expression and Elucidating Biochemical Events in Tissues and Cells.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fdlcmsms-method-determining-protein-expression-elucidating-biochemical-events-tissues-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2309910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1581569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79054,"mean":5.4663289944721,"rank":37126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":31192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79054,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":841,"mean":2.0339571428571,"rank":369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":841,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":0.78333333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
