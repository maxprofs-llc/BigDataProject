The ANI of each of the core genes that has a phylogeny congruent with the reference species tree of rhizobia was compared to the genomic ANI. This allowed us to identify three housekeeping genes (SMc00019-truA-thrA) whose ANI reflected the intraspecies and interspecies genomic ANI among rhizobial strains, revealing an ANI gap (\u22652%) between the inter- and intra-species comparisons. The intraspecies (96%) and interspecies (94%) ANI boundaries calculated from three genes (SMc00019-truA-thrA) provided a criterion for bacterial species definition and confirmed 621\/629 of known interspecies relationships within Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium and Rhizobium. Some widely studied strains should be renamed. The SMc00019-truA-thrA ANI also correlates well with the genomic ANI of strains in Agrobacterium, Methylobacterium, Ralstonia, Rhodopseudomonas, Cupriavidus and Burkholderia, suggesting their wide applicability in other bacteria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yan Ming Zhang","Chang Fu Tian","Xin Hua Sui","Wen Feng Chen","Wen Xin Chen"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0044936","first_seen_on":"2012-09-18T14:51:27+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1347979881,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0044936"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0044936.pdf","pmid":"23028691","pubdate":"2012-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e44936","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Robust Markers Reflecting Phylogeny and Taxonomy of Rhizobia","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/robust-markers-reflecting-phylogeny-taxonomy-rhizobia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3543045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79082,"mean":5.4382610487981,"rank":61243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79082,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80036,"mean":8.2965760979572,"rank":63674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80036,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3593,"mean":6.2658346325167,"rank":2890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3593,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
