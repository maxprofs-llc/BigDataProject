Research is needed to better understand the roles of economic factors in medical student career choice. The objective of this study was to examine the relationships among debt, income and career choice by comparing students planning PC careers with those aspiring to one of the 12 non-PC fields in which median income exceeds US$300 000 ('high-paying non-primary care' [HPNPC]).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003094","authors":["Grayson, Martha S","Newton, Dale A","Thompson, Lori F"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2923.2012.04340.x","endpage":"991","first_seen_on":"2012-09-19T21:05:35+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2923","0308-0110"],"issue":"10","journal":"Medical Education","last_mentioned_on":1361957723,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2923.2012.04340.x\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1365-2923.2012.04340.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2923.2012.04340.x\/pdf","pmid":"22989132","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"983","subjects":["education"],"title":"Payback time: the associations of debt and income with medical student career choice","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/payback-time-associations-debt-income-medical-student-career-choice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6663342,"mean":6.1609755640579,"rank":428498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":6233722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6663342,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94592,"mean":5.6122268714783,"rank":6135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":88424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94592,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1111,"mean":4.5940918918919,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1111,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.4,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
