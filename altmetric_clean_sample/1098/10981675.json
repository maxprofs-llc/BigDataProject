High-resolution T1 structural MR data were acquired and data analysis was performed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in FMRIB Software Library. The morphological differences were compared between the two groups.\ns Compared with the healthy control subjects, patients with CLBP showed decreased GM volumes in several brain cortical areas including the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, right frontal pole, left insular cortex, left middle and left inferior temporal gyrus (P<0.05, after TFCE correction). Increased GM volumes were found in the patients in the subcortical structures including the left thalamus, bilateral putamen, bilateral nucleus accumben and right caudate nucleus (P<0.05, after TFCE correction).\nPatients with CLBP have different patterns of GM abnormalities in different brain regions, characterized by reduced GM volume in cerebral cortical regions and increased GM volume in the subcortical nuclei. Such changes might be associated with the maladaptation of the brain in chronic pain state.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcfd","authors":["Mao, Cui-Ping","Yang, Quan-Xin","Tang, Jian","Yang, Hua-Juan","Bai, Zhi-Lan","Zhang, Qiu-Juan","Zahid, Nadeem"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-01T14:34:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1673-4254"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao Journal of Southern Medical University","last_mentioned_on":1473691501,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27578570?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27578570"],"pmid":"27578570","pubdate":"2016-08-20T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Brain gray matter abnormalities revealed by voxel-based morphometry in patients with chronic low back pain].","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brain-gray-matter-abnormalities-revealed-voxelbased-morphometry-patients-chronic-low-back-pain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":3968625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4211770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252246,"mean":12.503811001209,"rank":117686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":126752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252246,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":355,"mean":1.0158757062147,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":355,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TC_papers\/statuses\/771355457076142080","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10981675],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T14:34:06+00:00","author":{"name":"TC_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507539334375829504\/IcPjrJI3_normal.jpeg","description":"Pubmed twitterbot: arealization OR patterning OR somatosensory OR thalamus OR thalamocortical OR cortical development","id_on_source":"TC_papers","tweeter_id":"2789910212","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":179},"tweet_id":"771355457076142080"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PainConference\/statuses\/775344469163978752","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10981675],"posted_on":"2016-09-12T14:45:01+00:00","author":{"name":"AnnualPainSummit","url":"http:\/\/www.paintherapeuticsummit.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/743522755971211264\/Dd9mSW2M_normal.jpg","description":"Annual conference covering the field of pain research and drug development.
