We sought to assess the risk of several chronic GI disorders following Giardia infection among active duty US military personnel.\nThis study was designed as a retrospective cohort study in which active duty military personnel with documented G. lamblia infection were assessed for the subsequent risk of developing a chronic GI disorder including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Post-giardia chronic GI disorder risk was compared to risk in uninfected personnel matched on several demographic characteristics and medical encounter information. Data were obtained from the Defense Medical Surveillance System and exposures (1998-2009) with outcomes identified based on documented medical encounters with specific medical billing codes. Modified Poisson regression was used to evaluate the relationship between G. lamblia infection and chronic GI disorders.\nA total of 80 Giardia cases were identified for an estimated incidence of 0.55 cases per 100,000 person-years. Cases were matched to 294 unexposed subjects. After adjusting for important covariates, there was an increased risk of IBS (relative risk: 2.1, p\u2009=\u20090.03) associated with antecedent Giardia infection.\nThese data add to a growing body of literature and demonstrate an increased risk of IBS after infection with G. lamblia.","altmetric_jid":"54e7893b2a83ee46118b459a","authors":["Megan Dormond","Ramiro L.
