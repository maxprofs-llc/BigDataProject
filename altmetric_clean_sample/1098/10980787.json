We evaluated the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on intracellular signaling pathways potentially modulated by oxidative stress in soleus muscle from HF rats.\nFour months after surgery, rats were assigned to Sham, myocardial infarction (MI)-C (without treatment), and MI-NAC (treated with N-acetylcysteine) groups. Two months later, echocardiogram showed left ventricular dysfunction in MI-C; NAC attenuated diastolic dysfunction. Oxidative stress was evaluated in serum and soleus muscle; malondialdehyde was higher in MI-C than Sham and did not differ between MI-C and MI-NAC. Oxidized glutathione concentration in soleus muscle was similar in Sham and MI-C, and lower in MI-NAC than MI-C (Sham 0.168 \u00b1 0.056; MI-C 0.223 \u00b1 0.073; MI-NAC 0.136 \u00b1 0.023 nmol\/mg tissue; p = 0.014). Western blot showed increased p-JNK and decreased p38, ERK1\/2, and p-ERK1\/2 in infarcted rats. NAC restored ERK1\/2. NF-954;B p65 subunit was reduced; p-Ser276 in p65 and I954;B was increased; and p-Ser536 unchanged in MI-C compared to Sham. NAC did not modify NF-954;B p65 subunit, but decreased p-Ser276 and p-Ser536.\nN-acetylcysteine modulates MAPK and NF-954;B signaling pathways in soleus muscle of HF rats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024cd","authors":["Martinez, P.F.","Bonomo, C.","Guizoni, D.M.","Junior, S.A.O.","Damatto, R.L.","Cezar, M.D.M.","Lima, A.R.R.","Pagan, L.U.","Seiva, F.R.","Bueno, R.T.","Fernandes, D.C.","Laurindo, F.R.","Zornoff, L.A.M.","Okoshi, K.","Okoshi, M.P."],"doi":"10.1159\/000445631","endpage":"384","first_seen_on":"2016-09-01T13:45:49+00:00","issns":["1421-9778"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cellular Physiology & Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1472737538,"links":["http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/FullText\/445631","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1159\/000445631?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/445631","pmid":"27351177","pubdate":"2016-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"371","subjects":["cellbiology","pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Modulation of MAPK and NF-&#954;B Signaling Pathways by Antioxidant Therapy in Skeletal Muscle of Heart Failure Rats","type":"article","volume":"39"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":4185494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3915474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251802,"mean":12.49758566487,"rank":127855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":113999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251802,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":980,"mean":2.6298876404494,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":980,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":1.6329268292683,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ArborAssays\/statuses\/771343238133342208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10980787],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T13:45:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Arbor Assays","url":"http:\/\/www.ArborAssays.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558668253656928257\/KYHcmQGG_normal.jpeg","description":"Arbor Assays builds stable, high quality, super sensitive products to measure clinically important biomolecules.","id_on_source":"ArborAssays","tweeter_id":"322085955","geo":{"lt":42.27756,"ln":-83.74088,"country":"US"},"followers":200},"tweet_id":"771343238133342208"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Modulation of MAPK and NF-\u03baB Signaling Pathways by Antioxidant Therapy...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1155964191116634&id=136774719702258","license":"public","citation_ids":[10980787],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T13:45:38+00:00","summary":"Study confirms that antioxidant N-acetylcysteine modulates MAPK & NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in HF rat soleus muscle.  http:\/\/ow.ly\/exPU303Jvrf","author":{"name":"Arbor Assays","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/136774719702258","facebook_wall_name":"Arbor Assays","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/136774719702258\/picture","id_on_source":"136774719702258"}}]}}
