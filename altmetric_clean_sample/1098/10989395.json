Patient with TMD were subjected to computerized tomographic (CT) imaging, and the various bony changes in the TMJ were recorded.\nCT study of TMJ showed that there is a positive evidence of joint involvement in 80% of the cases. In this study, female patients were more commonly affected by OA than the males. The condylar changes (69.93%) are more common than the changes in the articular eminence (6.6%) and condylar fossa (10%). About 56.6% of TMJ in the study was affected by the early manifestations of the OA.\nCT study showed that there is a positive evidence of TMJ involvement in the elderly patients with TMD. The results show that condylar changes are more common than the changes in the articular eminence and condylar fossa. The study also shows that most of the patients are affected by early TMJ OA; hence, initiating treatment at early stages may prevent the disease progression.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef882a83ee09648b54d0","authors":["Massilla Mani, F","Sivasubramanian, S Satha","F.
