Mast cell carboxypeptidase A (MC-CPA) is a prominent secretory granule marker of mast cell differentiation and phenotype. The 32-kb human MC-CPA gene was isolated, localized to chromosome 3, and found to contain 11 exons. No significant homology was found between the 5' flanking region of the MC-CPA gene and those of three rat pancreatic carboxypeptidase genes (carboxypeptidase A1 and A2, and carboxypeptidase B [CPB]). In contrast, the intron\/exon organization of the MC-CPA gene was conserved, most closely resembling the CPB gene. MC-CPA is unique among carboxypeptidases in having a CPA-like substrate-binding pocket and enzymatic activity despite overall protein and gene structures more similar to CPB. Evolutionary tree analysis of the carboxypeptidase gene family showed that, before the mammalian species radiation, a common MC-CPA\/CPB ancestor diverged by gene duplication from the lineage leading to CPA, and then underwent another gene duplication to form separate but similar gene structures for MC-CPA and CPB. MC-CPA mRNA was prominent in dispersed lung cells enriched for mast cells but was undetectable in other nontransformed populations of several lineages, demonstrating that transcription of MC-CPA, a novel carboxypeptidase gene, provides a specific molecular marker for mast cells among normal hematopoietic cell populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cff","authors":["D S Reynolds","D S Gurley","K F Austen"],"doi":"10.1172\/jci115571","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T07:46:13+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9738"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1199577286,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1172\/JCI115571","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1729276","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC442845"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jci.org\/articles\/view\/115571\/files\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC442845","pmid":"1729276","pubdate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Clinical Investigation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Cloning and characterization of the novel gene for mast cell carboxypeptidase A.","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-characterization-novel-gene-mast-cell-carboxypeptidase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":817154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95184,"mean":8.169142914176,"rank":24716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95184,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4192,"mean":9.1387616320687,"rank":1586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4192,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":32.182486486486,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
