Ischemic heart disease, in particular, is responsible for the majority of cardiac-related deaths. Given the negligible regenerative potential of the human myocardium, there is a strong need for therapeutic strategies aiming at enhancing cardiomyocyte survival and proliferation following injury or at inhibiting their death. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules regulating gene expression at a post-transcriptional level with important functions in cardiovascular physiology and disease. It has been demonstrated that miRNAs can influence the ability of cardiomyocytes to enter the cell cycle and\/or escape from death pathways. Additionally, long non coding-RNAs could be involved in such pathways. This review summarizes recent evidences on noncoding RNAs regulating proliferation and death of cardiomyocytes representing a future therapeutic for the treatment of heart diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5b","authors":["Maria-Teresa Piccoli","Shashi Kumar Gupta","Thomas Thum"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yjmcc.2015.02.002","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T09:32:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-8584","00222828"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular & Cellular Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1423711684,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25665459?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022282815000395"],"pmid":"25665459","pubdate":"2015-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","cardiology"],"title":"Noncoding RNAs as regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation and death ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/noncoding-rnas-regulators-cardiomyocyte-proliferation-death"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7049172,"mean":6.2666543370817,"rank":2533653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4492928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7049172,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234892,"mean":8.0624358276819,"rank":71519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":162099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234892,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":663,"mean":2.1741117824773,"rank":172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":663,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":2.3367692307692,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
