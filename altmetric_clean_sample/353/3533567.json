Most nonviral strategies rely upon endosomal escape designs; however, endosomal escape is often uncorrelated with improved gene transfer and membranolytic structures are typically cytotoxic. Previously, we showed that histone-targeted polyplexes trafficked to the nucleus through an alternative route involving caveolae and the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), using pathways similar to several pathogens. We hypothesized that the efficacy of these polyplexes was due to an increased utilization of native vesicular trafficking as well as regulation by histone effectors. Accordingly, using confocal microscopy and cellular fractionation, we determined that a key effect of histone-targeting was to route polyplexes away from clathrin-mediated recycling pathways by harnessing endomembrane transfer routes regulated by histone methyltransferases. An unprecedented finding was that polyplexes accumulated in Rab6-labeled Golgi\/ER vesicles and ultimately shuttled directly into the nucleus during ER-mediated nuclear envelope reassembly. Specifically, super resolution microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy unequivocally indicated that the polyplexes remained associated with ER vesicles\/membranes until mitosis, when they were redistributed into the nucleus. These novel findings highlight alternative mechanisms to subvert endolysosomal trafficking and harness the ER to enhance gene transfer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"5524eb302a83eef6558b4567","authors":["Nikki L Ross","Erik V Munsell","Chandran Sabanayagam","Millicent O Sullivan"],"doi":"10.1038\/mtna.2015.2","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T04:58:20+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["2162-2531"],"journal":"Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids","last_mentioned_on":1423653461,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25668340?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25668340?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25668340","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Histone-targeted Polyplexes Avoid Endosomal Escape and Enter the Nucleus During Postmitotic Redistribution of ER Membranes.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histonetargeted-polyplexes-avoid-endosomal-escape-enter-nucleus-during-postmitotic-redistribution-er"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4747790,"mean":5.7056333468087,"rank":2357250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2247445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4747790,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169715,"mean":8.8191899784346,"rank":81184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":80649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169715,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":3.338132231405,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":4.5222222222222,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
