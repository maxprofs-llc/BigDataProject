One SIRP of unknown function, designated SIRP beta 1, contains a short cytoplasmic domain that lacks sequence motifs capable of recruiting SHP-1 and SHP-2. Using a SIRP-specific mAb, we show that SIRP beta 1 is expressed in monocytes and dendritic cells and associates with the signal transduction molecule DAP12. SIRP beta 1\/DAP12 complex formation was required for efficient cell-surface expression of SIRP beta 1. Stimulation of this complex induced tyrosine phosphorylation, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and cellular activation. Thus, SIRP beta 1 is a new DAP12-associated receptor involved in the activation of myeloid cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Jes Dietrich","Marina Cella","Martina Seiffert","Hans-J\u00f6rg B\u00fchring","Marco Colonna"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.164.1.9","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T07:48:36+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1550-6606","0022-1767"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1199574198,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4049\/jimmunol.164.1.9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10604985"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/164\/1\/9.full.pdf","pmid":"10604985","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Cutting edge: signal-regulatory protein beta 1 is a DAP12-associated activating receptor expressed in myeloid cells.","type":"article","volume":"164","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cutting-edge-signalregulatory-protein-beta-1-dap12associated-activating-receptor-expressed-myeloid-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4108503,"mean":5.1033194562536,"rank":955708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2590409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4108503,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132530,"mean":9.1648541074031,"rank":40978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":89685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132530,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6364,"mean":1.8783510922521,"rank":549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":4450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6364,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":2.5643759398496,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
