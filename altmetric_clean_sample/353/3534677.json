Having established the synteny of the gene with the autosome 16, we proceeded to its precise subregional mapping by in situ fluorescence hybridization with a recombinant lambda phage containing the genomic region homologous to the cDNA gene. The latter studies pin-pointed the chromosomal localization of the structural CDR62 gene within the interval 16p12-16p13.1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002945","authors":["T Gress","A Baldini","M Rocchi","H Furneaux","J B Posner","M Siniscalco"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T05:32:20+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0888-7543"],"issue":"4","journal":"Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1198577773,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1505970"],"pmid":"1505970","pubdate":"1992-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"In situ mapping of the gene coding for a leucine zipper DNA binding protein (CDR62) to 16p12-16p13.1.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/situ-mapping-gene-coding-leucine-zipper-dna-binding-protein-cdr62-16p1216p131"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":817810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94813,"mean":8.110931316711,"rank":24553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94813,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3833,"mean":2.7116988517745,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3833,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.8321176470588,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"CDR2 (gene)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=180089574#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3534674,3534677],"posted_on":"2007-12-25T10:16:13+00:00","summary":"Cerebellar degeneration-related protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CDR2 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14879316","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
