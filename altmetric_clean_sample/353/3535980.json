The ability of LMP1 to mediate at least some of these phenomena could be attributed to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. LMP1 promotes NF-kappaB activation through the recruitment of the adapter protein TRAF2 and the formation of a dynamic multiprotein complex that includes the NF-kappaB kinase, the IkappaB kinases, and their downstream targets, IkappaBs and p105. In this study, we have identified the oncogenic kinase Tpl-2\/Cot as a novel component of LMP1-induced NF-kappaB signaling. We show that Tpl-2 is expressed in primary biopsies from patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin's disease, where LMP1 is also found. Inducible expression of LMP1 promotes the activation of Tpl-2, and a catalytically inactive Tpl-2 mutant suppresses LMP1-induced NF-kappaB signaling. In colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Tpl-2 and TRAF2 were found to interact with Tpl-2 functioning downstream of TRAF2. Consistent with this observation, catalytically inactive Tpl-2 also blocked CD40-mediated NF-kappaB activation, which largely depends on TRAF2. The ability of Tpl-2 to influence LMP1-induced NF-kappaB occurs through modulation of both IkappaBalpha and p105 functions. Furthermore, Tpl-2 was found to influence the expression of angiogenic mediators, such as COX-2 in LMP1-transfected cells. These data identify Tpl-2 as a component of LMP1 signaling downstream of TRAF2 and as a modulator of LMP1-mediated effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Aristides G.
