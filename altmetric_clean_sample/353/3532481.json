(2005) Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 21, 435-456; Lilley, B. N., and Ploegh, H. L. (2004) Nature 429, 834-840; Ye, Y., Shibata, Y., Yun, C., Ron, D., and Rapoport, T. A. (2004) Nature 429, 841-847). We asked whether the components of this pathway are involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of the mammalian integral membrane protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a substrate for the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We report that Derlin-1 and p97 formed complexes with CFTR in human airway epithelial cells. Derlin-1 interacted with nonubiquitylated CFTR, whereas p97 associated with ubiquitylated CFTR. Exogenous expression of Derlin-1 led to its co-localization with CFTR in the ER where it reduced wild type (WT) CFTR expression and efficiently degraded the disease-associated CFTR folding mutants, DeltaF508 and G85E (>90%). Consistent with this, Derlin-1 also reduced the amount of WT or DeltaF508 CFTR appearing in detergent-in-soluble aggregates. An approximately 70% knockdown of endogenous Derlin-1 by RNA interference increased the steady-state levels of WT and DeltaF508 CFTR by 10-15-fold, reflecting its significant role in CFTR degradation. Derlin-1 mediated the degradation of N-terminal CFTR fragments corresponding to the first transmembrane domain of CFTR, but CFTR fragments that incorporated additional domains were degraded less efficiently. These findings suggest that Derlin-1 recognizes misfolded, nonubiquitylated CFTR to initiate its dislocation and degradation early in the course of CFTR biogenesis, perhaps by detecting structural instability within the first transmembrane domain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Fei Sun","Ruilin Zhang","Xiaoyan Gong","Xuehui Geng","Peter F.
