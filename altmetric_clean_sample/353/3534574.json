The contribution of healthy bone development in youth is likely to be as important to fracture prevention as the amount of late adulthood bone loss. Families, schools (particularly physical education), and communities are key settings for health promotion focused on bone-enhancing physical activity. However, little research has explored the topic of health promotion and physical education as they pertain to bone health, so best practices are not known. Based on our understanding of the literature, we present the top 10 research questions in health promotion and physical education that should be answered to advance bone-enhancing physical activity in children and adolescents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000346e","authors":["Kathleen F.
