To assess complex II function, we extended this method by measuring flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-related autofluorescence in electrically stimulated cardiac trabeculae isolated from the right ventricle from the rat at 27\u00a0\u00b0C. NADH and FAD autofluorescence and tension responses were measured when stimulation frequency was increased from 0.5\u00a0Hz to 1, 2 or 3\u00a0Hz for 3 minutes, and thereafter decreased to 0.5\u00a0Hz. Maximal complex I and complex II activity in vitro were determined in saponin-permeabilised right ventricular tissue by respirometry. NADH responses upon an increase in stimulation frequency showed a rapid decline, followed by a slow recovery towards the initial level. FAD responses followed a similar time course, but in opposite direction. The amplitudes of the early rapid changes in NADH and FAD concentration correlated well with the change in tension time integral per second (R(2) = 0.833 and 0.660 for NADH and FAD, respectively), but with different slopes for the up- and down-transient. Maximal velocity of the increase in FAD concentration (16\u00b14 \u03bcM.s(-1) ), measured upon an increase in stimulation frequency from 0.5 to 3\u00a0Hz was considerably smaller than that of the decrease in NADH (78\u00b113 \u03bcM.s(-1) ). The respiration measurements indicated that the maximal velocity of NADH utilisation (143\u00b114 \u03bcM.s(-1) ) was 2.3 times smaller than that of FADH2 (291\u00b119 \u03bcM.s(-1) ). This indicates that in cardiac mitochondria considerable complex II activity reserve is present. This article is protected by copyright.
