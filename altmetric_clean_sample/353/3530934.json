Several genes in the MYCN amplicon, including the DEAD box polypeptide 1 (DDX1) gene, and neuroblastoma-amplified gene (NAG gene), have been found to be frequently co-amplified with MYCN in NB. The aim of this study was to clarify the prognostic significance of the co-amplification or overexpression of DDX1 and NAG with MYCN.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cda","authors":["Setsuko Kaneko","Miki Ohira","Yohko Nakamura","Eriko Isogai","Akira Nakagawara","Michio Kaneko"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00432-006-0156-y","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T03:24:15+00:00","issns":["1432-1335"],"journal":"Journal of Cancer Research & Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1198154743,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00432-006-0156-y","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17028906"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00432-006-0156-y.pdf","pmid":"17028906","pubdate":"2006-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Relationship of DDX1 and NAG gene amplification\/overexpression to the prognosis of patients with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-ddx1-nag-gene-amplificationoverexpression-prognosis-patients-mycnamplified-neuroblastom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95567,"mean":8.1989117049999,"rank":24872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95567,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304,"mean":2.0382574257426,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.85384615384615,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
