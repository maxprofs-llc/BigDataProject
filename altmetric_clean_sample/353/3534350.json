In this study, the effects of BPAF exposure on the testis and the related mechanisms of toxicity were investigated. Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were exposed to BPAF (0, 2, 10, 50 and 200 mg\/kg\/d) for 14 days. Total cholesterol levels in serum were decreased in rats given a dose of 50 and 200 mg\/kg\/d. BPAF concentration in the testes increased with increasing doses of BPAF. Reduced serum testosterone and increased luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were observed in rats in the higher dose groups. Furthermore, BPAF exposure resulted in a dramatic decline in genes and protein involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, transport and steroid biosynthesis. Similarly, the testicular mRNA levels of inhibin B, estrogen receptor (ER\u03b1) and luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) also decreased in rats given a dosage of 200 mg\/kg\/d BPAF. Together, these data demonstrate that BPAF-induced inhibition of testosterone production primarily resulted from the alteration of genes and proteins in the testosterone biosynthesis pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367d","authors":["Feng Y","Yin J","Jiao Z","Shi J","Li M","Shao B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.toxlet.2012.03.802","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T05:21:51+00:00","issns":["0378-4274"],"journal":"Toxicology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1421798400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.toxlet.2012.03.802"],"pmid":"22504055","pubdate":"2012-04-17T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Bisphenol AF may cause testosterone reduction by directly affecting testis function in adult male rats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bisphenol-af-cause-testosterone-reduction-directly-affecting-testis-function-adult-male-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4758435,"mean":5.4946271078382,"rank":1114905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":3057214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4758435,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163831,"mean":8.9185753769152,"rank":48556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":113103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163831,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":732,"mean":2.4904842681259,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":732,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.86666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
