In this study, the distribution of the STa-specific receptors on enterocytes and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) prepared from the anterior jejunum, posterior jejunum, ileum and colon of newborn kids was investigated. The density of STa-receptors on enterocytes and BBMVs was higher in the posterior jejunum than that in other segments of the kids' intestines. Additionally, the affinity of the posterior jejunum STa-receptors was higher than the affinity of receptors present on the epithelium of other intestinal segments. Our findings suggest that the posterior jejunum is a major target for STa within the intestinal tract of newborn kids.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c2","authors":["Ahmad M.
