The gene, ZNFN2A1 (GenBank accession no. AF251025) was localized to chromosome 14q22-q24 and shown to be composed of 11 exons. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of three different mRNA transcripts (4.2, 3 and 1.2kb). The two longer transcripts appear to be expressed in a variety of different tissues, especially in endocrine tissues, while the shorter messenger is limited to testis. Both of the larger transcripts are unusual due to the presence of a 463bp long 5' UTR. Furthermore, the 4.2kb transcript contains a non-standard polyadenylation consensus sequence while the 3kb transcript contains a standard consensus sequence but within the open reading frame. Following in vitro transfection of a DFCP1-containing expression construct, confocal microscopy studies showed a vesicular distribution of DFCP1 suggesting that this protein, like other FYVE-containing proteins, might be involved in membrane trafficking.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["A R Derubeis","M F Young","L Jia","P G Robey","L W Fisher"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T08:56:35+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0378-1119"],"issue":"2","journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":1200345552,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11024279"],"pmid":"11024279","pubdate":"2000-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Double FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1): isolation, cloning and characterization of a novel FYVE finger protein from a human bone marrow cDNA library.","type":"article","volume":"255","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/double-fyvecontaining-protein-1-dfcp1-isolation-cloning-characterization-novel-fyve-finger-protein-h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630112,"mean":4.9307700568987,"rank":816213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630112,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95540,"mean":8.1984745705944,"rank":24856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95540,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3488,"mean":2.3468993404072,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3488,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":1.513156626506,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
