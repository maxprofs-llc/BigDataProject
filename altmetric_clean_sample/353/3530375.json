This gene was found to be overexpressed in various kinds of tumours. The gene product, rck\/p54, consisting of 472 amino-acid residues with molecular weight 53.2 kDa, belongs to the family of DEAD-box RNA helicases. Its ATP-dependent RNA-unwinding activity toward c-myc RNA molecules in vitro has recently been demonstrated. In the present study, limited proteolysis experiments of rck\/p54 were used to truncate the N-terminal domain (residues 1-288; 31.8 kDa) of rck\/p54, leading to successful crystallization of Nc-rck\/p54, i.e. the N-terminal core domain (residues 70-288; 24.5 kDa) of rck\/p54. Crystals of Nc-rck\/p54 were grown to a size suitable for X-ray structure analysis using polyethylene glycol 3350 as the precipitant. The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 65.5, b = 73.1, c = 84.8 A, and diffracts X-rays to beyond 2.0 A resolution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000214a","authors":["Matsui T","Hogetsu K","Akao Y","Tanaka M","Sato T","Kumasaka T","Tanaka N"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T03:08:31+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"Pt 1","journal":"Acta Crystallographica: Section D (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1198142028,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14684915"],"pmid":"14684915","pubdate":"2003-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Crystallization and X-ray analysis of the N-terminal core domain of a tumour-associated human DEAD-box RNA helicase, rck\/p54.","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystallization-xray-analysis-nterminal-core-domain-tumourassociated-human-deadbox-rna-helicase-rckp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632901,"mean":4.9227823810231,"rank":815885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632901,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95962,"mean":8.2441597315578,"rank":25054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95962,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":854,"mean":2.4979531066823,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":854,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":3.0702068965517,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"DDX6","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=179151291#altmetric_citation_10","license":"public","citation_ids":[3530374,3530375],"posted_on":"2007-12-20T09:13:48+00:00","summary":"Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX6 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the DDX6 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14798571","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
