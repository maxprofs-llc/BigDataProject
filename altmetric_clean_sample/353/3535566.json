OXR genes are conserved among all sequenced eukaryotes from yeast to humans. In this study we examine if NCOA7 has an oxidation resistance function similar to that demonstrated for OXR1. We also examine NCOA7 expression in response to oxidative stress and its subcellular localization in human cells, comparing these properties with those of OXR1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ad","authors":["Mathieu Durand","Adrianne Kolpak","Timothy Farrell","Nathan A Elliott","Wenlin Shao","Myles Brown","Michael R Volkert"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2121-8-13","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T06:09:36+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2121","14712121"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1207782032,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2121-8-13","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17391516","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1847813"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2121-8-13.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1847813","pmid":"17391516","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Microscopy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"13","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"The OXR domain defines a conserved family of eukaryotic oxidation resistance proteins","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxr-domain-defines-conserved-family-eukaryotic-oxidation-resistance-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":815956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95908,"mean":8.2282921788818,"rank":25028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95908,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152,"mean":1.8603841059603,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
