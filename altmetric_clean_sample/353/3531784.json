The single enhancer elements responsible for these activities have been identified previously and shown to constitute direct targets of the transcription factor kreisler, which is expressed in r5 and r6. Here, we have analysed the contribution of the transcription factor Krox20, present in r3 and r5. Genetic analyses demonstrated that Krox20 is required for activity of the Hoxb3 r5 enhancer, but not of the Hoxa3 r5\/6 enhancer. Mutational analysis of the Hoxb3 r5 enhancer, together with ectopic expression experiments, revealed that Krox20 binds to the enhancer and synergizes with kreisler to promote Hoxb3 transcription, restricting enhancer activity to their domain of overlap, r5. These analyses also suggested contributions from an Ets-related factor and from putative factors likely to heterodimerize with kreisler. The integration of multiple independent inputs present in overlapping domains by a single enhancer is likely to constitute a general mechanism for the patterning of subterritories during vertebrate development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Miguel Manzanares","Jeannette Nardelli","Pascale Gilardi\u2010Hebenstreit","Heather Marshall","Fran\u00e7ois Giudicelli","Mar\u00eda Teresa Mart\u00ednez\u2010Pastor","Robb Krumlauf","Patrick Charnay"],"doi":"10.1093\/emboj\/21.3.365","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T03:52:06+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1460-2075","0261-4189"],"issue":"3","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1198213341,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/emboj\/21.3.365","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11823429","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC125344"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/content\/embojnl\/21\/3\/365.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC125344","pmid":"11823429","pubdate":"2002-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"EMBO Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Krox20 and kreisler co-operate in the transcriptional control of segmental expression of Hoxb3 in the developing hindbrain","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/krox20-kreisler-cooperate-transcriptional-control-segmental-expression-hoxb3-developing-hindbrain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631524,"mean":4.926174121992,"rank":816066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631524,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95788,"mean":8.2124859114496,"rank":24972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95788,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999,"mean":3.1885267633817,"rank":587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":7.5590909090909,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
