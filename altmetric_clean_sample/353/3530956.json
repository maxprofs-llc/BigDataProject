Here we develop a series of transposon-derived dominant mutants of Pes1, the mouse homolog of the zebrafish Pescadillo and yeast Nop7p implicated in ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation control. Six Pes1 mutants selected by their ability to reversibly arrest the cell cycle also impair maturation of the 28S and 5.8S rRNAs in mouse cells. We show that Pes1 physically interacts with the nucleolar protein Bop1, and both proteins direct common pre-rRNA processing steps. Interaction with Bop1 is essential for the efficient incorporation of Pes1 into nucleolar preribosomal complexes. Pes1 mutants defective for the interaction with Bop1 lose the ability to affect rRNA maturation and the cell cycle. These data show that coordinated action of Pes1 and Bop1 is necessary for the biogenesis of 60S ribosomal subunits.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","doi":"10.1016\/j.molcel.2004.05.020","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T03:24:45+00:00","issns":["1097-2765"],"journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1198155887,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.molcel.2004.05.020","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15225545"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1097276504003065\/pdf","pmid":"15225545","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Physical and functional interaction between Pes1 and Bop1 in mammalian ribosome biogenesis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physical-functional-interaction-between-pes1-bop1-mammalian-ribosome-biogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":817868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94753,"mean":8.1100011820332,"rank":24528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94753,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3051,"mean":4.0892150819672,"rank":755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3051,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.182,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
