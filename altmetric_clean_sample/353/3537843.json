Cdc2 associates with the B-type cyclins, and the Cdc2-cyclin B heterodimer is in turn regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of threonine 161 is required for the Cdc2-cyclin B complex to be catalytically active, whereas phosphorylation of threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 is inhibitory. Human kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of threonine 161 and tyrosine 15 have been identified. Here we report the isolation of a novel human cDNA encoding a dual-specificity protein kinase (designated Myt1Hu) that preferentially phosphorylates Cdc2 on threonine 14 in a cyclin-dependent manner. Myt1Hu is 46% identical to Myt1Xe, a kinase recently characterized from Xenopus laevis. Myt1Hu localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex in HeLa cells. A stretch of hydrophobic and uncharged amino acids located outside the catalytic domain of Myt1Hu is the likely membrane-targeting domain, as its deletion results in the localization of Myt1Hu primarily to the nucleus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["F Liu","J J Stanton","Z Wu","H Piwnica-Worms"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T07:58:07+00:00","issns":["0270-7306"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1199558376,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9001210","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC231782"],"pmcid":"PMC231782","pmid":"9001210","pubdate":"1997-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"The human Myt1 kinase preferentially phosphorylates Cdc2 on threonine 14 and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-myt1-kinase-preferentially-phosphorylates-cdc2-threonine-14-localizes-endoplasmic-reticulum-go"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":816902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95251,"mean":8.1771118320212,"rank":24742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95251,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3660,"mean":2.4837890133916,"rank":199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3660,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.0077777777778,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
