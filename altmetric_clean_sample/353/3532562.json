Separation by gas chromatography and identification by gas chromotography-mass spectrometry was achieved by the preparation of trimethylsilyl, d9-trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl and tri-n-propylsilyl derivatives.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb9","authors":["D J Harvey"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T04:18:10+00:00","issns":["0022-3573"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1416081172,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6715"],"pmid":"6715","pubdate":"1976-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacy","pharmacology"],"title":"Characterization of the butyl homologues of delta1-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabinol and cannabidiol in samples of cannabis by combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-butyl-homologues-1tetrahydrocannabinol-cannabinol-cannabidiol-samples-cannabis-comb"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507953,"mean":5.1586375230457,"rank":1011068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2930923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507953,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152531,"mean":8.6178128368193,"rank":42280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":108392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152531,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":489,"mean":1.9934713114754,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":489,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.3269230769231,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
