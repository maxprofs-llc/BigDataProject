In the case of tuberculosis, virulent mycobacteria induce host production of anti-inflammatory mediators, including lipoxins, which limit the host inflammatory response and lead to necrotic cell death of infected macrophages. Recent work using the zebrafish model suggests that, while excess anti-inflammatory lipoxins are host detrimental during mycobacterial infections, excess pro-inflammatory lipids also drive host susceptibility. The balance of these inflammatory states is influenced by common human genetic variation in Asia. Fuller understanding of the mechanisms of eicosanoid-mediated inflammatory imbalance during tuberculosis infection has important implications for the development of adjunctive therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a7","authors":["Tobin DM","Ramakrishnan L","David M Tobin","Lalita Ramakrishnan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.coph.2013.06.007","endpage":"645","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T07:41:01+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["14714892","1471-4892"],"issue":"4","journal":"Current Opinion in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1423674361,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1471489213001173"],"pmid":"23849093","pubdate":"2013-08-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"641","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"TB: the Yin and Yang of lipid mediators ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1471489213001173","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tb-yin-yang-lipid-mediators"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4747790,"mean":5.7056333468087,"rank":3168897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1569805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4747790,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169703,"mean":8.8219186574115,"rank":111054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":58425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169703,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":359,"mean":2.688905027933,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":359,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.9166666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
