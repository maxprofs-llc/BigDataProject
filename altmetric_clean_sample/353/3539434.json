Type I cross-links, which are one-dimensional, are formed by a divalent lectin and a divalent glycoconjugate. Type II cross-links, which are two or three-dimensional, occur when a lectin or glycoconjugate has a valence greater than two. Type II complexes are a source of additional specificity, since homogeneous type II complexes are formed in the presence of mixtures of lectins and glycoconjugates. This additional specificity is thought to become important when a lectin interacts with clusters of glycoconjugates, e.g. as is present on the cell surface. The cryst1al structure of the Glc\/Man binding legume lectin FRIL in complex with a trisaccharide provides a molecular snapshot of how weak protein-protein interactions, which are not observed in solution, can become important when a cross-linked complex is formed. In solution, FRIL is a divalent dimer, but in the crystal FRIL forms a tetramer, which allows for the formation of an intricate type II cross-linked complex with the divalent trisaccharide. The dependence on weak protein-protein interactions can ensure that a specific type II cross-linked complex and its associated specificity can occur only under stringent conditions, which explains why lectins are often found forming higher-order oligomers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","authors":["Thomas W Hamelryck","Jeffrey G Moore","Maarten J Chrispeels","Remy Loris","Lode Wyns"],"doi":"10.1006\/jmbi.2000.3785","endpage":"883","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T09:47:22+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["00222836","0022-2836"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1301302913,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1006\/jmbi.2000.3785","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10843844"],"pmid":"10843844","pubdate":"2000-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"875","title":"The role of weak protein-protein interactions in multivalent lectin-carbohydrate binding: crystal structure of cross-linked FRIL.","type":"article","volume":"299","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-weak-proteinprotein-interactions-multivalent-lectincarbohydrate-binding-crystal-structure-cross"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635017,"mean":4.9194226118571,"rank":816033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635017,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96306,"mean":8.2462632885106,"rank":25202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96306,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3302,"mean":2.5178012723417,"rank":250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3302,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.424,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
