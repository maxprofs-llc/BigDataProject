However, to date there is limited evidence on how to monitor patients with asthma. Childhood asthma introduces specific challenges in terms of deciding what, when, how often, by whom and in whom different assessments of asthma should be performed. The age of the child, the fluctuating course of asthma severity, variability in clinical presentation, exacerbations, comorbidities, socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, and environmental exposures may all influence disease activity and, hence, monitoring strategies. These factors will be addressed in herein. We identified large knowledge gaps in the effects of different monitoring strategies in children with asthma. Studies into monitoring strategies are urgently needed, preferably in collaborative paediatric studies across countries and healthcare systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007385","authors":["L\u00f8drup Carlsen, Karin C","Pijnenburg, Mari\u00eblle W",", "],"doi":"10.1183\/16000617.00003714","first_seen_on":"2015-06-02T10:10:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-0617"],"issue":"136","journal":"European Respiratory Review","last_mentioned_on":1457614027,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26028630?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26028630?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/err.ersjournals.com\/content\/24\/136\/178","http:\/\/err.ersjournals.com\/content\/24\/136\/178.short","http:\/\/err.ersjournals.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/24\/136\/178"],"pmid":"26028630","pubdate":"2015-06-02T22:02:47+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Monitoring asthma in childhood","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monitoring-asthma-childhood-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377175,"mean":6.4096998099772,"rank":3246672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4058498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377175,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216430,"mean":8.2834849673566,"rank":91618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":120624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216430,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300,"mean":5.8823946488294,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.75,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
