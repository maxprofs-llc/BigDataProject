The 3C method begins with whole-cell formaldehyde fixation of chromatin. After cell lysis, solubilized chromatin is digested with a type II restriction endonuclease, and cross-linked DNA fragments are ligated together. Cross-links are reversed by degradation with proteinase K, and chimeric DNA molecules are purified by standard phenol:chloroform extraction. The resulting 3C library represents chromatin fragments that may be separated by large genomic distances or located on different chromosomes, but are close enough in three-dimensional space for cross-linking. Locus-specific oligonucleotide primers are used to detect interactions of interest in the 3C library using end-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f3d","authors":["Belton, Jon-Matthew","Dekker, Job"],"doi":"10.1101\/pdb.prot085175","first_seen_on":"2015-06-03T12:04:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-6095"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cold Spring Harbor Protocols","last_mentioned_on":1433334040,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26034304?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26034304","pubdate":"2015-06-03T22:01:46+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) in Budding Yeast.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chromosome-conformation-capture-3c-budding-yeast"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5180928,"mean":6.1198316031113,"rank":3643208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":869006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5180928,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175004,"mean":8.8039800460565,"rank":124239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175004,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":2.205734375,"rank":236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.2572727272727,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
