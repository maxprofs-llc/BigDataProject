The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and acceptance of GM but also to shed light on the multifactorial process leading to acceptance of genetic modifications among Western Balkan students of life sciences.\nIn this cross-sectional study, the final study population sample was composed of 1251 university students. The instrument for data collection was a questionnaire consisting of 49 items composed of 5 sections taken from the literature. Attitudes toward GM were analyzed by using Q-mode factor analysis and principal component analysis was run for the assessment of perception of personal health risks. The acceptability of GM was analyzed in binary probit models assessing the acceptability of GM products in different areas of application with Q models, sociodemographic variables, perception of personal health risks factors, respondents' knowledge about biotechnology, gender, and age as explanatory variables.\nThis study demonstrated that students of life sciences supported the implementation of GM in industry and medicine production but not in food production. Their acceptance was most influenced by 3 out of 5 attitude models that were identified (p < 0.0001). Regarding the perception of personal health risks, the factor \"credence risks\" was seen as a negative predictor of acceptance of GM in industry and food production (p < 0.05). The main knowledge predictor of rejecting GM was misconception, whereas real knowledge had no impact (p < 0.0001).\nThe AGREE study provided the first rough picture of the knowledge, attitudes, and acceptance of GM in this area. Given the target population, it could be expected that the general population's acceptance of all observed elements, especially knowledge, would be lower.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e94","authors":["Vladica Veli\u010dkovi\u0107"],"doi":"10.1080\/07315724.2014.1003115","first_seen_on":"2015-06-02T19:12:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1541-1087"],"journal":"The Journal of the American College of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1433533333,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07315724.2014.1003115","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07315724.2014.1003115#.VW33btLtmko"],"pmid":"26030071","pubdate":"2015-06-02T22:01:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Knowledge, Attitudes Toward, and Acceptability of Genetic Modification among Western Balkan University Students of Life Sciences (AGREE Study)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/knowledge-attitudes-toward-acceptability-genetic-modification-among-western-balkan-university-studen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5190641,"mean":6.1260720832137,"rank":2071155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3082232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5190641,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175050,"mean":8.8326453621559,"rank":68115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":104740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175050,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":711,"mean":10.515881690141,"rank":414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":711,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":26.120714285714,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
