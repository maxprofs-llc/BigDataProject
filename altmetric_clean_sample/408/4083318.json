However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between maternal alcohol consumption and CHDs in offspring has not been conducted.\nWe searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles catalogued between their inception and February 16, 2015; we identified relevant published studies that assessed the association between maternal alcohol consumption and CHD risk. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the retrieved articles and extracted data from them. Study-specific relative risk estimates were pooled by random-effects or fixed-effects models.\nFrom the 1527 references, a total of 19 case-control studies and four cohort studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The summary of 23 studies related to CHDs indicated an overall pooled relative risk of 1.13 (95% confidence interval: 0.96, 1.29) among mothers drinking before or during pregnancy. Statistically significant heterogeneity was detected (Q = 196.61, P < .001, I(2) = 88.8%) with no publication bias (Egger's test: P = .157). We conducted stratified and meta-regression analyses to identify the origin of the heterogeneity among studies.\nIn summary, this meta-analysis provided no positive association between maternal alcohol consumption and risk of CHDs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5223cf058f610003ada","authors":["Sun, Jian","Chen, Xiaoling","Chen, Huajun","Ma, Zhengliang","Zhou, Jianwei"],"doi":"10.1111\/chd.12271","endpage":"E224","first_seen_on":"2015-06-02T21:32:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1747-0803"],"issue":"5","journal":"Congenital Heart Disease","last_mentioned_on":1433991601,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/chd.12271\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/chd.12271","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/chd.12271\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/chd.12271\/pdf","pmid":"26032942","pubdate":"2015-06-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"E216","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Maternal Alcohol Consumption before and during Pregnancy and the Risks of Congenital Heart Defects in Offspring: A Systematic Review and Meta\u2010analysis","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maternal-alcohol-consumption-before-during-pregnancy-risks-congenital-heart-defects-offspring-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6373325,"mean":5.9858376304108,"rank":4712592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":944827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6373325,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178729,"mean":8.9294814242872,"rank":125311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":33956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178729,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":0.93565517241379,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.85555555555556,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
