However, public systems undertaking comprehensive improvement efforts that aim to increase availability of multiple practices at the same time may struggle to build comprehensive and user-friendly strategies to develop the workforce and encourage adoption, faithful implementation, and sustainability of selected EBPs. Given that research shows model adherence predicts positive outcomes, one critical EBP implementation support is systematic quality, fidelity, and compliance monitoring. This paper describes the development and initial implementation of a quality assurance framework for a statewide EBP initiative within child welfare. This initiative aimed to improve provider practice and monitor provider competence and compliance across four different EBPs, and to inform funding and policy decisions. The paper presents preliminary data as an illustration of lessons learned during the quality monitoring process and concludes with a discussion of the promise and challenges of developing and applying a multi-EBP quality assurance framework for use in public systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002178","authors":["Georganna Sedlar","Eric J.
