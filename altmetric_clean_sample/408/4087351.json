(M. Somoza)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Light as an external trigger is a valuable and easily controllable tool for directing chemical reactions with high spatial and temporal accuracy. Two o-nitrobenzyl derivatives, benzoyl- and thiophenyl-NPPOC, undergo photo-deprotection with significantly improved efficiency over that of the commonly used NPPOC group. The two- and twelvefold increase in photo-deprotection efficiency was proven using photolithograph synthesis of microarrays.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Kretschy, Nicole","Holik, Ann\u2010Katrin","Somoza, Veronika","Stengele, Klaus\u2010Peter","Somoza, Mark M.","Holik, Ann-Katrin","Stengele, Klaus-Peter","Somoza, Mark M"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201502125","endpage":"8559","first_seen_on":"2015-06-03T15:00:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"29","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
