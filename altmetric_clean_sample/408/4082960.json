A literature search covering the period from 2003 to May, 2014 was conducted using PubMed and the following search terms: \"non-small cell lung cancer\", \"NSCLC\", \"adjuvant chemotherapy\", \"randomized\", \"randomised\", \"biomarkers\", \"prognostic\", \"predictive\". This review focuses on current knowledge of biomarkers for prognosis or efficacy of adjuvant treatment following complete resection in stage I-IIIA NSCLC patients. This review includes results on 18 different biomarkers and five gene profiles. A statistically significant prognostic impact was reported for: iNTR, TUBB3, RRM1, ERCC1, BRCA1, p53, MRP2, MSH2, TS, mucin, BAG-1, pERK1\/2, pAkt-1, microRNA, TopIIA, 15-gene profile, 92-gene profile, 31-gene profile and 14-gene profile. A statistically significant predictive impact was reported for: ERCC1, p53, MSH2, p27, TUBB3, PARP1, ATM, 37-gene profile, 31-gene profile, 15-gene profile and 92-gene profile. Uncertainties regarding the optimal analysis method and cut-off levels for the individual markers may blur the prognostic or predictive signals. None of the possible predictive markers have been validated in prospective trials. Thus, there are no biomarkers ready to use in an adjuvant setting in NSCLC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007385","authors":["Wallerek, Sandra","S\u00f8rensen, Jens Benn"],"doi":"10.1183\/16000617.00005814","first_seen_on":"2015-06-02T19:29:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-0617"],"issue":"136","journal":"European Respiratory Review","last_mentioned_on":1434960253,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26028645?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/err.ersjournals.com\/content\/24\/136\/340.full","http:\/\/err.ersjournals.com\/content\/24\/136\/340"],"pmid":"26028645","pubdate":"2015-06-02T22:02:47+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Biomarkers for efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy following complete resection in NSCLC stages I\u2013IIIA","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomarkers-efficacy-adjuvant-chemotherapy-following-complete-resection-nsclc-stages-iiiia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5263558,"mean":6.1954866878068,"rank":2341168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2864267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5263558,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176684,"mean":8.8641075598673,"rank":78853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":94464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176684,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260,"mean":4.754888030888,"rank":156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.705,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
