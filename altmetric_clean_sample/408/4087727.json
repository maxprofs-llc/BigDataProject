County grantees were pair matched and randomized to receive funding for implementation in year 1 (2010-2011) or year 2 (2011-2012). MVPA\/sedentary time was assessed via accelerometer with demographics assessed via self-report in 3 waves of data collection (fall 2010, 2011, and 2012).\nMVPA and sedentary time measured via accelerometry.\nAfter adjusting for covariates, there was no difference in MVPA between counties implementing in year 1 (2010-2011) and those implementing in year 2 (2011-2012; ie, waitlist controls) comparing data collection wave 1 to wave 2 (fall 2010-2011). A significant increase of 2.32 minutes per day of MVPA was observed following the implementation year across all counties as compared with the baseline year. Differences were largely driven by increased MVPA in elementary school youth (fourth and fifth grades). No significant changes in sedentary time were observed.\nLow-cost, high-reach mini-grants can have a small, but meaningful effect on children's MVPA, with greater effects seen in younger children. Future studies should examine characteristics of mini-grants projects that are associated with the greatest increases in MVPA among youth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a99","authors":["Moore, Justin B","Brinkley, Jason","Morris, Sara F","Oniffrey, Theresa M","Kolbe, Mary Bea","Moore, Justin B.","Morris, Sara F.","Oniffrey, Theresa M."],"doi":"10.1097\/phh.0000000000000274","endpage":"378","first_seen_on":"2015-06-03T16:11:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1078-4659","1550-5022"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Public Health Management & Practice","last_mentioned_on":1473539888,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jphmp\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Effectiveness_of_Community_Based_Mini_Grants_to.99742.aspx","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jphmp\/9000\/00000\/Effectiveness_of_Community_Based_Mini_Grants_to.99742.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jphmp\/Abstract\/2016\/07000\/Effectiveness_of_Community_Based_Minigrants_to.7.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jphmp\/Fulltext\/2016\/07000\/Effectiveness_of_Community_Based_Minigrants_to.7.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26035650"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jphmp\/9000\/00000\/Effectiveness_of_Community_Based_Mini_Grants_to.99742.pdf","pmid":"26035650","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"370","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Effectiveness of Community-Based Mini-Grants to Increase Physical Activity and Decrease Sedentary Time in Youth.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jphmp\/Fulltext\/2016\/07000\/Effectiveness_of_Community_Based_Minigrants_to.7.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-communitybased-minigrants-increase-physical-activity-decrease-sedentary-time-youth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":1043460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7309575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222513,"mean":8.592721803768,"rank":36809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":185622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222513,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1280,"mean":3.23170758405,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1280,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":2.5137931034483,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":4,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
