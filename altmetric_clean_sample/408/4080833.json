Preliminary results suggest that juvenile abundance is negatively correlated with increasing coastal current speed at river mouth entry (P < 0\u00b705). These findings indicate that at least under some circumstances, tidally driven coastal currents may influence recruitment to freshwater habitats; therefore, it is presumed that high coastal current speed at the entry to river mouths may reduce the likelihood of freshwater entry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002da9","authors":["Barry, J.","Mcharg, K.","Dodd, J.
