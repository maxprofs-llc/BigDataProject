The objective of the present study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients with mainly lymphoma and multiple myeloma after autologous stem cell transplant. The pretransplant workup consisted of the complete blood count, an evaluation of the liver, kidney, lung, and infectious profile, chest radiographs, and a dental review. For lymphoma, all patients who achieved at least a 25% reduction in the disease after salvage therapy were included in the study. Mobilization was done with cyclophosphamide, followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, 300 \u00b5g twice daily. The conditioning regimens included BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) and high-dose melphalan. A total of 206 transplants were performed from April 2004 to December 2014. Of these, 137 were allogeneic transplants and 69 were autologous. Of the patients receiving an autologous transplant, 49 were male and 20 were female. Of the 69 patients, 26 underwent transplantation for Hodgkin's lymphoma, 23 for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 15 for multiple myeloma and 4 and 1 for Ewing's sarcoma and neuroblastoma, respectively. The median age \u00b1 SD was 34 \u00b1 13.1 years (range, 4-64). A mean of 4.7 \u00d7 10(8) \u00b1 1.7 mononuclear cells per kilogram were infused. The median time to white blood cell recovery was 18.2 \u00b1 5.34 days. Transplant-related mortality occurred in 10 patients. After a median follow-up period of 104 months, the overall survival rate was 86%. High-dose chemotherapy, followed by autologous stem cell transplant, is an effective treatment option for patients with hematological malignancies, allowing further consolidation of response.","altmetric_jid":"53c3a1df2a83ee055d8b4567","authors":["Ali, Natasha","Adil, Salman Naseem","Shaikh, Mohammad Usman"],"doi":"10.5966\/sctm.2015-0015","first_seen_on":"2015-06-03T11:46:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2157-6564","2157-6580"],"journal":"Stem Cells Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1433331921,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26032748?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/stemcellstm.alphamedpress.org\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/31\/sctm.2015-0015.abstract?papetoc"],"pmid":"26032748","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\u201410 Years of Data From a Developing Country","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autologous-hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation10-years-data-developing-country"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5180928,"mean":6.1198316031113,"rank":3643208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":869006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5180928,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175004,"mean":8.8039800460565,"rank":124239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175004,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":531,"mean":7.7509811320755,"rank":420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":531,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":4.0359574468085,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\u201410 Years of Data From a Developing Country","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=837518509657493&id=104578486284836","license":"public","citation_ids":[4086513],"posted_on":"2015-06-02T10:54:35+00:00","summary":"Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\u201410 Years of Data From a Developing Country http:\/\/bit.ly\/1Gis1uH","author":{"name":"Stem Cells Translational Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/104578486284836","facebook_wall_name":"Stem Cells Translational Medicine","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/104578486284836\/picture","id_on_source":"104578486284836"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/inbraced\/status\/606064122283884544","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4086513],"posted_on":"2015-06-03T11:45:21+00:00","author":{"name":"INBRACED","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/465146281568911360\/OW_wB0Bq_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"inbraced","tweeter_id":"2483933496","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":46},"tweet_id":"606064122283884544"}]}}
