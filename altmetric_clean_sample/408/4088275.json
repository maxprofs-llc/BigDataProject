Patients with joint pain\/stiffness\/swelling were assessed to determine if ANA testing was indicated. An a priori threshold was set before ANA testing would be considered. Those who did not have ANA testing ordered were followed for 1\u00a0year to determine if any of them went on to have a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other connective tissue disease. A parallel study was conducted with a similar a priori threshold for the use of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody testing in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and again, patients were followed for 1\u00a0year. A total of 866 subjects were examined, 509 females (58.8\u00a0%) and 357 males (41.2\u00a0%). The mean age of the group was 47.5\u2009\u00b1\u200916.8\u00a0years. The mean duration of symptoms was 12.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6\u00a0weeks. Of the 866 subjects, 68 met an a priori threshold for ordering ANA, RF, and anti-CCP testing. Of these 68, there was a newly diagnosed case of SLE, 4 newly diagnosed cases of RA, and 3 cases of polymyalgia rheumatica. The remaining 798 subjects were followed for approximately 1\u00a0year and none developed evidence of SLE, RA, or other connective tissue disease. In the evaluation of non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms, setting an a priori threshold for ordering serology in keeping with the spirit of the Canadian Rheumatology Association Choosing Wisely recommendation for antibody testing results in a very low risk of missing a case of systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002579","authors":["Robert Ferrari"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10067-015-2985-z","first_seen_on":"2015-06-03T18:15:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1434-9949"],"journal":"Clinical Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1435248201,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10067-015-2985-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10067-015-2985-z.pdf","pmid":"26032433","pubdate":"2015-06-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer London","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Evaluation of the Canadian Rheumatology Association Choosing Wisely recommendation concerning anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) testing","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-canadian-rheumatology-association-choosing-wisely-recommendation-concerning-antinuclear-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5276531,"mean":6.2120126170061,"rank":1163090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4106842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5276531,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176937,"mean":8.8489927657459,"rank":49940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":126623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176937,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":765,"mean":3.9101701570681,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":765,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":5.3759428571429,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
