Upon binding to specific receptors they lead to the activation of a signal transduction pathway that activates a broad range of genes, that are now known involved not only in antiviral but also in immunomodulatory and antiproliferative activities. The inhibition of virus growth and\/or cell proliferation by interferons is associated with several physiological changes, some of which depend on the activity of specific proteins that are interferon-inducible. This review will attempt to illustrate the history and main properties of the interferon system, taking a look at recent discoveries about some interferon-inducible genes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007363","authors":["De Andrea, Marco","Ravera, Raffaella","Gioia, Daniela","Gariglio, Marisa","Landolfo, Santo"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-03T10:27:54+00:00","issns":["1090-3798"],"journal":"European Journal of Paediatric Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1423568614,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12365360"],"pmid":"12365360","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"The interferon system: an overview.","type":"article","volume":"6 Suppl A","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interferon-system-overview"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4741736,"mean":5.6933955136704,"rank":1148102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3003666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4741736,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165229,"mean":8.7023766673932,"rank":53185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":109014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165229,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":2.1435348837209,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.4166666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
