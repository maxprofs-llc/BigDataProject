Responders as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) were randomly assigned to taper to 25 mg once weekly or continue on 50 mg and followed for a further 6 months. The primary outcome measure was maintenance of a 50% reduction in the BASDAI or fall in BASDAI by \u2265 2 units and a \u2265 2-unit reduction in BASDAI spinal pain as measured on a 10-point visual analog scale at 6 months postrandomization.\nOf 89 patients assessed for eligibility, 59 were enrolled; 47 (80%) had sufficient clinical response and were eligible for randomization, 24 were assigned to continue receiving ETN 50 mg, and 23 to taper to 25 mg. After 6 months, 20 (83%) of the 50 mg arm maintained clinical response compared with 12 (52%) of the 25 mg arm (a difference of -31%, 95% CI -58% - -5%).\nAlthough this pilot study demonstrates that treatment with ETN 25 mg was less effective at maintaining treatment response in the stepdown phase, 52% of participants maintained treatment response. Future research should address which patients are suitable for tapering.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005aa5","authors":["Max Yates","Louise E.
