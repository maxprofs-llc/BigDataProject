In this review, we asked how recent interventional studies addressed 3 theoretical touchstones-relational cultural theory, trauma theory, and addiction theory. We found that few outcomes studies engaged theory directly on any of these points and concluded that the opportunity for field-defining debate may risk getting lost in a quest for numbers or outcomes. We recommended that researchers more explicitly position their work, especially with respect to key theories and points of debate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058dd","authors":["Emerson, Amanda M","Ramaswamy, Megha"],"doi":"10.1097\/fch.0000000000000073","first_seen_on":"2015-06-03T00:23:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1550-5057","0160-6379"],"issue":"3","journal":"Family & Community Health","last_mentioned_on":1433290983,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/familyandcommunityhealth\/Abstract\/2015\/07000\/Theories_and_Assumptions_That_Inform.5.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/familyandcommunityhealth\/Fulltext\/2015\/07000\/Theories_and_Assumptions_That_Inform.5.aspx?utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/familyandcommunityhealth\/2015\/07000\/Theories_and_Assumptions_That_Inform.5.pdf","pmid":"26017002","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"240","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Theories and Assumptions That Inform Trauma-Specific Interventions for Incarcerated Women","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/theories-assumptions-inform-traumaspecific-interventions-incarcerated-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5180561,"mean":6.1095128098145,"rank":3422341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1541522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5180561,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175013,"mean":8.7977752268418,"rank":115908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":50809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175013,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":1.3225224489796,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.55,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
