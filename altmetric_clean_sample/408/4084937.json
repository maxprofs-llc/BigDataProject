As long as the presenting twin is vertex, vaginal delivery should be considered regardless of the presentation of the second twin. To avoid unnecessary cesarean deliveries and maternal morbidity, it is important to continue to train residents to perform obstetrics maneuvers necessary for vaginal delivery of twins such as vaginal breech extraction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002569","authors":["Bibbo, Carolina","Robinson, Julian N"],"doi":"10.1097\/grf.0000000000000105","first_seen_on":"2015-06-03T06:21:19+00:00","issns":["1532-5520","0009-9201"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Obstetrics & Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1438551038,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/clinicalobgyn\/Abstract\/2015\/06000\/Management_of_Twins___Vaginal_or_Cesarean.12.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/clinicalobgyn\/Fulltext\/2015\/06000\/Management_of_Twins___Vaginal_or_Cesarean.12.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/clinicalobgyn\/2015\/06000\/Management_of_Twins___Vaginal_or_Cesarean.12.pdf","pmid":"25851847","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"294","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Management of Twins: Vaginal or Cesarean Delivery?","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-twins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5436647,"mean":6.3270035691119,"rank":2509932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2790003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5436647,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179237,"mean":8.8819801379189,"rank":84395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":88587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179237,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":777,"mean":1.5612319587629,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":777,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.0125,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1,"ES":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ClinObGyn\/status\/620175900760387584","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4084937],"posted_on":"2015-07-12T10:20:31+00:00","author":{"name":"ClinObGyn","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalobgyn.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1593299003\/COG_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Each issue of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology is a complete symposium on one or two timely topics of interest in obstetrics and gynecology.","id_on_source":"ClinObGyn","tweeter_id":"392937980","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1256},"tweet_id":"620175900760387584"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FertilityUpdate\/status\/605982358009987072","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4084937],"posted_on":"2015-06-03T06:20:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Fertility.Update","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/442565627513810944\/isEsCPyy_normal.png","description":"Latest updates related to male as well as female fertility.","id_on_source":"FertilityUpdate","tweeter_id":"2258460362","geo":{"lt":19.07283,"ln":72.88261,"country":"IN"},"followers":362},"tweet_id":"605982358009987072"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gineblog\/status\/627954686868475905","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4084937],"posted_on":"2015-08-02T21:30:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Gineblog","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/604008544418021379\/WuleYdhA_normal.jpg","description":"Our mission to care about women\u2019s health and related issues.
