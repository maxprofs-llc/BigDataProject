The antibacterial activity of nanotechnology products containing different amounts of stabilizing additives when applied to solid pH-neutral substrates is studied. For its evaluation a method making it possible to take into account the capability of nanoparticles to diffuse in solid media was applied. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of nanoparticles used against Erwinia herbicola, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina flava were found. A suggestion was made concerning the influence of the spatial structure of bacteria on the antibacterial activity of colloidal solutions of silver nanoparticles. The data concerning the antibacterial activity and minimal inhibiting concentrations of nanoparticles may be used for development of products suppressing activity of microorganisms hazardous for food production.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c8c","authors":["Balandin, G V","Suvorov, O A","Shaburova, L N","Podkopaev, D O","Frolova, Yu V","Ermolaeva, G A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13197-014-1455-y","first_seen_on":"2015-06-02T12:59:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-1155"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Food Science and Technology","last_mentioned_on":1433249888,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26028773?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26028773","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry\/Food Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nutrition","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"The study of the antimicrobial activity of colloidal solutions of silver nanoparticles prepared using food stabilizers.","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-antimicrobial-activity-colloidal-solutions-silver-nanoparticles-prepared-using-food-stabilizer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5180234,"mean":6.1097096327546,"rank":2738691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1767954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5180234,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174945,"mean":8.8246559013172,"rank":98742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":59041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174945,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333,"mean":1.6493072289157,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":0.8974358974359,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/status\/605720049958031361","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4081762],"posted_on":"2015-06-02T12:58:08+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
