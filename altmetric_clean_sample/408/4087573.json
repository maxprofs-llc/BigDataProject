Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an established technology for cardiopulmonary support with emerging roles in resuscitation. Here, we review the literature of hypokalemic-induced cardiac arrests and discuss one such case successfully managed with ECMO.\nA 23-year-old Central American man who presented to a community ED under federal custody with several days of nausea and vomiting was found to have a serum potassium level of 1.5 mEq\/L. Repeat serum potassium level was 1.1 mEq\/L upon arrival to our facility. Within 2\u00a0h of arrival, despite electrolyte repletion, he suffered cardiac arrest. Advanced cardiac life support was performed for 45\u00a0min. ECMO was initiated while active chest compressions were performed. After aggressive potassium repletion, return of spontaneous circulation was achieved and ECMO was eventually discontinued. Further investigation ultimately confirmed the presence of a potassium-wasting nephropathy, for which the patient had been treated with chronic potassium supplementation prior to entering federal custody. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: ECMO is a well-established modality for cardiopulmonary support, with an emerging role for patients in undifferentiated cardiac arrest presenting to the ED. There is a growing interest in the utility of ECMO in these circumstances. This report highlights hypokalemia as an important cause of cardiac arrest, reviews the treatment and causes of hypokalemia, and demonstrates a potential role for ECMO as a critical temporizing measure to provide time for potassium repletion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d74","authors":["Palatinus, Joseph A","Lieber, Sarah B","Joyce, Katherine E","Richards, Jeremy B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jemermed.2015.02.046","first_seen_on":"2015-06-03T15:40:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0736-4679"],"journal":"Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1433345992,"links":["http:\/\/www.jem-journal.com\/article\/S0736-4679(15)00176-6\/ppt"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jem-journal.com\/article\/S0736467915001766\/pdf","pmid":"26004853","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support for Hypokalemia-induced Cardiac Arrest: A Case Report and Review of\u00a0the Literature","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation-support-hypokalemiainduced-cardiac-arrest-case-report-review-oft"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5180928,"mean":6.1198316031113,"rank":3643208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":869006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5180928,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175005,"mean":8.8039325958265,"rank":124239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175005,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1304,"mean":5.6118296239447,"rank":1032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1304,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":10.196416666667,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/velianton\/status\/606123142210326528","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4087573],"posted_on":"2015-06-03T15:39:52+00:00","author":{"name":"velia marta antonini","url":"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/velianton","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/510026520253849600\/7B76WnqN_normal.jpeg","description":"ICU nurse, ECMO specialist, Cardiovascular Perfusionist & Trainee Cardiac Sonographer #ECMO #ECLS #ECPR #FOAMed #FOANed #FOAMcc #FOAMus","id_on_source":"velianton","tweeter_id":"249568182","geo":{"lt":44.80266,"ln":10.32898,"country":"IT"},"followers":1385},"tweet_id":"606123142210326528"}]}}
