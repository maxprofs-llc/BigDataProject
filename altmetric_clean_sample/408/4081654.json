The reaction is typically carried out at room temperature within 4 h and has a good functional group tolerance. The monofluoromethylating agent, CH2FI, was readily prepared via a halogen-exchange process.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Jingyu Hu"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.orglett.5b01361","first_seen_on":"2015-06-02T12:27:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1523-7052"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1433247993,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.orglett.5b01361"],"pmid":"26024050","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Palladium-Catalyzed Monofluoromethylation of Arylboronic Esters with Fluoromethyl Iodide","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/palladiumcatalyzed-monofluoromethylation-arylboronic-esters-fluoromethyl-iodide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5180561,"mean":6.1095128098145,"rank":3639201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":872103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5180561,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174947,"mean":8.8245429332481,"rank":124345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174947,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3269,"mean":3.3260361077111,"rank":2289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3269,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":2.9795090909091,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
