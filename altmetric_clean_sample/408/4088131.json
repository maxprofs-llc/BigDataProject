Since elimination of the leukemic load is thought to be prerequisite for treatment success, we here investigate toxicity and anti- leukemic activity of a clofarabine-AraC salvage protocol preceding transplantation. In this retrospective analysis, we observed induction of objective remissions in 86% of patients receiving clofarabine-AraC as compared to 83% with sequential high dose AraC\/mitoxantrone (S-HAM) and 50% after mitoxantrone\/topotecane\/AraC (MTC) salvage strategies. In addition, clofarabine conferred anti-leukemic activity to some patients who failed initial MTC or S-HAM therapy. For overall and leukemia-free survival, we identified cytogenetically defined adverse risk markers but not response to therapy to be a strong predictor. In summary, the clofarabine-AraC salvage strategy combines pronounced anti-leukemic activity with an acceptable toxicity profile and allows the majority of patients with relapsed or refractory AML to proceed to allo-SCT, even in cytogenetically defined high risk situations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["Loeffler, Claudia","Kapp, Markus","Grigoleit, Goetz-Ulrich","Mielke, Stephan","Loeffler, J\u00fcrgen","Heuschmann, Peter","Malzahn, Uwe","Hupp, Elke","Einsele, Herman","Stuhler, Gernot"],"doi":"10.3109\/10428194.2015.1020059","first_seen_on":"2015-06-03T17:33:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1029-2403"],"journal":"Leukemia & Lymphoma","last_mentioned_on":1433352693,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10428194.2015.1020059"],"pmid":"26014275","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Control of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia by clofarabine in preparation for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/control-relapsed-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia-clofarabine-preparation-allogeneic-stem-cell-tran-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5180928,"mean":6.1198316031113,"rank":3643208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":869006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5180928,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175005,"mean":8.8039325958265,"rank":124239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175005,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":853,"mean":1.604455399061,"rank":501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":853,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.1866666666667,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Hema_News\/status\/606151245125021696","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4088131],"posted_on":"2015-06-03T17:31:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Hematopoiesis News","url":"http:\/\/www.hematopoiesisnews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748294208570556416\/50mx-B9p_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for the hematopoiesis community.
