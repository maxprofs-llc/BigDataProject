Here we propose to pattern chemical vapor deposition grown graphene film through a stencil mask by magnetic-assisted ultraviolet (UV) ozonation under irradiation of a xenon excimer lamp. In this process, the paramagnetic oxygen molecules and photochemically generated oxygen radicals are magnetized and attracted in an inhomogenous external magnetic field. As a consequence, their random motions convert into directional, which can greatly modify or enhance the quality of graphene patterns. Using a ferromagnetic steel mask, an approximately vertical magnetic-field-assisted UV ozonation (BZ\u2009=\u20090.31\u2009T, \u2207BZ\u2009=\u200990\u2009T\u2009\u00b7\u2009m(-1)) has a capability of patterning graphene microstructures with a line width of 29 \u03bcm and lateral under-oxidation less than 4\u2009\u03bcm. Our approach is applicable to patterning graphene field-effect transistor arrays, and it can be a promising solution toward resist-free, substrate non-damaging, and cost effective microscale patterning of graphene film.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yixuan Wu","Haihua Tao","Shubin Su","Huan Yue","Hao Li","Ziyu Zhang","Zhenhua Ni","Xianfeng Chen"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep46583","first_seen_on":"2017-04-20T14:46:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1493124737,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28422180?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep46583"],"pmid":"28422180","pubdate":"2017-04-20T22:03:26+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Photochemistry","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Graphene","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Chemical physics","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Patterning Graphene Film by Magnetic-assisted UV Ozonation","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patterning-graphene-film-magneticassisted-uv-ozonation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8099079,"mean":6.8881653514065,"rank":1159066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6866211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8099079,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234448,"mean":12.792381433757,"rank":49347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":182770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234448,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33498,"mean":14.890797743082,"rank":8023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":25132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33498,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3329,"mean":18.789943509615,"rank":886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":2411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3329,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TC_papers\/statuses\/855070193956945921","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19210046],"posted_on":"2017-04-20T14:46:35+00:00","author":{"name":"TC_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507539334375829504\/IcPjrJI3_normal.jpeg","description":"Pubmed twitterbot: arealization OR patterning OR somatosensory OR thalamus OR thalamocortical OR cortical development","id_on_source":"TC_papers","tweeter_id":"2789910212","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":179},"tweet_id":"855070193956945921"}],"news":[{"title":"Magnetic-assisted UV Ozonation Method to Pattern Graphene Films","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30350710745&p=1pl&v=1&x=jRlK5LjXSBNehEjN5ByhFg","license":"public","citation_ids":[19210046],"posted_on":"2017-04-25T12:52:17+00:00","summary":"Apr 25 2017 The ability to pattern graphene films has produced a much easier fabrication route for graphene-based elements in many industrial applications, especially optoelectronics.","author":{"name":"Azonano","url":"http:\/\/www.azonano.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/678\/normal\/image.gif?1396869083"}}]}}
