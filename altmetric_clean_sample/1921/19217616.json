Older adults who participated in the workforce were compared with those who did not in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, physical and mental health, and physical functioning and performance in advanced and instrumental activities characteristic of daily living. A multivariate hierarchical logistic regression analysis was performed.\nFactors associated with not participating in the workforce were aged (OR: 1.71, [95% CI: 1.26-2.30], p<0.001), female gender (OR: 1.70, [95% CI: 1.22-2.37], p=0.002), poor visual perception (OR: 1.31, [95% CI: 1.00-1.72], p=0.046), using 4 or more medications regularly (OR: 1.41, [95% CI: 1.489-2.247], p=0.034), having 3 or more comorbidities (OR: 1.44, [95% CI: 1.01-2.04], p=0.040), and a handgrip strength below 24.6kg\/f (18.1-24.6kg\/f (2nd tertile): OR: 1.52, [95% CI: 1.06-2.18], p=0.022; 0-18kg\/f (1st tertile): OR: 1.60, [95% CI: 1.08-2.38], p=0.019). The probability estimates of the final model explained 67.9% of the events related to not participating in the workforce, as observed by the area under the ROC curve.\nOur results highlight that work in later life is influenced by sociodemographic characteristics, intrinsic capacity, and multimorbidity. We suggest that strategies for optimizing healthy and active aging may help older people to continue participating in the workforce and contributing toward their communities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002305","authors":["Renata Gon\u00e7alves Dantas","Monica Rodrigues Perracini","Ricardo Oliveira Guerra","Eduardo Ferriolli","Rosangela Correa Dias","Rosimeire Simprini Padula"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.archger.2017.04.005","first_seen_on":"2017-04-20T20:55:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-6976"],"journal":"Archives of Gerontology & Geriatrics","last_mentioned_on":1492721700,"links":["http:\/\/www.aggjournal.com\/article\/S0167-4943%2817%2930212-1\/abstract#.WPkgIekfIu5.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.aggjournal.com\/article\/S0167494317302121\/pdf","pmid":"28458105","pubdate":"2017-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"What are the sociodemographic and health determinants for older adults continue to participate in work?","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sociodemographic-health-determinants-older-adults-continue-participate-work"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":4275479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2247115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233189,"mean":12.778894754447,"rank":130167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":81869,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233189,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":561,"mean":4.9556285714286,"rank":350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":561,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":4.1273913043478,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lcos3060\/statuses\/855162910028570629","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19217616],"posted_on":"2017-04-20T20:55:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Leo Costa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/864592581484699649\/6_dEBNuq_normal.jpg","description":"Someone who does shitty research for living... #FechadoComOCruzeiro","id_on_source":"lcos3060","tweeter_id":"765987530","geo":{"lt":-23.5475,"ln":-46.63611,"country":"BR"},"followers":480},"tweet_id":"855162910028570629"}]}}
