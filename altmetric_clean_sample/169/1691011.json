DEET, picaridin, tea tree oil, peppermint oil, and citronella oil were tested for repellency to T. rubida and its ability to probe and feed on a small restrained rat. No long range repellency was observed with any of the test materials. The lowest repellent concentrations observed were: 10% DEET, 7% picaridin; 30% tea tree oil, 3.3% peppermint oil, and 0.165% citronella oil. Only citronella oil was able to stop all probing and feeding by T. rubida. Citronella oil appears to be a promising potential repellent to prevent sleeping people from being bitten by kissing bugs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006651","authors":["Terriquez JA","Klotz SA","Meister EA","Klotz JH","Schmidt JO"],"first_seen_on":"2013-08-15T15:59:29+00:00","issns":["0022-2585"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Medical Entomology","last_mentioned_on":1491186490,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23802464","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23802464"],"pmid":"23802464","pubdate":"2013-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Repellency of DEET, picaridin, and three essential oils to Triatoma rubida (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae).","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/repellency-deet-picaridin-three-essential-oils-triatoma-rubida-hemiptera-reduviidae-triatominae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":3572324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4827529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129558,"mean":7.1366525467556,"rank":43173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":85533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129558,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1406,"mean":10.772603558719,"rank":972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1406,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.6932,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/junt_g2643\/statuses\/368039179017404416","license":"public","citation_ids":[1691011],"posted_on":"2013-08-15T15:59:12+00:00","author":{"name":"\u3051\u3093\u304d\u3046\u2606\u30ab\u30b2\u30ad\u56e3","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/649707920632905728\/eceSPd94_normal.jpg","description":"\u300c\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u7684\u300d\u306a\u3093\u305f\u308b\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u304d\u76ee\u7684\u3060\u3089\u3046\u304b  \u300c\u7814\u7a76\u8a08\u753b\u300d\u306a\u3093\u305f\u308b\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u304d\u8a08\u753b\u3060\u3089\u3046\u304b\u3000\u300c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u300d\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u30b1\u30f3\u30ad\u30e5\u30a6\u30b7\u30e3\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1  \u300c\u7814\u7a76\u7d4c\u8cbb\u300d\u3042\u308b\u3060\u3051\u4e0b\u3055\u3044","id_on_source":"junt_g2643","tweeter_id":"727051934","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1849},"tweet_id":"368039179017404416"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/debbieg56171152\/statuses\/848723770445635584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[1691011],"posted_on":"2017-04-03T02:28:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Debbie Gordon","url":"http:\/\/www.hoilistictouch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/488816200730701824\/uzw96m8Z_normal.jpeg","description":"Certified Aromatherapist, Clean Living, Non-toxic alternatives, Aroma Body Applications and  make it yourself!
