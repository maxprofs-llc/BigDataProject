This enzyme contains two AAA(+) domains, one active in the ChlI protein and one inactive in the ChlD protein. Using a series of mutants in the AAA(+) domain of ChlD, we show that this site is essential for magnesium chelation and allosterically regulates Mg(2+) and MgATP(2-) binding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Nathan B.P.
