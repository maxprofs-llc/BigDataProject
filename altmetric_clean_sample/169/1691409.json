However, the functional consequences of the interaction between HIV-1 Tat and abused drugs on behavior are little known. We tested the hypothesis that HIV-1 Tat expression in brain would modulate the psychostimulant effects of cocaine. Using the GT-tg bigenic mouse model, where brain-selective Tat expression is induced by activation of a doxycycline (Dox) promotor, we tested the effects of Tat on cocaine (10\u2009mg\/kg, s.c.) induced locomotion and conditioned place preference (CPP). Compared with uninduced littermates or C57BL\/6J controls, cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion was sustained for a significantly longer duration among Tat-induced mice. Moreover, although all groups displayed similar saline-CPP, Tat-induced GT-tg mice demonstrated a three-fold increase in cocaine-CPP over the response of either uninduced littermates or Dox-treated C57BL\/6J control mice. Induction of Tat also increased the magnitude of a previously established cocaine-CPP after an additional cycle of cocaine place-conditioning. Despite Tat-induced potentiation, extinction of place preference occurred within 21 days, commensurate with cocaine-extinction among saline-treated littermates and C57BL\/6J controls. Re-exposure to cocaine produced reinstatement of an equivalent place preference in Tat-induced GT-tg or C57BL\/6J mice; however, induction of Tat protein after the extinction of CPP also produced reinstatement without additional exposure to cocaine. Together, these data suggest that central HIV-1 Tat expression can potentiate the psychostimulant behavioral effects of cocaine in mice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a7","authors":["Jason J Paris","Amanda N Carey","Christopher F Shay","Stacey M Gomes","Johnny J He","Jay P McLaughlin"],"doi":"10.1038\/npp.2013.201","first_seen_on":"2013-08-15T19:22:17+00:00","issns":["0893-133X","1740-634X"],"journal":"Neuropsychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1434836316,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/NPP.2013.201","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/npp\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/npp2013201a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/npp\/journal\/v39\/n2\/full\/npp2013201a.html"],"pmid":"23945478","pubdate":"2013-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","neurology"],"title":"Effects of Conditional Central Expression of HIV-1 Tat Protein to Potentiate Cocaine-Mediated Psychostimulation and Reward Among Male Mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-conditional-central-expression-hiv1-tat-protein-potentiate-cocainemediated-psychostimulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6231511,"mean":5.9633357285814,"rank":438912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":5789492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6231511,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100670,"mean":7.7997755813608,"rank":9807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":90830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100670,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2852,"mean":9.3816394247632,"rank":436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2852,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":9.7049487179487,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
