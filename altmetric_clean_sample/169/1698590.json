The early-phase PDT effect is coordinated with the late-phase PPTT effect to obtain synergistic anticancer efficiency. The prepared GNS-PEG-Ce6 shows excellent water dispersibility, good biocompatibility, enhanced cellular uptake and remarkable anticancer efficiency upon irradiation in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Wang, Shouju","Huang, Peng","Nie, Liming","Xing, Ruijun","Liu, Dingbin","Wang, Zhe","Lin, Jing","Chen, Shouhui","Niu, Gang","Lu, Guangming","Chen, Xiaoyuan"],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201204623","endpage":"3061","first_seen_on":"2013-08-20T03:09:47+00:00","issns":["1521-4095","0935-9648"],"issue":"22","journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1376968145,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201204623\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibr ary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201204623\/pdf","pmid":"23404693","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"3055","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Single Continuous Wave Laser Induced Photodynamic\/Plasmonic Photothermal Therapy Using Photosensitizer\u00e2\u0080\u0090Functionalized Gold Nanostars","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/single-continuous-wave-laser-induced-photodynamicplasmonic-photothermal-therapy-using-photosensitize"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6393536,"mean":5.9814393821254,"rank":3012089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1914242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6393536,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105468,"mean":7.7932202869145,"rank":51903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":39053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105468,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3196,"mean":10.171012206573,"rank":1791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3196,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":17.629909090909,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
