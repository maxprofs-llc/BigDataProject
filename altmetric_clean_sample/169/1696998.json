Monobromides were synthesized with high efficiency without the need for any additives, catalysts, heating, or inert conditions. Action and absorption spectra suggest that CBr4 absorbs light to give active species for the bromination. The generation of CHBr3 was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS spectrometry analysis, indicating that the present bromination involves the homolytic cleavage of a C-Br bond in CBr4 followed by radical abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007df","authors":["Yuta Nishina"],"doi":"10.3762\/bjoc.9.190","first_seen_on":"2013-08-19T14:50:18+00:00","issns":[""],"journal":"Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1376923725,"links":["http:\/\/www.beilstein-journals.org\/bjoc\/single\/articleFullText.htm?vt=f&publicId=1860-5397-9-190&tpn=0&bpn=latest"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.beilstein-journals.org\/bjoc\/content\/pdf\/1860-5397-9-190.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3778398","pmid":"24062826","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Beilstein-Institut","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Bromination of hydrocarbons with CBr4, initiated by light-emitting diode irradiation","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bromination-hydrocarbons-cbr4-initiated-lightemitting-diode-irradiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9277809930899,"rank":2903075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87505,"mean":7.582590007314,"rank":69894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87505,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":2.3203565891473,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.709,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
