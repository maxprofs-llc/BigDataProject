Previously inaccessible 1,2-azaborine derivatives, including the BN isostere of phenyl phenylacetate and BN1 triphenylmethane were prepared from 5 and characterized. The structural investigation of BN phenyl phenylacetate revealed the presence of a unique NH-carbonyl hydrogen bond that is not present in the corresponding carbonaceous analogue. The methyne CH in BN triphenylmethane was found to be less acidic than the corresponding proton in triphenylmethane. The gram-quantity synthesis of the parent 1,2-azaborine 4 was demonstrated, which enabled the characterization of its boiling point, density, refractive index, and its polarity on the ET(30) scale.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Eric R.
