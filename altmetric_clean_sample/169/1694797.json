A detailed methodology is described to obtain a consistent model of severe SCI. Use of a stereotactic frame and computer controlled impactor allows for creation of reproducible injury. Hypothermia and urinary tract infection pose significant challenges in the post-operative period. Careful monitoring of animals with daily weight recording and bladder expression allows for early detection of post-operative complications. The functional results of this contusion model are equivalent to transection models. The contusion model can be utilized to evaluate the efficacy of both neuroprotective and neuroregenerative approaches.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Vibhor Krishna","Hampton Andrews","Xing Jin","Jin Yu","Abhay Varma","Xuejun Wen","Mark Kindy"],"doi":"10.3791\/50111","first_seen_on":"2013-08-17T18:04:05+00:00","issns":["1940-087X"],"issue":"78","journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1376762563,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/50111\/a-contusion-model-of-severe-spinal-cord-injury-in-rats"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/50111.pdf","pmid":"23979022","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"A Contusion Model of Severe Spinal Cord Injury in Rats","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/50111\/a-contusion-model-of-severe-spinal-cord-injury-in-rats","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contusion-model-severe-spinal-cord-injury-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7047745,"mean":6.2652225778887,"rank":6057800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7047745,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127114,"mean":6.7841513141851,"rank":102791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127114,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3862,"mean":3.0683066563067,"rank":2990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3862,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":5.8178571428571,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/postechlibrary\/statuses\/368795038580346881","license":"public","citation_ids":[1694797],"posted_on":"2013-08-17T18:02:43+00:00","author":{"name":"\ud3ec\uc2a4\ud14d \ubc15\ud0dc\uc900\ud559\uc220\uc815\ubcf4\uad00","url":"http:\/\/library.postech.ac.kr","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/461379319764226048\/KNgeyFqe_normal.jpeg","description":"Tae-Joon Park Digital Library, \ubc15\ud0dc\uc900\ud559\uc220\uc815\ubcf4\uad00, POSTECH","id_on_source":"postechlibrary","tweeter_id":"1965321","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1887},"tweet_id":"368795038580346881"}]}}
