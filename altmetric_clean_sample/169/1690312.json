This study aimed to investigate the effect of antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs) on cardiac function in pediatric epileptic patients using standard and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) echocardiography. This hospital-based, prospective cross-sectional study investigated 52 epileptic children (mean age 9.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1\u00a0years) treated with AEDs (duration 2.4-10.0\u00a0years) and 36 healthy children (mean age 9.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0\u00a0years). In the epilepsy group, standard echocardiography showed increased left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, an increased LV mass index, and preserved ejection fraction. The patients also exhibited increased mitral peak A-wave velocity and mitral E-wave deceleration time as well as a decreased mitral E\/A ratio. The E\/Em ratio was significantly higher in the epilepsy group (5.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2) than in the control group (5.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016). In the epilepsy group, TDI showed an increased isovolumetric relaxation time and myocardial performance index (MPI). It also exhibited decreased early diastolic velocity (Em) and a decreased mitral annular displacement index in these patients. There were positive correlations between the LV lateral wall MPI (r\u00a0=\u00a00.231), septal MPI (r\u00a0=\u00a00.223), and LV mass index (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but no correlation with the duration of AED treatment. The authors detected subclinical ventricular dysfunction associated with AEDs at a preclinical stage. They suggest that TDI can be useful for determining the short- and long-term cardiac effects of AEDs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032aa","doi":"10.1007\/s00246-013-0771-8","first_seen_on":"2013-08-15T10:09:14+00:00","issns":["1432-1971"],"journal":"Pediatric Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1376561342,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23942784?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23942784","pubdate":"2013-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiac Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vascular Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","cardiology"],"title":"Effect of Antiepilepsy Drug Therapy on Ventricular Function in Children With Epilepsy: A Tissue Doppler Imaging Study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-antiepilepsy-drug-therapy-ventricular-function-children-epilepsy-tissue-doppler-imaging-study-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":2902621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85304,"mean":7.5478454685065,"rank":67787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85304,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":460,"mean":1.0233986928105,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":460,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.62391304347826,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CardiologiaF\/statuses\/367951056698761216","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1690312],"posted_on":"2013-08-15T10:09:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiolog\u00eda-Fabumed","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1561758151\/fabumed_normal.png","description":"Cardiolog\u00eda.
