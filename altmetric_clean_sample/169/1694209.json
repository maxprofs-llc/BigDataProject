Consequently, nurses need to consider their role in educating and advising patients about 'safe' drinking limits. This article identifies some of the problems with adhering to such safe drinking limits, for example, the miscalculation of alcohol units. In addition, the article highlights nursing interventions that can be used with all patients, not just those presenting with alcohol-related problems, to increase awareness of the negative effects of harmful alcohol consumption.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f610003213","first_seen_on":"2013-08-17T05:12:22+00:00","issns":["0029-6570"],"issue":"50","journal":"Nursing Standard","last_mentioned_on":1376716308,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23944824?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23944824","pubdate":"2013-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Reducing alcohol-related health risks: the role of the nurse.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reducing-alcoholrelated-health-risks-role-nurse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630009,"mean":4.9312762825916,"rank":2015730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630009,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88039,"mean":7.4674217951341,"rank":45751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":23539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88039,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":379,"mean":1.4569576719577,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":379,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.33625,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
