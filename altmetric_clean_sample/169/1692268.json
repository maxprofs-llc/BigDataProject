The boundary and initial conditions encompass a donor layer, a separating membrane, and an acceptor layer. Alteration of the drug's partition coefficient between donor and separating membrane has little influence on drug accumulation with the acceptor. The diffusivity in the separating membrane should be high to promote a short experimental time to achieve saturation equilibrium in the acceptor layer. The essential parameter to give rapid equilibrium is the thickness of the acceptor polymer film. For values of diffusivity typical for drugs of molecular weight around 500 an acceptor layer thickness of 10 \u00b5m-20 \u00b5m is required to achieve equilibrium within less than 10 d. These simulations allow the selection of suitable experimental conditions to make the 5-layer laminate technique a viable method for routine use.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5653cf058f610004a8d","authors":["Eberhard B\u00e4nsch","Simone Reismann","Geoffrey Lee"],"doi":"10.3109\/10837450.2013.819016","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2013-08-16T03:50:35+00:00","issns":["1083-7450","1097-9867"],"journal":"Pharmaceutical Development & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1376625028,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10837450.2013.819016","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10837450.2013.819016?ai=9is&mi=3j7h3l&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&"],"pmid":"23944998","pubdate":"2013-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Numerical solution for 5-layer laminate technique to determine saturation solubility of a drug in a thin film of pressure sensitive adhesive.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/numerical-solution-5layer-laminate-technique-determine-saturation-solubility-drug-thin-film-pressure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3069874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":946370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82751,"mean":7.9973739697887,"rank":56514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":16170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82751,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197,"mean":0.85142857142857,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.35714285714286,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
