Despite the high cure rates obtained with this drug combination, resistance to arsenic is recently emerging. Moreover, APL patients carrying the PLZF-RAR\u03b1 fusion protein are partially resistant to ATRA treatment. HIF-1\u03b1 activation has been recently reported in APL, and EZN-2208 (PEG-SN38) is a compound with HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitory function currently tested in clinical trials. This study investigates the effect of EZN-2208 in different pre-clinical APL models, either alone or in combination with ATRA.\nEfficacy of EZN-2208 in APL was measured in vitro by assessing expression of HIF-1\u03b1 target genes, cell migration, clonogenicity and differentiation, vis a vis the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of this compound. In vivo, EZN-2208 was used in mouse models of APL driven by PML-RAR\u03b1 or PLZF-RAR\u03b1, either alone or in combination with ATRA.\nTreatment of APL cell lines with non-cytotoxic doses of EZN-2208 causes dose-dependent down-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 bona fide target genes and affects cell migration and clonogenicity in methylcellulose. In vivo, EZN-2208 impairs leukemia progression and prolongs mice survival in APL mouse models. More importantly, when used in combination with ATRA, EZN-2208 synergizes in de-bulking leukemia and eradicating leukemia initiating cells.\nOur pre-clinical data suggest that the combination ATRA-EZN-2208 may be tested to treat APL patients who develop resistance to ATO or patients carrying the PLZF-RAR\u03b1 fusion protein.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Nadia Coltella","Roberta Valsecchi","Manfredi Ponente","Maurilio Ponzoni","Rosa Bernardi"],"doi":"10.1158\/1078-0432.ccr-14-3022","first_seen_on":"2015-05-01T12:18:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-3265","1078-0432"],"journal":"Clinical Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1431415438,"links":["http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/04\/30\/1078-0432.CCR-14-3022.abstract?papetoc=","http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/04\/30\/1078-0432.CCR-14-3022.long","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25931453?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/clincancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/04\/30\/1078-0432.CCR-14-3022.full.pdf","pmid":"25931453","pubdate":"2015-05-02T22:01:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Synergistic leukemia eradication by combined treatment with retinoic acid and HIF inhibition by EZN-2208 (PEG-SN38) in preclinical models of PML-RAR\u03b1 and PLZF-RAR\u03b1 driven leukemia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synergistic-leukemia-eradication-combined-treatment-retinoic-acid-hif-inhibition-ezn2208-pegsn38-pre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5090406,"mean":6.0304841555845,"rank":1863142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3202455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5090406,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157305,"mean":9.6238966332707,"rank":56395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":99803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157305,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4291,"mean":4.1848051282051,"rank":1581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4291,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219,"mean":3.714128440367,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
