Compound 1 is a useful starting material for low-coordinate (IPr)Co species. 1 reacts with 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT-H) via aminolysis of the Co-N bond to generate a three-coordinate phenoxide complex, IPrCoCl(O-2,6-(t)Bu2-4-MeC6H2) (2). The reaction of 1 with 2,6-diisopropylaniline (NH2DIPP) generates IPrCoCl(NHDIPP) (4), which undergoes disproportionation to form a mixture of 4, {IPrCoCl2}2, and IPrCo(NHDIPP)2 (3). The same product mixture is formed by the reaction of 1 with Li[NH(DIPP)], which unexpectedly proceeds by amide exchange. Compound 3 was synthesized independently by the reaction of {IPrCoCl2}2 with 4 equiv of Li[NH(DIPP)]. The reaction of 1 with the bulkier lithium 2,6-dimesitylanilide (LiNHDMP) also proceeds by amide exchange to generate IPrCoCl(NHDMP) (5), which is stable toward disproportionation. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit trigonal-planar geometries at cobalt in the solid state. The solid-state structure of 3 also contains a trigonal-planar cobalt center and exhibits close Co---H contacts involving the methine hydrogen atoms of the NH(DIPP) groups in the axial positions. The solid-state structure of 5 features an interaction between cobalt and a flanking aryl group of the anilide ligand, resulting in pyramidalization of the cobalt center.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Christopher B.
