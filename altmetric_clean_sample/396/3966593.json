In this work, a method based on DART\/Q-TOF MS\/MS has been developed for rapid identification of dicyandiamide (DCD) present in powdered milk. Simple sample extraction procedure employing acetonitrile-water (80:20, v\/v) mixture was followed by direct, high-throughput determination of sample extracts spread on a steel mesh of the transmission module by mass spectrometry under ambient conditions. The method has been evaluated for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of DCD in powdered milk. Variables including experimental apparatus, DART gas heater temperature, sample presentation speed, and vacuum pressure were investigated. The quantitative method was validated with respect to linearity, sensitivity, repeatability, precision, and accuracy by using external standards. After optimization of these parameters, a limit of detection (LOD) of 100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg(-1) was obtained for DCD with a linear working range from 100 to 10000\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg(-1) and a satisfactory correlation coefficient (R(2)) of 0.9997. Good recovery (80.08%-106.47%) and repeatability (RSD\u2009=\u20093.0%-5.4%) were achieved for DCD. The DART\/Q-TOF MS\/MS-based method provides a rapid, efficient, and powerful scheme to analyze DCD in powdered milk with limited sample preparation, thus reducing time and complexity of quality control.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5d","authors":["Liya Zhang","Wei Yong","Jiahui Liu","Sai Wang","Qilong Chen","Tianyang Guo","Jichuan Zhang","Tianwei Tan","Haijia Su","Yiyang Dong"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13361-015-1142-x","first_seen_on":"2015-05-04T16:59:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1123"],"journal":"Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry","last_mentioned_on":1430758750,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s13361-015-1142-x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs13361-015-1142-x.pdf","pmid":"25930094","pubdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
