Formalin (0.5%) was used to produce hyperalgesia in non-diabetic and diabetic rats. von Frey filaments were used to determine the 50% withdrawal threshold in diabetic rats.\nOral administration of celecoxib (0.3-30mg\/kg) reduced formalin-induced nociceptive behavior during phase 2. Systemic pre-treatment (-10min) with naltrexone (3mg\/kg) prevented celecoxib-induced antihyperalgesia in formalin-treated diabetic rats. Furthermore, naltrexone as well as the \u03b4 and \u03ba opioid receptor antagonists naltrindole (3mg\/kg) and 5'-guanidino naltrindole (1mg\/kg), respectively, fully prevented celecoxib-induced antihyperalgesia (10mg\/kg) in formalin-treated non-diabetic and diabetic rats. Furthermore, celecoxib (0.3-30mg\/kg) produced an antiallodynic effect in diabetic rats. Pre-treatment with naltrexone (3mg\/kg) fully prevented the antiallodynic effect of celecoxib at 0.3, 3 and 10mg\/kg. In contrast, this dose of naltrexone only partially prevented the antiallodynic effect of celecoxib 30mg\/kg. Naltrexone and naltrindole (3mg\/kg), but not 5'-guanidino naltrindole (1mg\/kg), fully prevented the antiallodynic effect of celecoxib in diabetic rats.\nData suggest that celecoxib produces an antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effect in diabetic rats. These effects seem to result from activation of \u03bc, \u03b4 and \u03ba opioid receptors for antinociception and \u03bc and \u03b4 for antiallodynia. Celecoxib could be useful to treat neuropathic pain in diabetic patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100084db","authors":["Ju\u00e1rez-Rojop, Isela E","Morales-Hern\u00e1ndez, Paulina E","Tovilla-Z\u00e1rate, Carlos A","Berm\u00fadez-Oca\u00f1a, Deysi Y","Torres-Lopez, Jorge E","Ble-Castillo, Jorge L","D\u00edaz-Zagoya, Juan C","Granados-Soto, Vinicio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pharep.2014.12.006","first_seen_on":"2015-05-05T05:37:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1734-1140"],"issue":"3","journal":"Pharmacological Reports","last_mentioned_on":1430804263,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25933968?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25933968","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Celecoxib reduces hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia in diabetic rats.","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/celecoxib-reduces-hyperalgesia-tactile-allodynia-diabetic-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5559823,"mean":6.3848005267094,"rank":4629712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5559823,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167328,"mean":9.458150866268,"rank":139385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167328,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":348,"mean":1.6111181556196,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":348,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.5004,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
