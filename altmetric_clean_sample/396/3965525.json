Rates for hypertension-related death increased for both sexes aged 45-64 and 85 and over from 2000 through 2013. The age-adjusted hypertension-related death rate increased for all Hispanic origin and race groups examined from 2000 through 2005. Since then, the rate for the non-Hispanic white population continued to increase, whereas the rate for the non-Hispanic black population decreased. Although the age-adjusted hypertension-related death rate for the non-Hispanic black population was higher than for the non-Hispanic white and Hispanic populations throughout the period, the gap between them narrowed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccba","authors":["Kung, Hsiang-Ching","Xu, Jiaquan"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-04T07:13:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1941-4927"],"issue":"193","journal":"NCHS data brief","last_mentioned_on":1430723569,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25932893?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25932893","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Hypertension-related Mortality in the United States, 2000-2013.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypertensionrelated-mortality-united-states-20002013"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5056368,"mean":5.9809452245076,"rank":3548720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":850474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5056368,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157018,"mean":9.4344068476663,"rank":113699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":26008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157018,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":5.1660789473684,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
