However, problems of the S cathode such as highly soluble intermediate species (polysulfides Li2Sn, n = 4-8) and the insulating nature of S cause poor cycle life and low utilization of S, which prevent the practical use of Li\/S cells. Here, a high-rate and long-life Li\/S cell is proposed, which has a cathode material with a core-shell nano-structure comprising Li2S nano-spheres with an embedded graphene oxide (GO) sheet as a core material and a conformal carbon layer as a shell. The conformal carbon coating is easily obtained by a unique CVD coating process using a lab-designed rotating furnace without any repetitive steps. The Li2S\/GO@C cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 650 mA\u22c5h g-1 of Li2S (corresponding to the 942 mA\u22c5h g-1 of S) and very low capacity decay rate of only 0.046 % per cycle with a high Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.7 % for 1500 cycles when cycled at the 2 C discharge rate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Yoon Hwa"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.nanolett.5b00820","first_seen_on":"2015-05-01T11:25:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-6992"],"journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1430474400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.5b00820"],"pmid":"25915431","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Lithium Sulfide (Li2S)\/Graphene Oxide Nanospheres with Conformal Carbon Coating as a High-Rate, Long-Life Cathode for Li\/S Cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lithium-sulfide-liinf2infsgraphene-oxide-nanospheres-conformal-carbon-coating-highrate-longlife-cath"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.888,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.888},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5045006,"mean":5.9752110334897,"rank":748800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":4295602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5045006,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155864,"mean":9.6107611043033,"rank":33928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":121911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155864,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3332,"mean":11.003335334734,"rank":1300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3332,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":6.9107540983607,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
