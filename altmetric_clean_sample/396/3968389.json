In normal circumstances, motor adaptation corrects for movements' inaccuracies and as such, it is critical in maintaining optimal motor control. However, motor adaptation performance is also known to decline with age. Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) of the cerebellum and the primary motor cortex (M1) have been found to improve visuomotor adaptation in healthy young and older adults. However, no study directly has compared the effect of TDCS on motor adaptation between the two age populations. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the application of anodal TDCS over the lateral cerebellum and M1 affected motor adaptation in young and older adults similarly. Young and older participants performed a visuomotor rotation task and concurrently received TDCS over the left M1, the right cerebellum or received sham stimulation. Our results replicated the finding that older adults are impaired compared to the young adults in visuomotor adaptation. At the end of the adaptation session, older adults displayed a larger error (-17\u00b0) than the young adults (-10\u00b0). The stimulation of the lateral cerebellum did not change the adaptation in both age groups. Contrarily, anodal TDCS over M1 improved initial adaptation in either age groups by around 30% compared to sham and this improvement lasted up to 40 minutes after the end of the stimulation. These results demonstrate that TDCS of M1 can enhance visuomotor adaptation, via mechanisms that remain available in the ageing population. This article is protected by copyright.
