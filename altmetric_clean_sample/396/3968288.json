However, development of these interventions is a complex process and poses unique challenges. Usability testing, which assesses the ability of individuals to use an application successfully, can have a significant impact on the quality of a self-help intervention. This article describes (a) the development of a novel web-based multi-module self-help intervention for disaster-affected adolescents and their parents and (b) a mixed-methods formal usability study to evaluate user response. A total of 24 adolescents were observed, videotaped, and interviewed as they used the depressed mood component of the self-help intervention. Quantitative results indicated an above-average user experience, and qualitative analysis identified 120 unique usability issues. We discuss the challenges of developing self-help applications, including design considerations and the value of usability testing in technology-based interventions, as well as our plan for widespread dissemination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029bf","authors":["Yuen, Erica K","Gros, Kirstin","Welsh, Kyleen E","McCauley, Jenna","Resnick, Heidi S","Danielson, Carla K","Price, Matthew","Ruggiero, Kenneth J"],"doi":"10.1177\/1460458215579292","first_seen_on":"2015-05-05T06:39:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-2811"],"journal":"Health Informatics Journal","last_mentioned_on":1430919939,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25933798\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25933798","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25933798?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25933798","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Development and preliminary testing of a web-based, self-help application for disaster-affected families.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-preliminary-testing-webbased-selfhelp-application-disasteraffected-families"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5064760,"mean":6.0008712813393,"rank":899810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":4160247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5064760,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157331,"mean":9.4692458780907,"rank":39357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":117716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157331,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":2.4601224489796,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
