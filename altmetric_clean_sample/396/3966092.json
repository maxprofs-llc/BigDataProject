Unfortunately, no satisfying revision method with acceptable survivorship 10\u00a0years after revision has been described for these patients so far.\nThe purposes of this study were to (1) analyze the clinical outcome; (2) complication rate; (3) survivorship; and (4) radiographic outcome of cemented revision THA performed with impaction bone grafting (IBG) on both the acetabular and femoral sides in one surgery in patients younger than 55\u00a0years old.\nDuring the period 1991 to 2007, 86 complete THA revisions were performed at our institution in patients younger than 55\u00a0years. In 34 of these 86 revisions (40%), IBG was used on both the acetabular and femoral sides in 33 patients. Mean patient age at revision surgery was 46.4\u00a0years (SD 7.6). No patient was lost to followup, but three patients died during followup. None of the deaths were related to the revision surgery. The mean followup for the surviving hips was 11.7\u00a0years (SD 4.6). We also analyzed complication rate.\nThe mean Harris hip score improved from 55 (SD 18) preoperatively to 80 points (SD 16) at latest followup (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Six hips underwent a rerevision (18%): in four patients, both components were rerevised; and in two hips, only the cup was revised. Patient 10-year survival rate with the endpoint of rerevision for any component for any reason was 87% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67%-95%) and with the endpoint of rerevision for aseptic loosening, the survival rate was 97% (95% CI, 80%-100%). In total six cups were considered radiographically loose, of which four were rerevised. Three stems were radiographically loose, of which none was rerevised.\nIBG is a valuable biological revision technique that may restore bone stock in younger patients. Bone stock reconstruction is important, because these patients likely will outlive their revision implants. Bone reconstruction with impaction grafting may facilitate future revisions.\nLevel IV, therapeutic study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256d","authors":["Martijn A. J. te Stroet","Wim H. C.
