The aim of this study was to adjust autophagy with pharmacologic agents to determine its functional significance in I\/R-induced lung injury.\nHuman pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) and mice were pre-conditioned with autophagy inhibitor chloroquine or promoter rapamycin before they were challenged with oxygen-glucose deprivation\/oxygen-glucose restoration (OGD) and lung I\/R, respectively. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1\/2 inhibitor U0126 was pre-injected into I\/R-induced mice to test the role of ERK1\/2 in regulating autophagy.\nOGD caused tight conjunction damage and cell death in HPMVECs, which was further aggravated by blocking autophagy, yet ameliorated through promoting autophagy. On a consistent basis, inhibiting autophagy aggravated I\/R-induced lung edema and tissue inflammation, which was significantly alleviated by promoting autophagy with rapamycin. In addition, inhibition of ERK1\/2 increased expression of active mammalian target-of-rapamycin and thus decreased I\/R-induced autophagy.\nIt appears that autophagy plays a protective role in I\/R-induced lung injury and this effect may be enhanced by moderately improving autophagy level. Meanwhile, the ERK1\/2 signal pathway has a positively regulating role in lung I\/R-induced autophagy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd6","authors":["Zhang, Dan","Li, Chichi","Zhou, Jian","Song, Yuanlin","Fang, Xiaocong","Ou, Jiaxian","Li, Jing","Bai, Chunxue"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.healun.2014.12.008","first_seen_on":"2015-05-04T08:25:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-3117"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Heart & Lung Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1430647331,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25934479?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25934479?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25934479","pubdate":"2015-05-04T22:00:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Autophagy protects against ischemia\/reperfusion-induced lung injury through alleviating blood-air barrier damage.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autophagy-protects-against-ischemiareperfusioninduced-lung-injury-through-alleviating-bloodair-barri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5051149,"mean":5.9762426292023,"rank":4201310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5051149,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156916,"mean":9.4343801293696,"rank":130924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156916,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":2.5425620608899,"rank":329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.7666666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AutophagyPapers\/status\/594804134538121217","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3965641],"posted_on":"2015-05-03T10:02:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Autophagy Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559405603697590273\/EoGNUIXe_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for #Autophagy papers.
