Continued Dispensing (CD) is a new medication supply method for certain medications in Australia. It aims to prevent treatment interruption as a result of patients' inability to obtain a new valid prescription. The only currently eligible patients for this service are statin and\/or oral contraceptives users who have been using these medications for 6 months or more, have not utilized the CD method during the last 12 months, and cannot obtain an immediate appointment with the prescriber in order to get a new prescription. This study aimed to investigate patients' attitudes towards potential extension and expansion of this medication supply method. Methods. A randomly selected 301 users of these medications from all Australian States were recruited using Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI). Result. The response rate was 79%. The majority of the participants (73.3%) did not agree with current restriction on CD utilization frequency. They also supported, to varying degrees, inclusion of all the proposed medications (support ranged from 44.2-78.4%). In this regard, participants who suffered from a specific disease did not differ significantly from those without the disease except in case of patients with depression (p = 0.001). Conclusions. Participants of this study strongly supported both CD extension and expansion. A future critical review of the current version of CD is highly recommended in order to enhance CD capability to achieve its goals.","altmetric_jid":"521f51273cf0582f62000000","authors":["Salem Hasn Abukres","Kreshnik Hoti","Jeffery David Hughes"],"doi":"10.7717\/peerj.924","first_seen_on":"2015-05-05T08:03:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2167-8359"],"journal":"PeerJ","last_mentioned_on":1447661896,"links":["https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/924\/","http:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/924\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7717\/peerj.924","https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/924\/?td=tw"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/924.pdf","pmid":"26019994","pubdate":"2015-05-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","title":"Continued Dispensing: what medications do patients believe should be available?","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/924","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/continued-dispensing-medications-patients-believe-available"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6574363,"mean":6.0951058539218,"rank":1407824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5141496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6574363,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173727,"mean":9.4537667361249,"rank":54026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":119012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173727,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2657,"mean":20.329311746988,"rank":1467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2657,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":32.302197802198,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
