As resting state gamma activity measures functional brain connectivity, it could be used as a specific treatment marker.\nTo investigate the effect of cerebellar-rTMS on resting state gamma activity, while studying its efficacy in recent onset schizophrenia patients.\nThis rater-blinded prospective study was completed by 11 schizophrenia patients. They received 10 sessions of high-frequency (theta patterned) rTMS to midline cerebellum over 2 weeks. Resting state EEG was recorded using high (192-channel) resolution EEG at baseline and post rTMS. Gamma spectral power was calculated using fast Fourier transformation, Hanning window averaged over 8 scalp segments corresponding 8 lobes. Clinical improvement rated on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and depressive symptoms assessed using the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia were other outcome variables. Nonparametric statistics were used.\nOver the treatment course, significant reduction was seen on negative syndrome and depression scores. Gamma spectral power in left frontal and temporal segments reduced significantly. Spearman correlation analysis showed that percentage reduction in psychopathology scores had significant positive correlation with percentage reduction in gamma spectral power.\nCerebellar-rTMS might be an effective adjunct to treat intricate and lingering negative and affective symptoms. Resting state gamma spectral power in frontal and temporal regions might be used as a biomarker for treatment response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c4f","authors":["Tikka, Sai Krishna","Garg, Shobit","Sinha, Vinod Kumar","Nizamie, S Haque","Goyal, Nishant"],"doi":"10.1097\/yct.0000000000000242","first_seen_on":"2015-05-02T10:05:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-4112","1095-0680"],"issue":"4","journal":"The Journal of ECT","last_mentioned_on":1472554462,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ectjournal\/9000\/00000\/Resting_State_Dense_Array_Gamma_Oscillatory.99499.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25923998?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ectjournal\/Abstract\/2015\/12000\/Resting_State_Dense_Array_Gamma_Oscillatory.12.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ectjournal\/Fulltext\/2015\/12000\/Resting_State_Dense_Array_Gamma_Oscillatory.12.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ectjournal\/9000\/00000\/Resting_State_Dense_Array_Gamma_Oscillatory.99499.pdf","pmid":"25923998","pubdate":"2015-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Resting State Dense Array Gamma Oscillatory Activity as a Response Marker for Cerebellar-Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in Schizophrenia","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resting-state-dense-array-gamma-oscillatory-activity-response-marker-cerebellarrepetitive-transcrani"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":4419478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2310951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207286,"mean":8.9731371493355,"rank":113991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":72599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207286,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":906,"mean":1.7152044198895,"rank":354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":906,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.864,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
