Interleukin (IL)-15 is critical in antiviral immune responses. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling plays an important role in tissue maintenance and repair, particularly in the lung. We studied RA signaling and its relation to IL-15 in the lung during cigarette smoke (CS) exposure and influenza virus infection. In vivo studies show that RA signaling is diminished by long-term CS exposure or influenza virus infection alone, which is further attenuated during infection following CS exposure. RA receptor \u03b2 (RAR\u03b2) is specifically decreased in the lung of IL-15 transgenic (overexpression; IL-15Tg) mice, and a greater reduction in RAR\u03b2 is found in these mice compared with wild type (WT) after infection. RAR\u03b2 is increased in IL-15 knockout (IL-15KO) mice compared with WT after infection and the additive effect of CS and virus on RAR\u03b2 downregulation is diminished in IL-15KO mice. IL-15 receptor \u03b1 (IL-15R\u03b1) is increased and RAR\u03b2 is significantly decreased in lung interstitial macrophages from IL-15Tg mice compared with WT. In vitro studies show that IL-15 downregulates RAR\u03b2 in macrophages via IL-15R\u03b1 signaling during influenza virus infection. These studies suggest that RA signaling is significantly diminished in the lung by CS exposure and influenza virus infection. IL-15 specifically downregulates RAR\u03b2 expression and RAR\u03b2 may play a protective role in lung injury caused by CS exposure and viral infections.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698a","authors":["Dr. Jianmiao Wang "],"doi":"10.1165\/rcmb.2014-0448oc","first_seen_on":"2015-05-04T15:38:01+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1535-4989"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1490000523,"links":["http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1165\/rcmb.2014-0448OC?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&","http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1165\/rcmb.2014-0448OC#.VU_IiJOGMg4","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1165\/rcmb.2014-0448OC","http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1165\/rcmb.2014-0448OC","http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1165\/rcmb.2014-0448OC#.VUffbL63nq1","http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/full\/10.1165\/rcmb.2014-0448OC"],"pmid":"25923039","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Interleukin-15 Regulates Retinoic Acid Receptor Beta in the Lung During Cigarette Smoking and Influenza Virus Infection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-retinoic-acid-receptor-beta-interleukin15-lung-during-cigarette-smoking-influenza-virus-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":37.75,"score_history":{"1y":4,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":37.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":246497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8142740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208183,"mean":8.9213770835136,"rank":8952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":199219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208183,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1148,"mean":3.0338936355711,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":1139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1148,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.0125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
