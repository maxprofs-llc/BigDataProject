All patients underwent evaluation of the variables incorporated in the FACED score (FEV1 % predicted, age, chronic colonization by Pseudomaonas aeruginosa, radiological extent of the disease, and dyspnea) and in the BSI (age, body mass index, FEV1 % predicted, hospitalization and exacerbations in previous year, dyspnea, chronic colonization by Pseudomaonas aeruginosa and other microrganisms, and radiological extent of the disease).\nAccording to the value of the derived overall FACED score we found 17 patients (45.9%) with mild bronchiectasis, 14 patients (37.8%) with moderate bronchiectasis and 6 patients (16.2%) with severe bronchiectasis. The mean derived FACED score was 3.4 \u00b1 1.3. In addition, according to the value of the derived overall BSI score, the frequency of patients with low, intermediate and high BSI score was 16 patients (43,2%), 14 patients (37.8%) and 7 patients (18.9%), respectively. The mean derived BSI score was 6.4 \u00b1 2.5.\nWe found similar results by the assessment of the NCFB severity in regard to its prognosis by both the FACED score and the BSI. Further studies determining how these scores may impact clinical practice are needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f610004347","authors":["J Minov","J Karadzinska-Bislimovska","K Vasilevska","S Stoleski","D Mijakoski"],"doi":"10.2174\/1874306401509010046","first_seen_on":"2015-05-01T12:54:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1874-3064"],"journal":"Open Respiratory Medicine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1430481619,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4397824"],"pmid":"25893025","pubdate":"2015-05-01T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"Bentham Science Publishers","startpage":"46","title":"Suppl 1: M3:  Assessment of the Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis  Severity: The FACED Score vs the Bronchiectasis  Severity Index","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-noncystic-fibrosis-bronchiectasis-severity-faced-score-vs-bronchiectasis-severity-index"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5044953,"mean":5.9751374954631,"rank":706129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":4300531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5044953,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155864,"mean":9.6107251753144,"rank":32221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":122154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155864,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":3.8526666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
