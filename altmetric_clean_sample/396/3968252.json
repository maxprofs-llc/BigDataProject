When hypomorphic mutant Myb mice (MybPlt4) were examined it was noted that Cyclin E1 (Ccne1) expression was reduced. Furthermore, the induction of Ccne1 in recovering intestinal epithelia following radiation-induced damage was ablated in Myb mutant mice. These data prompted us to investigate whether Myb directly regulated Ccne1 and to examine whether elevated Myb in colorectal cancer (CRC) is responsible for Cyclin E1-driven tumor growth. Here it was found that Myb\/MYB and Ccne1\/CCNE1 expression were coupled in both mouse and human adenomas. In addition, the low molecular weight Cyclin E1 was the predominant form in intestinal crypts and Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc)-mutant adenomas. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis confirmed that Myb bound directly to the Ccne1 promoter and regulated its endogenous expression. By contrast, MybPlt4 served as a dominant negative factor that inhibited wild type Myb and this was not apparently compensated for by the transcription factor E2F1 in intestinal epithelial cells. MybPlt4\/Plt4 mice died prematurely on an ApcMin\/+ background associated with hematopoietic defects including a myelodysplasia, nevertheless ApcMin\/+ mice were protected from intestinal tumorigenesis when crossed to MybPlt4\/+ mice. Knockdown (KD) of Cyclin E1 transcript in murine CRC cells stabilized chromosome ploidy and decreased tumor formation. These data suggest that Cyclin E1 expression is Myb-dependent in normal and transformed intestinal epithelial cells consistent with a cell cycle progression and chromosome instability role in cancer.\nThis study demonstrates that Myb regulates Cyclin E1 expression in normal gastrointestinal tract epithelial cells and is required during intestinal tumorigenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081df","authors":["Cheasley, Dane","Pereira, Lloyd","Sampurno, Shienny","Sieber, Oliver","Jorissen, Robert","Xu, Huiling","Germann, Markus","Yuqian, Yan","Malaterre, Jordane","Ramsay, Robert G","D.
