Upon agonist binding, these receptors accelerate the exchange of GDP for GTP in G proteins coupled to them. The activated G protein interacts with effector proteins to implement downstream biological functions. Objective: We present a kinetic, quaternary complex model, based on a system of coupled linear first-order differential equations, which accounts for the binding attributes of the ligand, receptor, G protein and two types of guanine nucleotide (GDP and GTP) as well as for GTPase activity. Methods: We solved the model numerically to predict the extents of G protein activation, receptor occupancy by ligand and receptor coupling that result from varying the ligand concentration, presence of GDP and\/or GTP, the ratio of G protein to receptor and the equilibrium constants governing receptor pre-coupling and constitutive activity. We also simulated responses downstream from G protein activation using a transducer function. Results: Our model shows that agonist-induced G protein activation can occur with either a net decrease or increase in total receptor-G protein coupling. In addition, we demonstrate that affinity constants of the ligand for both the active and inactive states of the receptor can be derived to a close approximation from analysis of simulated responses downstream from receptor activation. Discussion and conclusion: The latter result validates our prior methods for estimating the active state affinity constants of ligands, and our results on receptor coupling have relevance to studies investigating receptor-G protein interactions using fluorescence techniques.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040c4","authors":["Richard S L Stein","Frederick J Ehlert"],"doi":"10.3109\/10799893.2014.975250","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T01:33:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-4281"],"journal":"Journal of Receptor & Signal Transduction Research","last_mentioned_on":1414718931,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25353707?dopt=Abstract&holding=f1000,f1000m&tool=cdl&otool=cdlotool"],"pmid":"25353707","pubdate":"2014-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","physiology","biochemistry"],"title":"A kinetic model of GPCRs: analysis of G protein activity, occupancy, coupling and receptor-state affinity constants.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kinetic-model-gpcrs-analysis-g-protein-activity-occupancy-coupling-receptorstate-affinity-constants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4198883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143707,"mean":8.7148906099956,"rank":115304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143707,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":0.69218439716312,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.48,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
