Polarization switching by an applied field is a complex phenomenon which depends on the initial domain ordering, defect concentration, electrical boundary conditions and charge screening. Injected free charge may also to be used to reversibly switch in-plane polarized domains. We show that the interaction between the initial domain order and the bulk screening provided by very low energy electrons switches the polarization without the collateral radiation damage which occurs when employing a beam of high energy electrons. Polarization switching during charge injection adds a new dimension to the multifunctionality of ferroelectric oxides.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["J.
