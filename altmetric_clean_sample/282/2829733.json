With the continuing human outbreak of H5N1 beginning in 2003 and the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, focus on influenza and other respiratory viruses has been increased. It has been accepted for decades that international travel via jet aircraft is a major vector for global spread of influenza, and epidemiological differences between tropical and temperate regions observed. Thus we wanted to study how indoor environmental conditions (enclosed locations) in the tropics and winter temperate zones contribute to the aerosol spread of influenza by travelers. To this end, a survey consisting of 632 readings of temperature (T) versus relative humidity (RH) in 389 different enclosed locations air travelers are likely to visit in 8 tropical nations were compared to 102 such readings in 2 Australian cities, including ground transport, hotels, shops, offices and other publicly accessible locations, along with 586 time course readings from aircraft.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a9","doi":"10.1186\/1743-422x-7-98","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T03:15:09+00:00","issns":["1743-422X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Virology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1414347510,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1743-422X-7-98.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/pdf\/1743-422X-7-98.pdf","pmid":"20470403","pubdate":"2010-05-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"98","title":"Aerosol influenza transmission risk contours: A study of humid tropics versus winter temperate zone","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aerosol-influenza-transmission-risk-contours-study-humid-tropics-versus-winter-temperate-zone"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520599,"mean":6.5027232023268,"rank":1645083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5861009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520599,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199002,"mean":7.8010669594628,"rank":47981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":150533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199002,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1572,"mean":3.3593150859325,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1572,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":3.88425,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
