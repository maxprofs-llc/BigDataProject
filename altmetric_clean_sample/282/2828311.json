We characterized two immunodominant CD8 T cell populations generated in response to immunization of BALB\/c mice with a replication-deficient adenovirus serotype 5 vector expressing the HIV-derived Gag and Pol proteins at equivalent levels. The Gag-AI9\/H-2K(d) epitope elicited high-avidity CD8 T cell populations with architecturally diverse clonotypic repertoires that displayed potent lytic activity in vivo. In contrast, the Pol-LI9\/H-2D(d) epitope elicited motif-constrained CD8 T cell repertoires that displayed lower levels of physical avidity and lytic activity despite equivalent measures of overall clonality. Although low-dose vaccination enhanced the functional profiles of both epitope-specific CD8 T cell populations, greater polyfunctionality was apparent within the Pol-LI9\/H-2D(d) specificity. Higher proportions of central memory-like cells were present after low-dose vaccination and at later time points. However, there were no noteworthy phenotypic differences between epitope-specific CD8 T cell populations across vaccine doses or time points. Collectively, these data indicate that the functional and phenotypic properties of vaccine-induced CD8 T cell populations are sensitive to dose manipulation, yet constrained by epitope specificity in a clonotype-dependent manner.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Brenna J Hill","Patricia A Darrah","Zachary Ende","David R Ambrozak","Kylie M Quinn","Sam Darko","Emma Gostick","Linda Wooldridge","Hugo A van den Berg","Vanessa Venturi","Martin Larsen","Miles P Davenport","Robert A Seder","David A Price","Daniel C Douek","Hill BJ","Darrah PA","Ende Z","Ambrozak DR","Quinn KM","Darko S","Gostick E","Wooldridge L","van den Berg HA","Venturi V","Larsen M","Davenport MP","Seder RA","Price DA","Douek DC"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1401017","endpage":"5636","first_seen_on":"2014-10-30T21:40:28+00:00","funders":["niehs","wellcome"],"issns":["1550-6606","0022-1767"],"issue":"11","journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1416434962,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25348625","http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/193\/11\/5626.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"25348625","pubdate":"2014-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"5626","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Epitope Specificity Delimits the Functional Capabilities of Vaccine-Induced CD8 T Cell Populations","type":"article","volume":"193","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epitope-specificity-delimits-functional-capabilities-vaccineinduced-cd8-t-cell-populations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":4196797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2232527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199980,"mean":7.8486634996677,"rank":97950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":80592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199980,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7271,"mean":2.7047675378267,"rank":3845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7271,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":2.4978848167539,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
