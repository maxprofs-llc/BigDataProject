A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess risk factors for time to LFU.\nAmong 1593 patients, 458 (29%) were lost to follow-up. A total of 1240 MDR-TB patients were included in the final analysis (845 treatment success, 395 LFU). Over 40% of LFU occurred during the first 8 months of MDR-TB treatment; 40% of patients had not achieved culture conversion at the time of LFU. In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with LFU included male sex, illicit drug use, tobacco use, history of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment, site of TB disease, and place and year of initiating treatment.\nLFU was high among MDR-TB patients in Georgia and posed a significant public health risk, as many were culture-positive at the time of LFU. A multi-pronged approach is needed to address the various patient- and treatment-related characteristics associated with LFU.","authors":["G. Kuchukhidze","A. M. V. Kumar","P. de Colombani","M.
