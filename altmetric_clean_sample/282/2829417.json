Neurologic disorders are common in children with Down syndrome; however, in literature the presence of periodic movement disorders has not yet been described. We report 2 different types of periodic movement disorders in 2 infants with Down syndrome. In the first case, we described an 8-month-old girl with involuntary head nodding and absence of any other neurologic or ophthalmologic abnormalities. In the second case, we described a 6-month-old boy with abnormal but painless head rotation and inclination, alternating from side to side. Episodes of head tilting were often associated with a state of general uneasiness. Neurologic examination between attacks was normal. The aim of this paper is to provide practical information on recognition and management of movement disorders in Down syndrome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000c9e","authors":["Giulia Purpura","Margherita Bozza","Stefania Bargagna"],"doi":"10.1177\/0883073813508603","endpage":"NP130","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T01:53:23+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1708-8828","0883-0738"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Child Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1414513896,"links":["http:\/\/jcn.sagepub.com\/content\/29\/10\/NP127.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcn.sagepub.com\/content\/29\/10\/NP127.full.pdf","pmid":"24309245","pubdate":"2013-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"NP127","title":"Benign and Periodic Movement Disorders in 2 Children With Down Syndrome","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/benign-periodic-movement-disorders-2-children-down-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4439965,"mean":4.8062354731902,"rank":3437242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":130803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4439965,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123651,"mean":7.6268218196523,"rank":92680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123651,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1053,"mean":2.7249676806084,"rank":705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1053,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2.1747317073171,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
