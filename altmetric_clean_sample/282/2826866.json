The yeast extract (YE) resulted in a decrease of fermentation time by 21% to reach a pH of 4\u00b76. However, the YE resulted in unacceptable flavour and taste. By size exclusion chromatography, a fraction of the YE was obtained that could account for the observed 21% decrease in fermentation time. The fraction contained molecules of low molecular weight, consisting of minerals, free amino acids and peptides. The acceleration of the yoghurt fermentation was ascribed to the short peptides in the fraction. It is proposed that the application of this extract in industrial yoghurt manufacture would result in savings for both the industry and the consumer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c31","authors":["Esti-Andrine Smith","Jacobus Myburgh","Gernot Osthoff","Maryna de Wit"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0022029914000429","first_seen_on":"2014-10-30T15:48:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-7629"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Dairy Research","last_mentioned_on":1414684024,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25353311?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25353311","pubdate":"2014-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Acceleration of yoghurt fermentation time by yeast extract and partial characterisation of the active components.","type":"article","volume":"81","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acceleration-yoghurt-fermentation-time-yeast-extract-partial-characterisation-active-components"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4448839,"mean":4.7981200125192,"rank":3440258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":130939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4448839,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122943,"mean":7.5680872606596,"rank":91939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":813,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122943,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.7446804123711,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.3125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":7,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/status\/527849172754366464","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2826866],"posted_on":"2014-10-30T15:47:04+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
