TREM-1 and TREM-2, the best-characterized receptors so far, play divergent roles in several infectious diseases. In the intestine, TREM-1 is highly expressed by macrophages, contributing to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis. Contrary to current understanding, TREM-2 also promotes inflammation in IBD by fueling dendritic cell functions. This review will focus specifically on recent insights into the role of TREM proteins in IBD development, and discuss opportunities for novel treatment approaches.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","doi":"10.1186\/s12967-014-0293-z","first_seen_on":"2014-10-30T05:36:44+00:00","issns":["1479-5876"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1414663395,"links":["http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/12\/1\/293\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25347935?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/pdf\/s12967-014-0293-z.pdf","pmid":"25347935","pubdate":"2014-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"293","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/triggering-receptor-expressed-myeloid-cells-trem-inflammatory-bowel-disease-pathogenesis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1778739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2653378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123931,"mean":8.478892374728,"rank":43974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":77591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123931,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1265,"mean":2.8081803797468,"rank":323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1265,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.7680425531915,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
