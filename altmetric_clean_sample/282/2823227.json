An increase in heart rate equal to or greater than 30 bpm or to levels higher than 120 bpm during a head-up tilt test is the main diagnostic criterion. Management includes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment focusing on stress management, volume expansion and heart rate control.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd48","authors":["Louise Brinth","Kirsten Pors","Jesper Mehlsen"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-30T02:39:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1603-6824"],"issue":"11B","journal":"Ugeskrift for laeger","last_mentioned_on":1414636691,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25350809?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25350809","pubdate":"2014-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.]","type":"article","volume":"176","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-11"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3056241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":931218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123932,"mean":8.4002252705136,"rank":81785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":30177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123932,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293,"mean":1.6885684931507,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.003,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
