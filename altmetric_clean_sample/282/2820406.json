It is characterized by sparse to complete absence of hair on the scalp and other parts of the body. In few cases tightly curled twisted wooly hair on the scalp has been reported as well. The hair loss disorders, including both syndromic and non-syndromic (isolated) forms, segregate either in autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive pattern. To date, seven autosomal dominant and equal numbers of autosomal recessive isolated forms of hair loss disorders have been characterized. Genes responsible for causing most of these disorders have been identified. In this review we have provided an update on clinical and genetic aspects of isolated hereditary hair loss disorders manifesting with hypotrichosis and\/or wooly hairs. Since most of the recessive genes have been mapped using consanguineous families of Pakistani origin therefore emphasis is given to mutations identified in these families. OMIM nomenclature has been followed to indicate different forms of hair loss disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002559","authors":["Sulman Basit","Saadullah Khan","Wasim Ahmad"],"doi":"10.1111\/cge.12531","first_seen_on":"2014-10-29T17:36:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1399-0004"],"journal":"Clinical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1414604132,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25350920"],"pmid":"25350920","pubdate":"2014-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Genetics of Human Isolated Hereditary Hair Loss Disorders.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetics-human-isolated-hereditary-hair-loss-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4444531,"mean":4.8009402132277,"rank":3438761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":130963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4444531,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123790,"mean":7.5974994224043,"rank":92601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123790,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":934,"mean":2.3234147909968,"rank":775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":934,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.4193333333333,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Genetics of Human Isolated Hereditary Hair Loss Disorders. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1255299473\/posts\/10204930371719781","license":"public","citation_ids":[2820406],"posted_on":"2014-10-29T17:35:32+00:00","summary":"Bas mong nor research na resign kawo che Saadullah Khan hum reviewers sho... \n\nCongratulations dears\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25350920 www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","author":{"name":"Musharraf Jelani","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1255299473","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1255299473\/picture","id_on_source":"1255299473"}}]}}
