These compounds crystallize in the Ca9Mn4Bi9 structure type (9-4-9) with the 4g interstitial site almost half-occupied by coinage metals; these are the first members in the 9-4-9 family where the interstitial positions are occupied by a monovalent metal. All previously known compounds with this structure type include divalent interstitials where these interstitials are typically the same as the transition metals in the anionic framework. Single-crystal magnetic susceptibility data indicate paramagnetic behavior for all three compounds with antiferromagnetic ordering below 10 K (at 100 Oe) that shifts to lower temperature (<7 K) by applying a 3 T magnetic field. (151)Eu M\u00f6ssbauer spectra were collected on polycrystalline powder samples of Eu9Cd4-xCM2+x-y\u25a1ySb9 at 50 and 6.5 K in order to evaluate the valence of Eu cations. Although the Zintl formalism states that the five crystallographically distinct Eu sites in Eu9Cd4-xCM2+x-y\u25a1ySb9 should bear Eu(2+), the M\u00f6ssbauer spectral isomer shifts are clearly indicative of both 2+ and 3+ valence of the Eu cations with the Cu- and Au-containing compounds showing higher amounts of Eu(3+). This electronic configuration leads to an excess of negative charge in these compounds that contradicts the expected valence-precise requirement of Zintl phases. The spectra obtained at 6.5 K reveal magnetic ordering for both Eu(2+) and Eu(3+). The field dependence of Eu(2+) indicates two distinct magnetic sublattices, with higher and lower fields, and of a small field for Eu(3+). The site symmetry of the five Eu sites is not distinguishable from the M\u00f6ssbauer data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Nasrin Kazem","Antonio Hurtado","Benedikt Klobes","Rapha\u00ebl P.
