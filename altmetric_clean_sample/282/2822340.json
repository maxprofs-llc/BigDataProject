However, little is known regarding the effect of puerarin, a phytoestrogen extracted from Radix Puerariae, on arterial calcification. The aim of the present study was to determine whether puerarin reduced osteoblastic differentiation of calcifying vascular smooth muscle cells (CVSMCs). The CVSMCs were isolated from mice aorta and treated with different concentrations of puerarin. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin secretion and Runx2 expression were determined. To examine whether estrogen receptors (ERs) PI3K and Akt play a role in this effect, ICI182789, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, or the Akt inhibitor, 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate (HIMO) was used. Our results showed puerarin could inhibit ALP activity, osteocalcin secretion and Runx2 expression in CVSMCs. Puerarin could induce the activation of Akt. Furthermore, pretreatment of ICI182780, LY294002, HIMO could abolish the effect of puerarin on ALP activity in CVSMCs. Our experiment demonstrated that puerain could attenuate the osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs through the ER\/PI3K-Akt signal pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f2","authors":["Lu Q","Xiang DX","Yuan HY","Xiao Y","Yuan LQ","Li HB"],"doi":"10.1142\/s0192415x14500220","first_seen_on":"2014-10-30T00:20:55+00:00","issns":["0192-415X"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Chinese Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1414579776,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24707866?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24707866","pubdate":"2014-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Puerarin attenuates calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/puerarin-attenuates-calcification-vascular-smooth-muscle-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4444531,"mean":4.8009402132277,"rank":3438671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":130966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4444531,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122877,"mean":7.5779321266969,"rank":91998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122877,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":4.2742848664688,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.0045454545455,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
