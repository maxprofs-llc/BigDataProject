When confronted with adversity, the process of development is delayed in plants. This phenomenon is thought to result from the rebalancing of energy, which helps plants coordinate the relationship between development and stress tolerance. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains mysterious. In this study, we found that miR156 integrates environmental signals to ensure timely flowering, thus enabling the completion of breeding. Under stress conditions, miR156 is induced to maintain the plant in the juvenile state for a relatively long period of time, while under good conditions, miR156 is suppressed to accelerate the developmental transition. Blocking the miR156 signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana with 35S::MIM156 (via target mimicry) increased the plant's sensitivity to stress treatment, while overexpression of miR156 increased stress tolerance. In fact, this mechanism is also conserved in rice. We also identified downstream genes of miR156, i.e., SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE9 (SPL9) and DIHYDROFLAVONOL-4-REDUCTASE (DFR), which take part in this process by influencing the metabolism of anthocyanin. Our results uncover a molecular mechanism for plant adaptation to the environment through the miR156-SPLs-DFR pathway, which coordinates development and abiotic stress tolerance.
