The disease is caused by infiltration of allo-activated donor T cells primarily into the gastrointestinal tract and skin. While cytotoxic T cells mediate direct cellular damage, T helper (Th) cells differentially secrete immunoregulatory cytokines. Acute GvHD is thought to be primarily initiated by Th1 cells but a consensus is still lacking regarding the role of Th2 and Th17 cells. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of distinct T cell subsets to aGvHD in the rat. Acute GvHD was induced by transplanting irradiated rats with T-cell depleted MHC-mismatched bone marrow, followed two weeks later by donor lymphocyte infusion. Near complete donor T cell chimerism was achieved in the blood and lymphatic tissues, in contrast to mixed chimerism in the skin and gut. Skin and gut donor T cells were predominantly CD4(+), in contrast to T cells in blood and lymphatic tissues. Genes associated with Th1 cells were up-regulated in gut, liver, lung, and skin tissues affected by aGvHD. Increased serum levels of CXCL10 and IL-18 preceded symptoms of aGvHD, accompanied by increased responsiveness to CXCL10 by blood CD4(+) T cells. No changes in expression of Th2- or Th17-associated genes were observed, indicating that aGvHD in this rat model is mainly Th1-driven. The rat model of aGvHD could be instrumental for further investigations of donor T cell subsets in the skin and gut, and for exploring therapeutic options to ameliorate symptoms of aGvHD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002895","authors":["Margherita Boieri","Pranali Shah","Dasaradha Jalapothu","Olena Zaitseva","Lutz Walter","Bent Rolstad","Christian Naper","Ralf Dressel","Marit Inngjerdingen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.exphem.2017.02.002","first_seen_on":"2017-03-07T13:52:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0301472X","0301-472X"],"journal":"Experimental Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1488894715,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=1&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.exphem.org%2Farticle%2FS0301-472X%2817%2930061-9%2Ffulltext&code=exphem-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.exphem.org\/article\/S0301472X17300619\/pdf","pmid":"28238806","pubdate":"2017-02-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Rat acute GvHD is Th1-driven and characterized by predominant donor CD4+ T cell infiltration of skin and gut","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0301472X17300619","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rat-acute-gvhd-th1-driven-characterized-predominant-donor-cd4-tcell-infiltration-skin-gut"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":4431727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2315879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241940,"mean":13.680704648692,"rank":138754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":80473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241940,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":489,"mean":2.756987704918,"rank":248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":489,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.0941176470588,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ISEHSociety\/statuses\/839111370733993984","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17080946],"posted_on":"2017-03-07T13:51:55+00:00","author":{"name":"ISEH","url":"http:\/\/www.iseh.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/484735777243267072\/SO6GJdMv_normal.jpeg","description":"ISEH promotes the scientific knowledge & clinical application of basic hematology, immunology, stem cell research, cell and gene therapy.","id_on_source":"ISEHSociety","tweeter_id":"995340066","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":281},"tweet_id":"839111370733993984"}]}}
