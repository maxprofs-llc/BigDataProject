A series of compounds of the general composition Ph3P-C-L with L being either a neutral or an anionic ligand were analysed and the impact of the nature of the substituent L and the total charge on the electronics and bonding situation were studied. The charge at the carbon atom as well as the dissociation energies, bond lengths and bond indices strongly depend on the nature of L. Here, not only the charge of the ligand but also the position of the charge within the ligand backbone plays an important role. Independent of the substitution pattern, the NBO analysis reveals the preference of unsymmetrical bonding situations (P=C-L or P-C=L) for almost all compounds. However, Lewis structures with two lone-pair orbitals at the central carbon atom are equally valid for the description of the bonding situation. This is confirmed by the pronounced lone-pair character of the frontier orbitals. Energy decomposition analysis mostly reveals the preference of several bonding situations, mostly with dative and ylidic electron-sharing bonds (e.g. P\u2192C--L+). In general, the anionic systems show a higher preference of the ylidic bonding situations compared to the neutral analogues. However, in most of the cases different resonance structures have to be considered for the description of the \"real\" bonding situation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Scharf, Lennart T.","Andrada, Diego M.","Frenking, Gernot","Gessner, Viktoria H."],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201605997","first_seen_on":"2017-03-07T15:38:30+00:00","issns":["09476539","1521-3765"],"journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1488901076,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605997\/abstract;jsessionid=BDD5D2BDB5FDF213D271FA57838D53FA.f04t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605997\/pdf","pmid":"28121371","pubdate":"2017-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"The Bonding Situation in Metalated Ylides","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/chem.201605997","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bonding-situation-metalated-ylides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":7193851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241940,"mean":13.680694108845,"rank":201228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241940,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6206,"mean":3.1196219178082,"rank":4479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6206,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":448,"mean":2.3220805369128,"rank":304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":448,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":7}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1},"mendeley":{"JP":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemEurJ\/statuses\/839138052140331008","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17083183],"posted_on":"2017-03-07T15:37:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Chemistry","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1002\/(ISSN)1521-3765","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/669149218846720000\/C7lWCugX_normal.jpg","description":"Chemistry - A European Journal\r\nMultidisciplinary Chemistry Journal from ChemPubSoc Europe","id_on_source":"ChemEurJ","tweeter_id":"1522831152","geo":{"lt":49.54887,"ln":8.66697,"country":"DE"},"followers":3520},"tweet_id":"839138052140331008"}]}}
