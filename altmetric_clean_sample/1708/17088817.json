View counts, traffic sources, and geographic origins of the traffic for each language version were tracked over a twenty-two-month period.\nTotal view counts for all 4 language versions amounted to 3,357 views, with the Chinese version accounting for 71% of the total views. The trends in view counts over time for the Japanese, Russian, and English versions were similar, with high interest at the beginning and a rapid drop and low level of viewing activity thereafter. The pattern of view counts for the Chinese version departed considerably from the other language versions, with very low activity at the beginning but a sharp rise 10 months later. This increase in activity was related to access to the presentations via a Taiwanese website that embedded the SlideShare website code.\nLanguage translation can be a difficult and time-consuming task. However, translation of a conference slide presentation with limited text is an achievable activity and engages an international audience for information that is often not noticed or lost. Although English is by far the primary language of science and other disciplines, it is not necessarily the first or preferred language of global researchers. By offering appropriate language versions, the authors of presentations can expand the reach of their work.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f6d","authors":["Lilian Hoffecker","Dana Abbey"],"doi":"10.5195\/jmla.2017.106","first_seen_on":"2017-03-07T20:25:33+00:00","issns":["1558-9439","1536-5050"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of the Medical Library Association","last_mentioned_on":1488918318,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5234450\/"],"pmid":"28096746","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medical Library Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"49","subjects":["libraryscience"],"title":"From English to Chinese, Japanese, and Russian: extending research visibility with language translations of a conference slide presentation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/jmla.pitt.edu\/ojs\/jmla\/article\/view\/106","volume":"105","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/english-chinese-japanese-russian-extending-research-visibility-language-translations-conference-slid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":4431727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2315897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241940,"mean":13.680653809431,"rank":138757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":80481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241940,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":506,"mean":6.1109782178218,"rank":350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":506,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.26375,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Arts and Humanities":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JrnlMedLibAssn\/statuses\/839210370053128198","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17088817],"posted_on":"2017-03-07T20:25:18+00:00","author":{"name":"JMLA","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/journals\/93\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/430765274413801472\/h9jJCz62_normal.jpeg","description":"JMLA is the peer-reviewed, quarterly journal of the Medical Library Association.","id_on_source":"JrnlMedLibAssn","tweeter_id":"2280768120","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":94},"tweet_id":"839210370053128198"}]}}
