Its timely diagnosis is essential because it can result in neurologic deficits or death. We report a case of a 58-year-old man who died from cerebral air embolism diagnosed by nonenhanced computed tomography scan of the head after a cardiac bypass surgery with Biventricular Assist Device and multiple vascular line placements. Autopsy revealed extensive subcutaneous emphysema, intravascular and perivascular air bubbles in the central nervous system and associated cerebral and cerebellar hemorrhagic infarction. The autopsy was helpful in documenting the extent of the air embolism and its appearance in soft tissue and central nervous system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006975","authors":["Roquero, Leonardo Pacheco","Camelo-Piragua, Sandra","Schmidt, Carl"],"doi":"10.1097\/paf.0000000000000276","first_seen_on":"2016-10-23T17:14:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-404X","0195-7910"],"journal":"The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1477242845,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/amjforensicmedicine\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Cerebral_Air_Embolism__A_Clinical,_Radiologic_and.99352.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjforensicmedicine\/9000\/00000\/Cerebral_Air_Embolism__A_Clinical,_Radiologic_and.99352.pdf","pmid":"27763884","pubdate":"2016-10-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pathology","jurisprudence"],"title":"Cerebral Air Embolism","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/amjforensicmedicine\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Cerebral_Air_Embolism__A_Clinical,_Radiologic_and.99352.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cerebral-air-embolismclinicradiolhistopath-correlation-2016"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7584550,"mean":6.538792679956,"rank":5739677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1017557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7584550,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235909,"mean":12.609383844549,"rank":163805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235909,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":597,"mean":3.2257013422819,"rank":434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":597,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":7.4555555555556,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/amjforensicmed\/statuses\/790239886074720256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12921780],"posted_on":"2016-10-23T17:14:05+00:00","author":{"name":"AMJ ForensicMedicine","url":"http:\/\/www.amjforensicmedicine.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1464487726\/ajfmp_normal.jpg","description":"The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology presents up-to-date coverage of forensic medical practices worldwide.","id_on_source":"amjforensicmed","tweeter_id":"334230697","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":316},"tweet_id":"790239886074720256"}]}}
