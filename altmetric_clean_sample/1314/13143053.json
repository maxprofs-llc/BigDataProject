Survivors completed surveys pre- and post-cancer diagnosis on 13 chronic conditions and functional status. Among those with \u22652 conditions, exploratory factor analysis identified clusters of conditions. Differences in cluster frequency from pre- to post-cancer diagnosis were evaluated across the top five cancer types using chi-square tests. Modified Poisson regression models estimated the relative risk of developing clusters post-diagnosis. Chi-square tests evaluated associations between function and clusters.\nClusters included the following: cardiovascular disease cluster (pre 6.1\u00a0% and post 7.7\u00a0%), musculoskeletal cluster (28.2\u00a0% and 29.3\u00a0%), metabolic cluster (14.9\u00a0% and 17.6\u00a0%), and the major depressive disorder risk (MDDr)\u2009+\u2009gastrointestinal (GI)\u2009+\u2009pulmonary condition cluster (5.8\u00a0% and 8.7\u00a0%). Increases in MDDr\u2009+\u2009GI\u2009+\u2009Pulmonary cluster from pre- to post-cancer diagnosis were observed for prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer survivors. Functional impairment was more prevalent in survivors with defined clusters, especially in MDDr\u2009+\u2009GI\u2009+\u2009pulmonary, compared to survivors with \u22652 un-clustered conditions.\nDistinct condition clusters of two or more chronic conditions are prevalent among older cancer survivors. Cluster prevalence increases from pre- to post-cancer diagnosis and these clusters have a significant impact on functional limitations.\nTailored management on specific multimorbidity patterns will have implications for functional outcomes among older survivors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb1","authors":["Kenzik, Kelly M","Kent, Erin E","Martin, Michelle Y","Bhatia, Smita","Pisu, Maria"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11764-016-0553-4","first_seen_on":"2016-10-29T23:52:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-2267","1932-2259"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Cancer Survivorship","last_mentioned_on":1477902844,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27229869"],"pmid":"27229869","pubdate":"2016-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Primary Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quality of Life Research","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Chronic condition clusters and functional impairment in older cancer survivors: a population-based study","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-condition-clusters-functional-impairment-older-cancer-survivors-populationbased-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.55,"score_history":{"1y":3.55,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7625034,"mean":6.5623772256419,"rank":1703097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5912591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7625034,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235076,"mean":12.718675299372,"rank":74622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":159969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235076,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":362,"mean":7.8042271468144,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":362,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.195,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NicoleStoutPT\/statuses\/792514312749387777","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13143053],"posted_on":"2016-10-29T23:51:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Nicole L.
