In the Shanghai International Settlement, where Chinese and foreigners lived as neighbours, drugs were considered by the administration as both \"trouble maker\", and important financial resource. This paper explores how the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), the most senior governing body in the settlement, used its position to maximize political and economic profit from the trade and consumption of opium.\nThe paper is based on documentary analysis of records of the SMC board meetings and other related material stored at Shanghai Municipal Archives. Interpretive approaches were used to analyze the shifting SMC strategies on opium consumption, the competing power relations and the way they were negotiated between actors with a stake in the region, including semi-colonialism and world systems analysis.\nWith the dual purpose of preventing damage and enhancing municipal management, the SMC introduced a licensing system permitting the consumption and trade of drugs. However, the anti-opium policies of the late Qing government and the Anglo-Chinese 10 Year Agreement meant SMC had to shut down opium \"houses\" (opium dens) and \"shops\" (for the sale of opium to be consumed off the premises).\nOver almost a decade, the SMC shifted emphasis from political regulation of a social, recreational practice to maximizing financial benefit. In the process, SMC made full use of the opportunities it gained from a period of ambivalent Chinese and British power relations and local community rule.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b41","authors":["Zhang, Yong-An","Du, Yilun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.drugpo.2016.09.006","first_seen_on":"2016-10-30T01:25:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4758","09553959"],"journal":"International Journal of Drug Policy","last_mentioned_on":1479475224,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27780655"],"pmid":"27780655","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Lessons in ambivalence: The Shanghai Municipal Council\u2019s opium policies, 1906\u20131917","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711682,"mean":6.6148164461077,"rank":3339568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4285367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711682,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235959,"mean":12.769299248171,"rank":102288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":130100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235959,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1058,"mean":9.6322762535478,"rank":802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1058,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":11.148648648649,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Why_We_Do_That\/statuses\/792537791666192385","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13144412],"posted_on":"2016-10-30T01:25:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Why_We_Do_That","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/779459146\/Rorschach_4_normal.jpg","description":"Psychology; how, why & what not.
