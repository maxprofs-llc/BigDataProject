Complex genetic factors are likely to play a role in CH etiology; however, no confirmed gene associations have been identified. The aim of this study is to identify genetic variants influencing risk to CH and to explore the potential pathogenic mechanisms.\nWe have performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a clinically well-defined cohort of 99 Italian patients with CH and in a control sample of 360 age-matched sigarette smoking healthy individuals, using the Infinium PsychArray (Illumina), which combines common highly-informative genome-wide tag SNPs and exonic SNPs. Genotype data were used to carry out a genome-wide single marker case-control association analysis using common SNPs, and a gene-based association analysis focussing on rare protein altering variants in 745 candidate genes with a putative role in CH.\nAlthough no single variant showed statistically significant association at the genome-wide threshold, we identified an interesting suggestive association (P\u2009=\u20099.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-6)) with a common variant of the PACAP receptor gene (ADCYAP1R1). Furthermore, gene-based analysis provided significant evidence of association (P\u2009=\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-5)) for a rare potentially damaging missense variant in the MME gene, encoding for the membrane metallo-endopeptidase neprilysin.\nOur study represents the first genome-wide association study of common SNPs and rare exonic variants influencing risk for CH. The most interesting results implicate ADCYAP1R1 and MME gene variants in CH susceptibility and point to a role for genes involved in pain processing. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of CH that need further investigation and replication in larger CH samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dcd","authors":["Elena Bacchelli","Maria Michela Cainazzo","Cinzia Cameli","Simona Guerzoni","Angela Martinelli","Michele Zoli","Elena Maestrini","Luigi Alberto Pini","Bacchelli, Elena","Cainazzo, Maria Michela","Cameli, Cinzia","Guerzoni, Simona","Martinelli, Angela","Zoli, Michele","Maestrini, Elena","Pini, Luigi Alberto"],"doi":"10.1186\/s10194-016-0705-y","first_seen_on":"2016-12-13T15:32:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1129-2377","1129-2369"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Headache & Pain","last_mentioned_on":1481838925,"links":["http:\/\/thejournalofheadacheandpain.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s10194-016-0705-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/thejournalofheadacheandpain.springeropen.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s10194-016-0705-y?site=thejournalofheadacheandpain.springeropen.com","pmcid":"PMC5153392","pmid":"27957625","pubdate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Milan","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology","internalmedicine"],"title":"A genome-wide analysis in cluster headache points to neprilysin and PACAP receptor gene variants","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/thejournalofheadacheandpain.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s10194-016-0705-y","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-analysis-cluster-headache-points-neprilysin-pacap-receptor-gene-variants-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7890722,"mean":6.6811441707233,"rank":3558780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4253561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7890722,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251721,"mean":12.355473208326,"rank":113895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":134266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251721,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":558,"mean":5.1540251346499,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":558,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":6.9846,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
