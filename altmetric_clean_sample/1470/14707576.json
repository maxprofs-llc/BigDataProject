As a consequence, little is known about strain differences in the establishment of longer lasting memories of aversive events. In the present study, male mice from the strains A\/Ibg, AKR\/J, BALB\/cByJ, CBA\/J, C3H\/HeIbg, C57BL\/6J, DBA\/2J, LP\/J, SJL\/J and 129\/SvevTac were tested 24 h, 14, or 60 days after contextual and auditory-cued fear conditioning. Consistent with previous data, 24 h after conditioning these strains exhibited substantial variation in levels of memory for the context and the auditory cue as measured by freezing scores. Sixty days after training, most strains exhibited some forgetting of the context and auditory cue, and again there was significant strain variation. Strain rankings at 60-day retention were similar to that at 24 h with a significant genetic correlation between freezing values for the two time periods. Fourteen days following training, nearly all strains exhibited generalized freezing, a behavioral phenotype originally observed in C57BL\/6 but not DBA\/2 mice. These data confirm that cognitive differences exist between several popular inbred mouse strains during 24 h contextual fear recall. In addition, they extend these differences into retention time frames longer than those typically used and reveal several unique learning profiles of mouse strains that may be useful in furthering our understanding of how memories are formed. Emotionally arousing situations are often recalled a great deal of time after an event. Therefore, a more complete picture of the biochemical and genetic underpinnings of learning and memory will benefit from studies using time points that assess time points beyond 24 h retention. The utility of the 14-day hyper responsiveness phenotype as a potential model for fear-related psychopathology is also discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ad","authors":["Balogh, Seth A","Wehner, Jeanne M","Seth A Balogh","Jeanne M Wehner"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0166-4328(02)00279-6","endpage":"106","first_seen_on":"2016-12-13T17:54:18+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0166-4328","01664328"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Behavioural Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1199145600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0166-4328(02)00279-6"],"pmid":"12644283","pubdate":"2003-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"97","subjects":["brain","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Inbred mouse strain differences in the establishment of long-term fear memory","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0166432802002796","volume":"140","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inbred-mouse-strain-differences-establishment-longterm-fear-memory-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7236225,"mean":6.3639508378921,"rank":1721051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4599461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7236225,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215241,"mean":12.505339304962,"rank":72274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":139872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215241,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2220,"mean":4.4966669671023,"rank":545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2220,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":2.1844444444444,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
