This amoeba is a ubiquitous organism that has been isolated from various domestic water systems, such as cooling towers and hospital water networks. The objective of this work was to investigate the presence of Acanthamoeba in mineral water bottles marketed in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. Positive samples were further classified at the genotype level after sequencing the ASA.S1 region of 18S rDNA gene. Six of the eight isolates belonged to T5 genotype, one to T4 genotype, and one was T11. Several genotypes have been reported worldwide as causative of pathologies in humans, including genotypes T4, T5 and T11. Overall, the widespread distribution of potentially pathogenic Acanthamoeba strains in the studied source demands more awareness within the public and health professionals, because this pathogen is emerging as a risk for human health worldwide.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000269a","authors":["Maschio VJ","Chies F","Carlesso AM","Carvalho A","Rosa SP","Van Der Sand ST","Rott MB"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00284-014-0676-7","first_seen_on":"2014-08-19T05:53:17+00:00","issns":["0343-8651"],"issue":"","journal":"Current Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1408099056,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25119309?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25119309","pubdate":"2014-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Acanthamoeba T4, T5 and T11 Isolated From Mineral Water Bottles in Southern Brazil.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acanthamoeba-t4-t5-t11-isolated-mineral-water-bottles-southern-brazil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2163392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2869095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129903,"mean":8.3619805853646,"rank":49284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":80518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129903,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":462,"mean":2.5960911062907,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":462,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.87333333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
