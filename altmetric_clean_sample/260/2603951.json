SCDs are recognized targets for DNA-damage-response (DDR) kinases like ATM and ATR. Characterizing DDR targets is of significant interest. The aim of this work was to develop a web-based tool to allow for easy identification and visualization of SCDs within specific proteins or in whole proteome sets, a feature not supported by current domain and motif search tools.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Lukas Cara","Medina Baitemirova","Franklin Duong","Maia Larios-Sanz","Albert Ribes-Zamora"],"doi":"10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btu551","first_seen_on":"2014-08-19T07:17:59+00:00","issns":["1460-2059"],"journal":"Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1417717545,"links":["http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/08\/13\/bioinformatics.btu551.short?rss=1","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/30\/23\/3394.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/08\/13\/bioinformatics.btu551.full.pdf","pmid":"25123905","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"SCDFinder, a Web-based tool for the identification of putative novel ATM and ATR targets","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/scdfinder-webbased-tool-identification-putative-novel-atm-atr-targets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4584253,"mean":5.3814380987108,"rank":2047485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2426648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4584253,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114235,"mean":8.2680909011328,"rank":46536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":63850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114235,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4357,"mean":5.7081409550046,"rank":2944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4357,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":14.303573770492,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
