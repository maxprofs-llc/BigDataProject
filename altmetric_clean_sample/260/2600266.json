Evidence suggests that our preparation is indeed different from that of other methods. Our new data suggest that, apart from hairpin-dependent termination, one or more \"fail-safe\" termination mechanisms may exist in the cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Nielsen S","Zenkin N"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1254246","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T21:06:52+00:00","funders":["bbsrc"],"issns":["0036-8075"],"issue":"6196","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1408156517,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25082695?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25082695","pubdate":"2014-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Transcription.
