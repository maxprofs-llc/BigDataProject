Since inorganic Hg is the predominant form excreted in the feces and urine, hepatic biotransformation is a critical step in its normal clearance. This study was set to test the hypothesis that compromised liver function is associated with body burden of Hg as indirectly reflected by Hg sampled in blood and urine. From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2003-2008), 3769 adults aged 20 years and above were selected for analysis. Hepatic function was inferred from the three standard serum liver-related enzyme activities, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Multivariate regression models were used to examine the associations of interest. Although urinary Hg was significantly correlated with serum Hg, the blood-urinary Hg relationship was influenced by liver function, which is also a function of demographic and lifestyle factors (e.g., gender). Although the results were only marginally significant for examined enzymes (p=0.06-0.08), urinary Hg tended to be lower among subjects with elevated liver enzymes, as compared to those with normal enzyme measurements. Conversely, MeHg generally represents a higher fraction of the total circulating Hg among those with elevated liver enzyme levels, especially among participants with elevations in all three enzymes (p=0.01). In conclusion, this population-based study identified an association between liver function, serum Hg and urinary Hg. Urinalysis may not be the optimal approach to monitor Hg elimination toxicokinetics or Hg exposure, since the majority of Hg excretion is fecal and the fidelity of urinary excretion may depend on healthy liver function. Future prospective studies are warranted to expand these findings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e3","doi":"10.1016\/j.envint.2014.05.010","first_seen_on":"2014-08-19T18:17:44+00:00","issns":["01604120"],"journal":"Environment International","last_mentioned_on":1407946514,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0160412014001536"],"pmid":"24908642","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Association of body burden of mercury with liver function test status in the U.S. population ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-body-burden-mercury-liver-function-test-status-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2295508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1618488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113498,"mean":7.9693951558193,"rank":55172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":44159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113498,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":624,"mean":7.8832359550562,"rank":366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":624,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":16.263222222222,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/eiNetMN\/status\/499588953595334657","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2609422],"posted_on":"2014-08-13T16:11:03+00:00","author":{"name":"ei Network Minnesota","url":"http:\/\/mnenvironmentalillnessnetwork.tumblr.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1787687716\/bird_on_two_colors_normal.jpeg","description":"Environmental Illness Network Minnesota is a community for environmentally sensitive Minnesotans and those who care about them.
