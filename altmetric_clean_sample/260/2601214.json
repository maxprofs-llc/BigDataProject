While the role for melatonin in cyclic behavior via interactions with the circadian clock has only been reported in vertebrates, comparative research has shown that the transcription-translation loops of the animal circadian clock likely date to the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor, leaving open significant questions about the evolutionary origin of melatonin signaling in circadian behavior by interacting with the molecular clock.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000818","doi":"10.1186\/2041-9139-5-26","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T22:57:48+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["2041-9139"],"issue":"1","journal":"EvoDevo","last_mentioned_on":1411979353,"links":["http:\/\/www.evodevojournal.com\/content\/5\/1\/26\/abstract","http:\/\/www.evodevojournal.com\/content\/5\/1\/26"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.evodevojournal.com\/content\/pdf\/2041-9139-5-26.pdf","pmid":"25243057","pubdate":"2014-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"26","title":"Developmental and light-entrained expression of melatonin and its relationship to the circadian clock in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developmental-lightentrained-expression-melatonin-relationship-circadian-clock-sea-anemone-nematoste"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":2876522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1468426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112990,"mean":8.0586631264993,"rank":69292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":39273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112990,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":6.6953768115942,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":14.954285714286,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
