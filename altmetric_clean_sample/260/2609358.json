The protein can function as a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), an ion channel, or as an enzyme. This logic can be mimicked with synthetic photoswitches, such as azobenzenes, that are linked to naturally 'blind' transmembrane proteins using in vivo-chemistry. The resulting semisynthetic receptors can be employed to optically control cellular functions, especially in neurons, and influence the behavior of animals with the exquisite temporal and spatial precision of light.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a1","doi":"10.1016\/j.cbpa.2014.07.008","first_seen_on":"2014-08-19T18:10:16+00:00","issns":["13675931"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1408954286,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1367593114000921","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cbpa.2014.07.008"],"pmid":"25108802","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"The in vivo chemistry of photoswitched tethered ligands.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vivo-chemistry-photoswitched-tethered-ligands"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2897476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1454104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113498,"mean":7.9700427500288,"rank":69464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":39935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113498,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":596,"mean":2.0850588235294,"rank":274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":596,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.0788461538462,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
