Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC22A4 gene have been previously reported to be associated with RA in Japanese but not European populations. This study further investigated the association of SLC22A4 polymorphisms, in particular slc2F1\/slc2F2, with RA in the Chinese population, the largest Asian population. A total of 160 human subjects with 95 RA patients and 65 healthy controls were genotyped for slc2F1-G\/A and slc2F2-C\/T polymorphisms. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the genotype distribution of these two polymorphisms between the two groups. In addition, the presence of slc2F1 A allele and slc2F2 T allele carries a 1.93-fold and 2.14-fold increased risk for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) positivity, respectively. Overall, this study provided evidence that SLC22A4 gene polymorphisms played important roles in the etiology of RA in the largest Asian population, the Chinese population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000662e","authors":["Ren, Tian\u2010li","Han, Zhi\u2010jun","Yang, Cheng\u2010jian","Hang, Yuan\u2010xing","Fang, De\u2010yu","Wang, Ke","Zhu, Xue","Ji, Xiao\u2010jing","Zhou, Fan\u2010fan"],"doi":"10.1002\/jbt.21554","endpage":"210","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T20:56:58+00:00","issns":["1099-0461","1095-6670"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Biochemical & Molecular Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1408160099,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbt.21554\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbt.21554\/pdf","pmid":"24599653","pubdate":"2014-03-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"206","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Association of SLC22A4 Gene Polymorphism with Rheumatoid Arthritis in the Chinese Population","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-slc22a4-gene-polymorphism-rheumatoid-arthritis-chinese-population"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6262813,"mean":5.9881189468902,"rank":5324527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6262813,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142825,"mean":8.2537831456899,"rank":113845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142825,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":1.9998082191781,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Association of SLC22A4 Gene Polymorphism with Rheumatoid Arthritis in the Chinese Population -...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100001751770839\/posts\/524155971061210","license":"public","citation_ids":[2600200],"posted_on":"2014-08-16T03:34:59+00:00","summary":"Please,I need this paper \nhttp:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbt.21554\/full","author":{"name":"Aya Alshahawy","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100001751770839","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/100001751770839\/picture","id_on_source":"100001751770839"}}]}}
