Unfortunately, none of the current ambitious collaborative neuroscience projects pay enough attention to this topic and are thus unable to completely relate the microlevel properties of the system to its emergent macrolevel behaviors. In this review article, the problem of effective connectivity at the synaptic level in humans is explained, existing and possible computational approaches to fill explanatory gaps are reviewed, and the requisite characteristics of these approaches are considered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d7","authors":["\u00d6nder G\u00fcrcan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00422-014-0619-1","first_seen_on":"2014-08-19T10:51:21+00:00","issns":["1432-0770","0340-1200"],"journal":"Biological Cybernetics","last_mentioned_on":1408445460,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00422-014-0619-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00422-014-0619-1.pdf","pmid":"25128317","pubdate":"2014-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Appl. in Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Statistical Physics, Dynamical Systems and Complexity","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"subjects":["physiology","neurology"],"title":"Effective connectivity at synaptic level in humans: a review and future prospects","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effective-connectivity-synaptic-level-humans-review-future-prospects-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4156414,"mean":5.106379868597,"rank":2335659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1064911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4156414,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106638,"mean":8.0910523926967,"rank":58178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":27969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106638,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":3.0699685863874,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":5.83,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
