For these investigational aortic catheter-based therapies to reach their greatest potential clinical benefit, the ability to initiate them in the prehospital setting will be important. Feasibility of prehospital aortic catheterization without imaging capability supports this potential and is described in this report.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb22a83ee005f8b4573","doi":"10.1097\/ta.0b013e318299d9ee","first_seen_on":"2014-08-19T07:20:54+00:00","issns":["2163-0755"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, The","last_mentioned_on":1421889775,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/Fulltext\/2013\/08002\/Feasibility_of_blind_aortic_catheter_placement_in.13.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23883904"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/2013\/08002\/Feasibility_of_blind_aortic_catheter_placement_in.13.pdf","pmid":"23883904","pubdate":"2013-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"S173","title":"Feasibility of blind aortic catheter placement in the prehospital environment to guide resuscitation in cardiac arrest.","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/feasibility-blind-aortic-catheter-placement-prehospital-environment-guide-resuscitation-cardiac-arre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8301606,"mean":6.997804255434,"rank":4419202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2310797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8301606,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186308,"mean":7.6978424643198,"rank":90102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":75670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186308,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2623,"mean":6.6780823798627,"rank":1785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2623,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":6.7753469387755,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
