The association is a mutualistic symbiosis with the fungi enhancing nutrient capture for the plant while obtaining carbon in return. Although arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) lack any substantial saprophytic capability they do preferentially associate with various organic substrates and respond by hyphal proliferation, indicating the fungus derives a benefit from the organic substrate. AMF may also enhance decomposition of the organic material. The benefit to the host plant of this hyphal proliferation is not always apparent, particularly regarding nitrogen (N) transfer, and there may be circumstances under which both symbionts compete for the N released given both have a large demand for N. The results of various studies examining AMF responses to organic substrates and the interactions with other members of the soil community will be discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc97","authors":["Angela Hodge"],"doi":"10.1016\/b978-0-12-800259-9.00002-0","first_seen_on":"2014-08-19T10:01:51+00:00","funders":["bbsrc"],"issns":["0065-2164","00652164"],"journal":"Advances in applied microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1417787708,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25131400?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/B9780128002599000020"],"pmid":"25131400","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Academic Press Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Chapter Two Interactions Between Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi and Organic Material Substrates ","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interactions-between-arbuscular-mycorrhizal-fungi-organic-material-substrates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7873010,"mean":6.6681614282358,"rank":3248417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4574998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7873010,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184249,"mean":7.5125075333249,"rank":59723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":122852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184249,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":3.8753157894737,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
