This review will concentrate on the role of reactive species of oxygen in the pathophysiology of organ dysfunction, specifically sub arachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as global central nervous system (CNS) hypoxic, ischemic and reperfusion states. We enumerate potential therapeutic modalities that are been currently investigated and of interest for future trials. Antioxidants are perhaps the next frontier of translational research, especially in neuro-anesthesiology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7053cf058f61000a4bd","authors":["Tewari A","Mahendru V","Sinha A","Bilotta F"],"doi":"10.4103\/0970-9185.130001","first_seen_on":"2014-08-18T22:34:32+00:00","issns":["0970-9185"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Anaesthesiology Clinical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1408130269,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24803750"],"pmcid":"PMC4009632","pmid":"24803750","pubdate":"2014-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Antioxidants: The new frontier for translational research in cerebroprotection.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antioxidants-new-frontier-translational-research-cerebroprotection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3075138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112983,"mean":7.9561951638315,"rank":73771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":28409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112983,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258,"mean":0.94124513618677,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
