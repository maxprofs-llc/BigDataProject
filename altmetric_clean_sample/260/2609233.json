Using 1992-2011 National Health Interview Surveys, obesity, overweight, and BMI differentials were analyzed by logistic, linear, and log-linear regression. Between 1992 and 2011, obesity prevalence doubled for the Chinese, the Asian Indians, the Japanese, and the Hawaiians\/Pacific Islanders; and tripled for the Filipinos. Obesity prevalence among API adults tripled from 3.7% in 1992 to 13.3% in 2010, and overweight prevalence doubled from 23.2% to 43.1%. Immigrants in each API subgroup had lower prevalence than their US-born counterparts, with immigrants' obesity and overweight risks increasing with increasing duration of residence. During 2006-2011, obesity prevalence ranged from 3.3% for Chinese immigrants to 22.3% for the US-born Filipinos and 41.1% for the Native Hawaiians\/Pacific Islanders. The Asian Indians, the Filipinos, and the Hawaiians\/Pacific Islanders had, respectively, 3.1, 3.8, and 10.9 times higher odds of obesity than those of the Chinese adults. Compared with Chinese immigrants, the adjusted odds of obesity were 3.5-4.6 times higher for the US-born Chinese and the foreign-born Filipinos, 9 times higher for the US-born Filipinos and whites, 3.8-5.5 times higher for the US-born and foreign-born Asian Indians, and 21.9 times higher for the Native Hawaiians. Substantial ethnic heterogeneity and rising prevalence underscore the need for increased monitoring of obesity and obesity-related risk factors among API subgroups.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Singh GK","Lin SC"],"doi":"10.5402\/2013\/898691","first_seen_on":"2014-08-19T17:50:05+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"ISRN Preventive Med","last_mentioned_on":1407951442,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24967142"],"pmid":"24967142","pubdate":"2014-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Dramatic Increases in Obesity and Overweight Prevalence among Asian Subgroups in the United States, 1992-2011.","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dramatic-increases-obesity-overweight-prevalence-among-asian-subgroups-united-states-19922011"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
