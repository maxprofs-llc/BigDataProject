Here we introduce a homogenous HLA-DQA1\u221705 end-point PCR assay based on switchable lanthanide luminescence probe technology and a simple dried blood sample preparation. The switchable probe technology is based on two non-luminescent oligonucleotide probes, one carrying a non-luminescent lanthanide chelate and the other a light absorbing antenna ligand. Hybridization of the probes in adjacent positions to the target DNA leads to the formation of a highly luminescent lanthanide chelate complex by self-assembly of the reporter molecules. Performance of the HLA-DQA1\u221705 assay was evaluated by testing blood samples collected on sample collection cards and prepared by lysing the punched samples (3 mm discs) using alkaline reaction conditions and high temperature. Testing of 147 blood samples yielded 100% correlation to the heterogenous DELFIA-technology based reference assay. Genotyping requires carefully designed probe sequences able to discriminate matched and mismatched target sequences by hybridization. Furthermore, definite genotype discrimination was achieved because inherently non-luminescent switchable probes together with time-resolved measurement mode lead to very low background signal level and, therefore, very high signal differences in average of 54 fold between DQA1\u221705 and other alleles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224b","authors":["Lehmusvuori A","Kiviniemi M","Ilonen J","Soukka T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ab.2014.07.029","first_seen_on":"2014-08-19T00:27:26+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Analytical Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1443780664,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25120130?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25120130?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25120130","pubdate":"2014-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Closed-tube HLA-DQA1\u221705 genotyping assay based on switchable lanthanide luminescence probes.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/closedtube-human-leukocyte-antigen-dqa105-genotyping-assay-based-switchable-lanthanide-luminescence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":5470879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141862,"mean":8.4485120646268,"rank":113879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141862,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":833,"mean":2.3479951923077,"rank":636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":833,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.17,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
