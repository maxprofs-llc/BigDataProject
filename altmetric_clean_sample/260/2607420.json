Material collected in Bahia and Cear\u00e1 states represent the first records of this genus from Northeastern Brazil and reveal five new species of Ochrotrichia. These are described and illustrated in this paper: O. caatinga sp. nov. (O. aldama group, from Cear\u00e1), O. priapo sp. nov. (O. aldama group, from Bahia); O. limeirai sp. nov. (O. aldama group, from Cear\u00e1), O. constricta sp. nov. (undetermined group, from Bahia), and O. igrapiuna sp. nov. (O. xena group, from Bahia). Ochrotrichia manuensis Flint & Bueno-Soria 1999 is firstly recorded from Brazil and O. patulosa (Wasmund & Holzenthal 2007) is firstly recorded from Northeastern Brazil.\u00a0","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008daf","authors":["WAGNER RAFAEL M.
