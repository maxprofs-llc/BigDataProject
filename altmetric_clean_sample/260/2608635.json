In this article we explore how stewardship may be useful to the theory and practice of mental health policy, and, reciprocally, how examples from mental health policy may elucidate the dynamics of stewardship. After examining its key political ingredients--authority, advocacy, and analysis--we discuss the practical challenges in moving stewardship from moral inspiration to institutional reality.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f61000188d","authors":["Lawrence D.
