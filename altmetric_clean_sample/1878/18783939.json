VE-cadherin is aberrantly overexpressed in vasculogenic cancer cells and regarded as a master gene of tumor VM. Although micro RNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in modulating tumor angiogenesis and cancer metastasis, the miRNA which targets VE-cadherin expression in cancer cells to inhibit tumor cell-mediated VM is enigmatic. In this study, we found that miR-27b levels are negatively co-related to VE-cadherin expression in ovarian cancer cells and tumor cell-mediated VM, and demonstrated that miR-27b could bind to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of VE-cadherin mRNA. Overexpression of miR-27b in aggressive ovarian cancer cell lines Hey1B and ES2 significantly diminished intracellular VE-cadherin expression; convincingly, the inhibitory effect of miR-27b could be reversed by miR-27b specific inhibitor. Intriguingly, miR-27b not only effectively suppressed ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion, but also markedly inhibited formation of ovarian cancer cells-mediated capillary-like structure in vitro and suppressed generation of functional tumor blood vessels in mice. Together, our study suggests that miR-27b functions as a new inhibitor of ovarian cancer cell-mediated VM through suppression of VE-cadherin expression, providing a new potential drug candidate for anti-tumor VM and anti-ovarian cancer therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008844","authors":["Liu, Wenming","Lv, Chunping","Zhang, Bin","Zhou, Quansheng","Cao, Zhifei","Wenming Liu","Chunping Lv","Bin Zhang","Quansheng Zhou","Zhifei Cao"],"doi":"10.1261\/rna.059592.116","first_seen_on":"2017-04-12T23:48:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1355-8382","1469-9001"],"journal":"RNA","last_mentioned_on":1498343513,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28396577?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/rnajournal.cshlp.org\/content\/early\/2017\/04\/10\/rna.059592.116.abstract","http:\/\/rnajournal.cshlp.org\/content\/early\/2017\/04\/10\/rna.059592.116.short?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1261\/rna.059592.116"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rnajournal.cshlp.org\/content\/early\/2017\/04\/10\/rna.059592.116.full.pdf","pmid":"28396577","pubdate":"2017-04-13T22:15:22+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"MicroRNA-27b functions as a new inhibitor of ovarian cancer-mediated vasculogenic mimicry through suppression of VE-cadherin expression","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna27b-functions-new-inhibitor-ovarian-cancermediated-vasculogenic-mimicry-through-suppression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.75,"score_history":{"1y":10.75,"6m":10.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":810700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7603711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251559,"mean":13.022576694042,"rank":38641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":212713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251559,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1742,"mean":4.5506731763354,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":1576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1742,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":10.372222222222,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/852307366024429568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18783939],"posted_on":"2017-04-12T23:48:05+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
