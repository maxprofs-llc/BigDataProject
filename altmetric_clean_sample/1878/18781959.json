In the past several years, increasing attention has been paid to the drug, both for its potential use as a disease-modifying antirheumatic agent and for its propensity to engender untoward autoimmune reactions, including serum sickness-like disease, drug-induced lupus, and autoimmune hepatitis. This paper reviews the evidence for minocycline as an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent, its utility in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and the spectrum of adverse reactions that have been ascribed to the drug in the past 5 years.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005869","authors":["Eichenfield, A H"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-12T20:35:40+00:00","issns":["1040-8703"],"issue":"5","journal":"Current opinion in pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1463410165,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10555598"],"pmid":"10555598","pubdate":"1999-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Minocycline and autoimmunity.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/minocycline-autoimmunity-editorial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7705951,"mean":6.6114203323351,"rank":6666260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7705951,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190745,"mean":12.025966698821,"rank":154536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190745,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":600,"mean":3.8201302170284,"rank":509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":600,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.0375,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Lecturer":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Minocycline and autoimmunity. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1114392011958274&id=674483749282438","license":"public","citation_ids":[18781959],"posted_on":"2016-05-16T14:49:25+00:00","summary":"From 1999, who knew?","author":{"name":"DRESS Syndrome","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/674483749282438","facebook_wall_name":"DRESS Syndrome","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/674483749282438\/picture","id_on_source":"674483749282438"}}]}}
