This group is also known to frequently use the emergency department (ED) for asthma care. Understanding decisions for use of the ED is important to prevent high cost.\nTo examine caregiver factors associated with the decision to use the ED for asthma care in inner-city children with asthma.\nOne hundred fifty participants in a randomized clinical trial testing the effectiveness of a home-based asthma intervention were enrolled, and questionnaires were administered to caregivers during the child's ED asthma visit. Sociodemographics, health characteristic data, and caregiver interview data were examined to ascertain factors that affected caregiver decision making to use the ED for asthma care. A cluster analysis was performed to correlate caregiver reasons for the decision to use the ED for asthma care.\nThree clusters emerged for decision making: urgency, preference for the use of the ED, and access to care issues. The perception of urgency was the most common reason reported by caregivers (91%) followed by reporting a preference for the ED for care (37%) and reporting access to care issues (31%). Access to care was primarily attributable to the inability to get a same-day appointment with their primary care practitioner (24%).\nThe caregiver factors involved in the decision to use the ED can provide a basis for further intervention and investigation. Such factors include caregiver asthma home management, improvement in relationships with primary care practitioners, and access to care-related issues.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005723","authors":["Shawna S.
