Treatment is generally by antibiotic therapy with metronidazole and vancomycin, but efficacy remains suboptimal. Areas Covered: This review discusses established and emerging treatment options for CDI, and current therapeutic guidelines, taking into account disease severity and risk of relapse. Expert Commentary: New therapeutic approaches, including antibodies and new classes of antibiotics, and new measures for preventing infection with vaccines are under development in phase II\/III clinical trials. We performed a systematic literature review using the search terms 'Clostridium difficile' and 'treatment'.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073ce","authors":["C.F. Manthey","L. Eckmann","V.
