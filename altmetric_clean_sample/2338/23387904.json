While macrosomia, lithotomy position and forceps use are well-identified causes of peripheral nerve injuries, additional contributors such as patient condition and anaesthesia care may also have to be considered.\nWe performed a case-control study nested in a cohort of 19,840 patients having neuraxial anaesthesia for childbirth. Cases were all patients who developed motor or sensory dysfunction of lower extremities in the post-partum period. These were compared, using Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, logistic regression and time series, to a random sample of controls without any neurological symptoms or injury.\nWe identified 19 (0.96\u2030) patients with peripheral nerve injuries of which 15 (0.76\u2030) were likely associated with obstetrical care. In four additional cases (0.20\u2030), a nerve root injury due to the Tuohy needle was suspected. Univariate risk factors were: a gestational age \u2265\u00a041\u00a0weeks, Odds Ratio (OR) 3.8; 95% CI: 1.1-13.1, late initiation of neuraxial anaesthesia OR 8.2; 95% CI: 1.8-37.9, a repeated anaesthetic procedure OR 2.8; 95% CI: 1.0-7.8, assisted delivery with forceps OR 9.8; 95% CI: 1.2-114.1 and newborn birth weight >\u00a03.5\u00a0kg with an OR 6.8; 95% CI: 2.0-22.5.\nObstetrical related factors are the most prominent risk associated with peripheral nerve injuries. This study highlights however that patient and anaesthesia-related factors may also contribute to peripheral nerve injuries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002143","authors":["Haller, G.","Pichon, I.","Gay, F.-O.","Savoldelli, G.","Gay, F.\u2010O."],"doi":"10.1111\/aas.12951","first_seen_on":"2017-08-03T10:04:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0001-5172","1399-6576","00015172"],"journal":"Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1503231199,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28766691?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/aas.12951\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/aas.12951\/pdf","pmid":"28766691","pubdate":"2017-08-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Risk factors for peripheral nerve injuries following neuraxial labour analgesia: a nested case-control study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-peripheral-nerve-injuries-following-neuraxial-labour-analgesia-nested-casecontrol-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":6377675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1140432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215987,"mean":12.698348226274,"rank":153637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":38680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215987,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":962,"mean":2.6044745057232,"rank":646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":962,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":6.1027777777778,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/893049955950231552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23387904],"posted_on":"2017-08-03T10:04:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
