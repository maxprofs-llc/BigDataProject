A clinical examination including standardized ultrasound was performed, which revealed a choroidal mass with cystic-like cavitation. The patient underwent brachytherapy with regression of the tumor.\nWe report the features of a cavitary choroidal metastasis from clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Occurrence of features usually associated with uveal melanoma in a patient with a metastatic choroidal tumor may lead to misdiagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083e1","authors":["Ayres, Bernadete","McClendon, Tanya","Demirci, Hakan"],"doi":"10.1097\/opx.0000000000001097","first_seen_on":"2017-08-03T08:41:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1040-5488"],"issue":"8","journal":"Optometry and Vision Science","last_mentioned_on":1501749665,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/optvissci\/Abstract\/2017\/08000\/Cavitary_Choroidal_Metastasis_from_Clear_Cell.9.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/optvissci\/2017\/08000\/Cavitary_Choroidal_Metastasis_from_Clear_Cell.9.pdf","pmid":"28692599","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"851","subjects":["optometry"],"title":"Cavitary Choroidal Metastasis from Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/optvissci\/Fulltext\/2017\/08000\/Cavitary_Choroidal_Metastasis_from_Clear_Cell.9.aspx","volume":"94"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":6311337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1126037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175624,"mean":11.836065686157,"rank":124258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175624,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1302,"mean":5.8207209838586,"rank":936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1302,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":4.885,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HargraveCenter\/statuses\/893028939723145216","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23386440],"posted_on":"2017-08-03T08:41:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Hargrave Eye Center","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/hargraveeyecenter","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/458688906616004608\/2t7LIZGj_normal.jpeg","description":"The Hargrave Eye Center is a well respected, full-service ophthalmic center at the Methodist Dallas Medical Center operated by Dr. Sylvia Hargrave.","id_on_source":"HargraveCenter","tweeter_id":"2458541456","geo":{"lt":32.78306,"ln":-96.80667,"country":"US"},"followers":1302},"tweet_id":"893028939723145216"}]}}
