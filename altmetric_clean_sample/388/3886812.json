The plan of care is usually developed around the needs of the affected person, with focus on safety and quality of life. In caring for these individuals, the clinician is faced with an even greater task of supporting the caregiver and identifying caregiver fatigue and burden. Improving the competence and knowledge of caregivers is valuable in minimizing burden. Home care clinicians have the knowledge, skills, and resources to ease the burden of caregiving and prolong the time that the person with dementia can remain in the home. This article describes current research and approaches to care, specifically with problems involving behavior, functional limitations, and safety.","altmetric_jid":"567418d42a83ee1a768b4569","authors":["Villapando, Maria Victoria"],"doi":"10.1097\/nhh.0000000000000223","first_seen_on":"2015-04-08T03:57:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2374-4537","2374-4529"],"issue":"4","journal":"Home Healthcare Now","last_mentioned_on":1428465424,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/homehealthcarenurseonline\/Fulltext\/2015\/04000\/Lightening_the_Load__An_Overview_of_Caregiver.3.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/homehealthcarenurseonline\/Fulltext\/2015\/04000\/Lightening_the_Load__An_Overview_of_Caregiver.3.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/homehealthcarenurseonline\/2015\/04000\/Lightening_the_Load__An_Overview_of_Caregiver.3.pdf","pmid":"25828609","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"190","title":"Lightening the Load: An Overview of Caregiver Burden in Dementia Care","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lightening-load-overview-caregiver-burden-dementia-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4973997,"mean":5.8881186699807,"rank":3318165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1455828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4973997,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149506,"mean":10.120978321795,"rank":102674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":39765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149506,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":0.93548387096774,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.9375,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
