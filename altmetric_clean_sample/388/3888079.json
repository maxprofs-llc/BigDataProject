Six major and some minor peaks were observed for the N-glycans in fetuin, which were well separated from each other using 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing SDS to a concentration of 30 mM in an uncoated fused-silica capillary, and these peaks were assigned to sialo-N-glycans having either of the biantennary or beta1-3\/beta1-4 linked galactose-containing complex type triantennary N-glycans as the basic structures, by an indirect method based on the assignment of the peaks in high-performance liquid chromatography separated in parallel with CE and peak collation between these two separation methods. The attaching position of the sialic acid residue was determined using the linkage preference of neuraminidase isozymes. The established system is considered to be useful for routine analysis of microheterogeneity of the carbohydrate moiety of this model glycoprotein from the following reasons: (1) the derivatization with PMP proceeds quantitatively under mild conditions without causing release of the sialic acid residue, (2) the derivatives can be sensitively detected by UV absorption, (3) the procedure is simple, rapid and reproducible. Preliminary results of N-glycan analysis for several other glycoproteins under these conditions are also presented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["Suzuki, S","Tanaka, R","Takada, K","Inoue, N","Yashima, Y","Honda, A","Honda, S"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0021-9673(00)01228-0","first_seen_on":"2015-04-08T13:04:20+00:00","issns":["00219673","0021-9673"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Chromatography A","last_mentioned_on":1428498185,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021967300012280"],"pmid":"11261727","pubdate":"2015-10-22T10:18:43+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Analysis of sialo-N-glycans in glycoproteins as 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone derivatives by capillary electrophoresis ","type":"article","volume":"910","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-sialonglycans-glycoproteins-1phenyl3methyl5pyrazolone-derivatives-capillary-electrophoresis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4973924,"mean":5.8880810322163,"rank":3518278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":814827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4973924,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149525,"mean":10.120665338006,"rank":109765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":24172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149525,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2058,"mean":1.8880894506563,"rank":1041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2058,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.1966666666667,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
