Collaborating with patients, acknowledging stigma, ensuring inclusive systems and procedures, navigating health care, and providing holistic care emerged as key elements for best practice. Advocacy was a crucial part of care provision.\nSuggestions are provided for therapists to ensure that space and interactions are welcoming to transgender clients as well as suggestions for occupational therapy intervention in the transitioning process.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d13cf058f610000bd1","authors":["Beagan BL","Chiasson A","Fiske CA","Forseth SD","Hosein AC","Myers MR","Stang JE","Brenda L.
