Cavitand 4 exhibits a chelating N3Ni(\u03bc-S)2NiN3 moiety with two square-pyramidal Ni(II)N3S2 units situated in an anion binding pocket of \u223c4 \u00c5 diameter formed by the organic backbone of the (L(Me2H4))(2-) macrocycle. The receptor reacts with fluoride, chloride (in MeCN\/MeOH), and bromide (in MeCN) ions to afford an isostructural series of halogenido-bridged complexes [Ni2(L(Me2H4))(\u03bc-Hal)](+) (Hal = F(-) (5), Cl(-) (6), and Br(-) (7)) featuring a N3Ni(\u03bc-S)2(\u03bc-Hal)NiN3 core structure. No reaction occurs with iodide or other polyatomic anions (ClO4(-), NO3(-), HCO3(-), H2PO4(-), HSO4(-), SO4(2-)). The binding events are accompanied by discrete UV-vis spectral changes, due to a switch of the coordination geometry from square-pyramidal (N3S2 donor set in 4) to octahedral in the halogenido-bridged complexes (N3S2Hal donor environment in 5-7). In MeCN\/MeOH (1\/1 v\/v) the log K11 values for the 1:1 complexes are 7.77(9) (F(-)), 4.06(7) (Cl(-)), and 2.0(1) (Br(-)). X-ray crystallographic analyses for 4(ClO4)2, 4(I)2, 5(F), 6(ClO4), and 7(Br) and computational studies reveal a significant increase of the intramolecular distance between two propylene groups at the cavity entrance upon going from F(-) to I(-) (for the DFT computed structure). In case of the receptor 4 and fluorido-bridged complex 5, the corresponding distances are nearly identical. This indicates a high degree of preorganization of the [Ni2(L(Me2H4))](2+) receptor and a size fit mismatch of the receptor binding cavity for anions larger than F(-).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Alexander Jeremies"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b00123","first_seen_on":"2015-04-06T17:22:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1428368425,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b00123"],"pmid":"25844816","pubdate":"2015-04-07T22:00:26+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Cavitands Incorporating a Lewis Acid Dinickel Chelate Function as Receptors for Halide Anions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cavitands-incorporating-lewis-acid-dinickel-chelate-function-receptors-halide-anions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4968581,"mean":5.8840996626831,"rank":3514631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":813827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4968581,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148231,"mean":10.151283559334,"rank":108633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":24002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148231,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7094,"mean":1.0401567742845,"rank":2842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":3235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7094,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323,"mean":1.1768633540373,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
