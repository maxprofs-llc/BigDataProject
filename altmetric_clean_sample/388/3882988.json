We conducted this study to evaluate risk factors for 12-week mortality in patients with hVISA bacteremia through a detailed clinical and microbiological analysis of a prospective cohort of patients with S. aureus bacteremia. All isolates were collected on the first day of bacteremia and subjected to population analysis profiling for hVISA detection, genotyping, and PCR analysis for 39 virulence factors. Of 382 patient with MRSA bacteremia, 121 (32%) had hVISA bacteremia. Deceased patients were more likely to have hematologic malignancy (P = 0.033), ultimately or rapidly fatal disease (P = 0.007), and higher Pitt bacteremia score (P = 0.010), than surviving patients. ST239 clonal type and definitive linezolid treatment were associated with a trend towards reduced mortality (P = 0.061 and 0.072, respectively) but high vancomycin MIC (\u22652 mg\/L) was not associated with increased mortality (P = 0.368). In a multivariate analysis, ultimately or rapidly fatal disease (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-6.85) and a high Pitt bacteremia score (aOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.48) were independent risk factors for mortality. Hematologic malignancy was associated with a trend towards increased mortality (P = 0.094) and ST239 was associated with a trend towards reduced mortality (P = 0.095). Our study suggests that ST239-hVISA is a possible predictor of survival in hVISA bacteremia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Yong Pil Chong","Ki-Ho Park","Eun Sil Kim","Mi-Na Kim","Sung-Han Kim","Sang-Oh Lee","Sang-Ho Choi","Jin-Yong Jeong","Jun Hee Woo","Yang Soo Kim","Chong, Yong Pil","Park, Ki-Ho","Kim, Eun Sil","Kim, Mi-Na","Kim, Sung-Han","Lee, Sang-Oh","Choi, Sang-Ho","Jeong, Jin-Yong","Woo, Jun Hee","Kim, Yang Soo"],"doi":"10.1128\/aac.04765-14","first_seen_on":"2015-04-07T06:46:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-6596"],"journal":"Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1457437481,"links":["http:\/\/aac.asm.org\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/31\/AAC.04765-14.abstract?RESULTFORMAT=&andorexactfulltext=and&andorexacttitle=and&andorexacttitleabs=and&ct=&fulltext=MRSA&hits=1&maxtoshow=&resourcetype=HWCIT&searchid=1&usestrictdates=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25845875?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/aac.asm.org\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/31\/AAC.04765-14.full.pdf","pmid":"25845875","pubdate":"2015-04-08T22:05:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Risk factors for mortality in patients with heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a clinical and microbiologic analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-microbiologic-analysis-risk-factors-mortality-patients-heterogeneous-vancomycinintermediate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7367623,"mean":6.4006371575483,"rank":3047398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4214106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7367623,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196873,"mean":9.1062092628714,"rank":77790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":115121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196873,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5337,"mean":6.7247623688156,"rank":2942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":2317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5337,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":2.4632478632479,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
