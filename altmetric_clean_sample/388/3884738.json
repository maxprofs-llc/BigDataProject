The transcription factor SCL\/TAL1 controls human HSPC but its mechanism of action is not clarified. In the present study we show that knock-down (KD) or short term conditional over-expression (OE) of TAL1 in human HSPC ex-vivo respectively blocks and maintains hematopoietic potentials, affecting proliferation of human HSPC. Comparative gene expression analyses of TAL1\/KD and TAL1\/OE human HSPC revealed modifications of cell cycle regulators as well as previously described TAL1 target genes. Interestingly an inverse correlation between TAL1 and DNA damage induced transcript 4 (DDiT4\/REDD1), an inhibitor of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is uncovered. Low phosphorylation levels of mTOR target proteins in TAL1\/KD HSPC confirmed an interplay between mTOR pathway and TAL1 in correlation with TAL1-mediated effects of HSPC proliferation. Finally chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments performed in human HSPC showed that DDiT4 is a direct TAL1 target gene. Functional analyses showed that TAL1 represses DDiT4 expression in HSPCs. These results pinpoint DDiT4\/REDD1 as a novel target gene regulated by TAL1 in human HSPC and establish for the first time a link between TAL1 and the mTOR pathway in human early hematopoietic cells.
