However, the task of generating excited states with long lifetimes has been met with limited success, owing to the ultrafast deactivation of the highly active excited states. Here, we present a design rule that can be used to tune the emission lifetime of a wide range of luminescent organic molecules, based on effective stabilization of triplet excited states through strong coupling in H-aggregated molecules. Our experimental data revealed that luminescence lifetimes up to 1.35 s, which are several orders of magnitude longer than those of conventional organic fluorophores, can be realized under ambient conditions. These results outline a fundamental principle to design organic molecules with extended lifetimes of excited states, providing a major step forward in expanding the scope of organic phosphorescence\u00a0applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000426b","authors":["Zhongfu An","Chao Zheng","Ye Tao","Runfeng Chen","Huifang Shi","Ting Chen","Zhixiang Wang","Huanhuan Li","Renren Deng","Xiaogang Liu","Wei Huang"],"doi":"10.1038\/nmat4259","first_seen_on":"2015-04-08T13:21:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-1122","1476-4660"],"journal":"Nature Materials","last_mentioned_on":1428499293,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/doi:10.1038\/nmat4259.epdf?shared_access_token=mDuCdNaF5fd-vd6_djusPdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Nt0AW3JYWgWUTOM5jaUPo6HkanYavZok80H-DV_hr1OVNgGmiz4lNOMg35sE2aLCnddw51WSBrQcc1MKWJUfX-5lUTvYZ2X3cLRlk-ugCUubaCzcuQ9hnsjiaZv3fCWYuALZRZ4tGz-4zuYjElUMKlGs3qsyCfw1Q8U5bL1f-a6g%3D%3D","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nmat\/journal\/v14\/n7\/abs\/nmat4259.html"],"pmid":"25849370","pubdate":"2015-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Materials for optics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","science"],"title":"Stabilizing triplet excited states for ultralong organic phosphorescence","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stabilizing-triplet-excited-states-ultralong-organic-phosphorescence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7907272,"mean":6.6921289919055,"rank":5996624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1060735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7907272,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201413,"mean":9.1829539947968,"rank":142225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":30848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201413,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1769,"mean":28.640852941176,"rank":1644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1769,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":32.418192307692,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":13,"Researcher":28,"Student  > Ph.
