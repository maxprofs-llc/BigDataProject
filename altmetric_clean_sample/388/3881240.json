At present, three most NGS platforms are used in genetics for clonally amplified templates. These technologies share general processing steps but differing in specific technical details that determine their limits or advantages. NGS has been recently shown to have great potential for identifying novel causative mutations in different disorders. It is expected that the NGS will be increasingly important in the study of inherited and complex traits such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Indeed, the identification and characterization of genes that enhance prediction of CVDs risk remain an important challenge for improving prevention and treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Vecoli, Cecilia"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-2572-8_4","first_seen_on":"2015-04-06T18:36:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1428392611,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25836574?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25836574?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25836574","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Next-generation sequencing technology in the genetics of cardiovascular disease.","type":"article","volume":"1299","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nextgeneration-sequencing-technology-genetics-cardiovascular-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4968604,"mean":5.8841361497417,"rank":2462745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2355471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4968604,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148218,"mean":10.151852432582,"rank":78482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":63248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148218,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3727,"mean":1.4947096081589,"rank":921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":2655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3727,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":1.0849019607843,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/spenagon\/status\/585148846604431361","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3881240],"posted_on":"2015-04-06T18:35:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Santiago de la Pe\u00f1a","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2238120599\/AIbEiAIAAABECI2N-7z__bHhuwEiC3ZjYXJkX3Bob3RvKihmNDNkZDY3MzhiNjBkOTdhNjE5OTI0ZTZiNGFlNDk2ODc2MjcwZmE0MAHjgpFs9RRjsxk24xIU_7g53R39sw_normal.jpg","description":"Bioinformatician.
