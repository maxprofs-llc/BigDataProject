However, diagnostic tools other than polymerase chain reaction for PDCoV detection were lacking and Koch\u05f3s postulates had not been fulfilled to confirm the pathogenic potential of PDCoV. In the present study, PDCoV peptide-specific rabbit antisera were developed and used in immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays to assist PDCoV diagnostics. The pathogenicity and pathogenesis of PDCoV was investigated following orogastric inoculation of 5-day-old piglets with a plaque-purified PDCoV cell culture isolate (3\u00d710(4) TCID50 per pig). The PDCoV-inoculated piglets developed mild to moderate diarrhea, shed increasing amount of virus in rectal swabs from 2 to 7 days post inoculation, and developed macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestines with viral antigen confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining. This study experimentally confirmed PDCoV pathogenicity and characterized PDCoV pathogenesis in neonatal piglets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003769","authors":["Chen, Qi","Gauger, Phillip","Stafne, Molly","Thomas, Joseph","Arruda, Paulo","Burrough, Eric","Madson, Darin","Brodie, Joseph","Magstadt, Drew","Derscheid, Rachel","Welch, Michael","Zhang, Jianqiang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.virol.2015.03.024","first_seen_on":"2015-04-07T15:22:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-0341","00426822"],"journal":"Virology","last_mentioned_on":1428420135,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0042682215001609"],"pmid":"25817405","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Pathogenicity and pathogenesis of a United States porcine deltacoronavirus cell culture isolate in 5-day-old neonatal piglets ","type":"article","volume":"482","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathogenicity-pathogenesis-united-states-porcine-deltacoronavirus-cell-culture-isolate-5dayold-neona"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4968581,"mean":5.8840996626831,"rank":3514607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":813829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4968581,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148592,"mean":10.142208047594,"rank":109084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":23949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148592,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1645,"mean":3.2782871046229,"rank":1272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1645,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":4.0142608695652,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
