The secondary purpose was to inform knowledge translation strategies for concussion researchers and practitioners.\nResearch on concussion education programmes is relatively new. As a result, the current study implemented a scoping review methodology, which is a type of literary search used to provide a preliminary assessment of the size and scope of a body of literature, as well as identify strengths, weaknesses and gaps in the research.\nA five-stage process for conducting a scoping review was followed for this study: (a) identifying the research questions, (b) identifying relevant studies, (c) identifying the study selection criteria, (d) charting the data and (e) reporting the results.\nConcussion education programmes have been developed and implemented with populations ranging in age from 9 to 49\u2005years and have used interactive oral presentations, educational videos and computer-based learning programmes. Although the content of these programmes varied, the topics generally addressed salient aspects of concussion injury and recovery. Quantitative instruments have been the preferred methods for assessment.\nEducation programmes aimed at improving participants' long-term concussion knowledge, behaviours and attitudes of concussions are needed. Researchers must consider using a knowledge translation framework to enhance concussion education programmes. The application of such a framework can lead to novel and interesting ways of disseminating information about concussive injury and recovery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002adf","authors":["Jeffrey G Caron","Gordon A Bloom","William R Falc\u00e3o","Shane N Sweet","Caron, Jeffrey G","Bloom, Gordon A","Falc\u00e3o, William R","Sweet, Shane N"],"doi":"10.1136\/injuryprev-2014-041479","endpage":"308","first_seen_on":"2015-04-06T09:21:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-5785","1353-8047"],"issue":"5","journal":"Injury Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1480531363,"links":["http:\/\/injuryprevention.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/30\/injuryprev-2014-041479.short","http:\/\/injuryprevention.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/30\/injuryprev-2014-041479.long","http:\/\/injuryprevention.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/30\/injuryprev-2014-041479.short?g=w_injuryprevention_ahead_tab","http:\/\/injuryprevention.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/30\/injuryprev-2014-041479.abstract?sid=760d9e2f-4262-4d77-b8f5-b4f26f1ccf3e","http:\/\/injuryprevention.bmj.com\/content\/21\/5\/301.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/injuryprevention.bmj.com\/content\/21\/5\/301.full","http:\/\/injuryprevention.bmj.com\/content\/21\/5\/301.abstract?sid=e6a79bb7-5150-4615-8708-d0408ea10783","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25825353\/","http:\/\/injuryprevention.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/30\/injuryprev-2014-041479.abstract","http:\/\/injuryprevention.bmj.com\/content\/21\/5\/301.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=gplus"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/injuryprevention.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/30\/injuryprev-2014-041479.full.pdf","pmid":"25825353","pubdate":"2015-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"301","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"An examination of concussion education programmes: a scoping review methodology","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/examination-concussion-education-programmes-scoping-review-methodology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":28.328,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":28.328},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8015599,"mean":6.7744178899646,"rank":291101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7725403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8015599,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201003,"mean":9.24574019164,"rank":11561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":189442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201003,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1122,"mean":14.234176628011,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1122,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":7.0135428571429,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":14,"researcher":1,"practitioner":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":14,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
