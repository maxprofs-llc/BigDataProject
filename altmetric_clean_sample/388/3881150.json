The 1:1 reactions between MX5 (M = Nb, Ta; X = Cl, Br) and a series of \u03b1-amino acids resulted in the formation of the iminium salts [(R)CH\u2550NR'R\u20332][MX6] (R = CH2Ph, R' = R\u2033 = Me: M = Nb, X = Cl, 2a; M = Nb, X = Br, 2b; M = Ta, X = Cl, 2c; M = Ta, X = Br, 2d; R = CH2Ph, R' = R\u2033 = H, M = Nb: X = Cl, 3a; X = Br, 3b; R = CH2CHMe2, R' = R\u2033 = H, M = Nb, X = Cl, 4; R = R' = H, R\u2033 = Me, M = Nb, X = Cl, 5). The formate\/amino acidate derivative NbCl3(O2CH)[O2CCH(CH2Ph)NMe2], 6, was isolated and identified as coproduct of the 1:1 reaction between NbCl5 and N,N-dimethyl-l-phenylalanine, leading to 2a. All of the compounds were characterized by analytical and spectroscopic methods and by X-ray diffractometry in the cases of 2a, 2b, and 2d. Moreover, density functional theory studies were carried out to shed light on mechanistic and structural aspects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Marco Bortoluzzi"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b00286","first_seen_on":"2015-04-06T17:51:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1428404911,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b00286"],"pmid":"25844933","pubdate":"2015-04-07T22:00:18+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of \u03b1-Amino Acidato Derivatives of Niobium and Tantalum Pentahalides and Their Conversion into Iminium Salts","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-%CE%B1amino-acidato-derivatives-niobium-tantalum-pentahalides-conversion-iminium-salts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4968604,"mean":5.8841361497417,"rank":2635860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1663428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4968604,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148216,"mean":10.151871686402,"rank":85803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":46824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148216,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7094,"mean":1.03986070774,"rank":1839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7094,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323,"mean":1.1722049689441,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/status\/585137662463311872","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3881150],"posted_on":"2015-04-06T17:51:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"585137662463311872"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InorgChem\/status\/585392851871236097","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3881150],"posted_on":"2015-04-07T10:45:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/IC","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2249495742\/ic-twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief Bill Tolman and IC staff on fundamental studies in all phases of inorganic chemistry, including bioinorganic chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorgChem","tweeter_id":"583802897","geo":{"lt":38.91706,"ln":-77.00025,"country":"US"},"followers":5711},"tweet_id":"585392851871236097"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Tolma001\/status\/585398743429677056","license":"datasift","rt":["InorgChem"],"citation_ids":[3881150],"posted_on":"2015-04-07T11:08:31+00:00","author":{"name":"William Tolman","url":"http:\/\/www.chem.umn.edu\/groups\/tolman","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/832271105985372160\/lrRpmPma_normal.jpg","description":"Professor and Chair of Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota; Editor-in-Chief of Inorganic Chemistry; Dad; bicyclist; fan of Mpls","id_on_source":"Tolma001","tweeter_id":"28503759","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1940},"tweet_id":"585398743429677056"}]}}
