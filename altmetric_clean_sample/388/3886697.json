Nonetheless, fathers' Neonatal Intensive Care Unit experience has received limited research attention.\nSystematic review of qualitative studies.\nFour electronic databases (CINHAL, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus) were explored and studies published between 2000-2014 were included. Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tool for Qualitative Studies guidelines were adopted. Key themes were extracted and synthesised.\nFive main themes resuming fathers' experience of preterm birth and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay were identified from 14 studies. Themes were: emotional roller-coaster, paternal needs, coping strategies, self-representation and caregiving engagement. These dimensions were found to be dynamically shaped across three critical turning points: preterm birth, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay and at home.\nNeonatal Intensive Care Unit fathers of preterm infants experience ambivalence, a set of different needs and coping strategies. They modify their self-representations along the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit journey and needs specific nursing support and intervention to sustain caregiving engagement and transition to parenthood.\nA systematic and deepened understanding of preterms' fathers lived experience in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit would be helpful to inform nursing practice. Specific action priorities are suggested within the frame of family-centred care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d01","authors":["Provenzi, Livio","Santoro, Elena"],"doi":"10.1111\/jocn.12828","endpage":"1794","first_seen_on":"2015-04-08T02:51:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2702"],"issue":"13-14","journal":"Journal of Clinical Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1428528252,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jocn.12828\/abstract;jsessionid=5411F14CAD8F0E2DC975663B348073AA.f01t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jocn.12828\/abstract;jsessionid=B7D5373074508647075FBD85F0C5B9A9.f04t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jocn.12828\/pdf","pmid":"25850518","pubdate":"2015-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"1784","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"The lived experience of fathers of preterm infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: a systematic review of qualitative studies","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lived-experience-fathers-preterm-infants-neonatal-intensive-care-unit-systematic-review-qualitative-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6394257,"mean":5.9816940854416,"rank":1418552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4962294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6394257,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167234,"mean":9.9014185358154,"rank":54306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":112369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167234,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1535,"mean":3.1980091264668,"rank":367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1535,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":4.4381578947368,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
