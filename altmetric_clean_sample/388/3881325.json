Growth factor independence-1 (Gfi1) is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that regulates hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, pre-T-cell differentiation, formation of granulocytes, inner ear hair cells, and the development of secretory cell types in the intestine. As GFI1\/Gfi1 is expressed in human and rodent pancreas, we characterized the potential function of Gfi1 in mouse pancreatic development.\nGfi1 knockout mice were analyzed at histological and molecular levels, including qRT-PCR, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy.\nLoss of Gfi1 impacted formation and structure of the pancreatic acinar\/centroacinar unit. Histologic and ultrastructural analysis of Gfi1-null pancreas revealed specific defects at the level of pancreatic acinar cells as well as the centroacinar cells (CACs) in\u00a0Gfi1(-\/-) mice when compared with wild-type littermates. Pancreatic endocrine differentiation, islet architecture, and function were unaffected. Organ domain patterning and the formation of ductal cells occurred normally during the\u00a0murine secondary transition (E13.5-E14.5) in the Gfi1(-\/-) pancreas. However, at later gestational time points (E18.5), expression of cellular markers for CACs was substantially reduced in Gfi1(-\/-) mice, corroborated by electron microscopy imaging of the acinar\/centroacinar unit. The reduction in CACs was correlated with an exocrine organ defect. Postnatally, Gfi1 deficiency resulted in severe pancreatic acinar dysplasia, including loss of granulation, autolytic vacuolation, and a proliferative and apoptotic response.\nGfi1 plays an important role in regulating the development of pancreatic CACs and the function of pancreatic acinar cells.","altmetric_jid":"554b85592a83ee864e8b4568","authors":["Qu, Xiaoling","Nyeng, Pia","Xiao, Fan","Dorantes, Jorge","Jensen, Jan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcmgh.2014.12.004","first_seen_on":"2015-04-06T19:17:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2352-345X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cellular and Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1428586638,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cmghjournal.org%2Farticle%2FS2352-345X%252814%252900014-9%2Ffulltext&code=jcmgh-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cmghjournal.org\/article\/S2352345X14000149\/pdf","pmid":"28247862","pubdate":"2017-03-03T22:11:14+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Growth Factor Independence-1 (Gfi1) Is Required for Pancreatic Acinar Unit Formation and Centroacinar Cell Differentiation","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/growth-factor-independence1-gfi1-required-pancreatic-acinar-unit-formation-centroacinar-cell-differe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4977898,"mean":5.8924309386106,"rank":2640821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1666854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4977898,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148412,"mean":10.148021966027,"rank":85922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":46890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148412,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":5.9087088607595,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.5833333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
