Anjum, Ritu Gill, Ma... #plantsci #botany"],"citation":{"abstract":"Sulfur (S) stands fourth in the list of major plant nutrients after N, P, and K. Sulfate (SO4 (2-)), a form of soil-S taken up by plant roots is metabolically inert. As the first committed step of S-assimilation, ATP-sulfurylase (ATP-S) catalyzes SO4 (2-)-activation and yields activated high-energy compound adenosine-5(')-phosphosulfate that is reduced to sulfide (S(2-)) and incorporated into cysteine (Cys). In turn, Cys acts as a precursor or donor of reduced S for a range of S-compounds such as methionine (Met), glutathione (GSH), homo-GSH (h-GSH), and phytochelatins (PCs). Among S-compounds, GSH, h-GSH, and PCs are known for their involvement in plant tolerance to varied abiotic stresses, Cys is a major component of GSH, h-GSH, and PCs; whereas, several key stress-metabolites such as ethylene, are controlled by Met through its first metabolite S-adenosylmethionine. With the major aim of briefly highlighting S-compound-mediated role of ATP-S in plant stress tolerance, this paper: (a) overviews ATP-S structure\/chemistry and occurrence, (b) appraises recent literature available on ATP-S roles and regulations, and underlying mechanisms in plant abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, (c) summarizes ATP-S-intrinsic regulation by major S-compounds, and (d) highlights major open-questions in the present context. Future research in the current direction can be devised based on the discussion outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b456f","authors":["Anjum, Naser A.","Gill, Ritu","Kaushik, Manjeri","Hasanuzzaman, Mirza","Pereira, Eduarda","Ahmad, Iqbal","Tuteja, Narendra","Gill, Sarvajeet S."],"doi":"10.3389\/fpls.2015.00210","first_seen_on":"2015-04-07T14:37:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-462X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Plant Science","last_mentioned_on":1432332011,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpls.2015.00210\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25904923?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3389\/fpls.2015.00210"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpls.2015.00210\/pdf","pmid":"25904923","pubdate":"2015-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"ATP-sulfurylase, sulfur-compounds, and plant stress tolerance.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atpsulfurylase-sulfurcompounds-plant-stress-tolerance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8220193,"mean":6.9627308157704,"rank":2095920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5001477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8220193,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202369,"mean":9.3603495315466,"rank":63978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":133614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202369,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5640,"mean":2.604370633091,"rank":976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":4635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5640,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":2.6524482758621,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
