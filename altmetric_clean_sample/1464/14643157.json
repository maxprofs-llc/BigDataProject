Among the participants, 600 children with RRTIs comprised the symptomatic group (RRTI group), whereas 600 healthy children were used as controls (control group). Blood samples were collected to measure serum levels of vitamins A and E by HPLC; the serum level of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D), was measured by HPLC-MS\/MS.\nSerum levels of vitamins A and E, as well as 25(OH)D, were significantly lower in the RRTI group than the control group. The conditional logistic regression model and the receiver-operating characteristic curve showed that the insufficiency or deficiency of vitamins A, D, and E was positively correlated with RRTI occurrence (p < 0.05).\nLow serum concentrations of vitamins A, D, and E were associated with RRTIs in children from northern China.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Xuguang
