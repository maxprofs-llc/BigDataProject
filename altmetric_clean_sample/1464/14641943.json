Here, we dissect the function of the key regulator of serotonin signaling-the serotonin transporter-in innate olfactory attraction to ethanol in Drosophila melanogaster. We generated a mutated version of the serotonin transporter that prolongs serotonin signaling in the synaptic cleft and is targeted via the Gal4 system to different sets of serotonergic neurons. We identified four serotonergic neurons that inhibit the olfactory attraction to ethanol and two additional neurons that counteract this inhibition by strengthening olfactory information. Our results reveal that compensation can occur on the circuit level and that serotonin has a bidirectional function in modulating the innate attraction to ethanol. Given the evolutionarily conserved nature of the serotonin transporter and serotonin, the bidirectional serotonergic mechanisms delineate a basic principle for how random behavior is switched into targeted approach behavior.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Li Xu","Jianzheng He","Andrea Kaiser","Nikolas Gr\u00e4ber","Laura Schl\u00e4ger","Yvonne Ritze","Henrike Scholz"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0167518","first_seen_on":"2016-12-10T15:30:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1481383808,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0167518"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0167518&type=printable","pmcid":"PMC5147910","pmid":"27936023","pubdate":"2016-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0167518","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A Single Pair of Serotonergic Neurons Counteracts Serotonergic Inhibition of Ethanol Attraction in Drosophila","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/single-pair-serotonergic-neurons-counteracts-serotonergic-inhibition-ethanol-attraction-drosophila"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7871308,"mean":6.6666994406334,"rank":6816443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7871308,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251534,"mean":12.300851085146,"rank":204874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251534,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110749,"mean":10.3128548958,"rank":93472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110749,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3867,"mean":12.08513554061,"rank":3068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3867,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
