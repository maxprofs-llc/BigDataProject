A logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between timing of tracheostomy and complications and mortality. To estimate the relationship between ET and outcomes related to hospital stay, a binomial-negative regression was performed. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nA total of 1134 patients were evaluated, 313 of whom underwent ET and 821 underwent LT. Early tracheostomy patients had a lower Injury Severity Score compared with their counterparts (P = 0.004) and showed lower complications (respiratory failure: odds ratio [OR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.84; acute respiratory distress syndrome: OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.30-0.64; pneumonia: OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40-0.71; septicemia: OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33-0.70; bacteremia: OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.86) than LT patients. Those with ET had lower MV days (RRadj, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.68-0.82), ICU days (RRadj, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.59-0.73), and LOS (RRadj, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.69-0.80) compared with those with LT, after adjusting for age, Injury Severity Score, and complications. However, there were no differences in mortality ratio (ORadj, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-1.01) among ET and LT patients, after adjusting for confounders.\nOur results suggested that ET reduced complications, MV days, ICU days, and LOS, having an indirect effect on mortality ratio. Standardized protocols for ET are recommended to enhance health outcomes in trauma patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc8","authors":["Romero V\u00e1zquez, Ana M.","Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, Omar","Ramos Mel\u00e9ndez, Ediel","Rodr\u00edguez Ortiz, Pablo"],"doi":"10.1097\/pts.0000000000000268","first_seen_on":"2016-12-11T04:48:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-8425","1549-8417"],"journal":"Journal of Patient Safety","last_mentioned_on":1481431697,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/Pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&issue=00000&article=99557&type=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/9000\/00000\/Patient_Outcomes_After_Early_Versus_Late.99557.pdf","pmid":"27922906","pubdate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Patient Outcomes After Early Versus Late Tracheostomy in the Puerto Rico Trauma Hospital","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journalpatientsafety\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Patient_Outcomes_After_Early_Versus_Late.99557.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7876706,"mean":6.669712343671,"rank":5693116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1902866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7876706,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251573,"mean":12.319843416596,"rank":163372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":75566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251573,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":411,"mean":14.316746341463,"rank":330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":411,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":18.407533333333,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JAVEGI\/statuses\/807809171789910016","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14648450],"posted_on":"2016-12-11T04:48:09+00:00","author":{"name":"EnfySegdelPaciente","url":"http:\/\/enfermeriayseguridaddelpaciente.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/539408136114028544\/L2-qmp--_normal.jpeg","description":"Enfermero.
