However, long-term prognosis and clinical outcome of patients experiencing PS or US as first clinical manifestation are unclear.\nClinical, MRI and cerebrospinal fluid data were obtained retrospectively and patients presenting with PS or US were compared to patients with CS presentation.\nIn a cohort of 532 relapsing onset MS patients followed for a mean period of 11.4 years (SD 3.6), 10 (1.9%) patients initially presented with PS\/US. PS\/US patients received disease modifying treatment (DMT) in a significantly smaller proportion immediately after the first clinical symptom (30% vs. 61.7%; p = 0.021) and during the observation period (60% vs. 83.5%; p = 0.033). In multivariate models correcting for sex, age at initial symptoms, complete remission of initial symptoms, total number of T2 and contrast-enhancing lesions, presence of oligoclonal bands and DMT exposure, PS\/US were not associated with lower annualized relapse rate or lower EDSS over time.\nIn addition to a similar conversion rate to CDMS, patients presenting with PS\/US at disease onset display very similar relapse and disability rates as patients with CS onset. Consequently, initial presentation with PS\/US does not indicate benign or atypical MS, but requires DMT initiation based on the same criteria as in CS patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Bsteh, Gabriel","Ehling, Rainer","Walchhofer, Lisa-Maria","Hegen, Harald","Auer, Michael","Wurth, Sebastian","Di Pauli, Franziska","Wagner, Michaela","Reindl, Markus","Deisenhammer, Florian","Berger, Thomas"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0181458","first_seen_on":"2017-07-28T13:36:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1501239245,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28749974?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28749974","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science (PLoS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Paroxysmal and unusual symptoms as first clinical manifestation of multiple sclerosis do not indicate benign prognosis\u2014The PaSiMS II study","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paroxysmal-unusual-symptoms-first-clinical-manifestation-multiple-sclerosis-not-indicate-benign-prog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":7165355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170477,"mean":11.555931908304,"rank":139271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170477,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114688,"mean":10.59611410186,"rank":96729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114688,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2750,"mean":9.367839941797,"rank":2141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2750,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
