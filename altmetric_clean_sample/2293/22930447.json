An. stephensi has three ecological variants; type, intermediate and mysorensis that can be differentiated on the basis of differences in number of ridges on egg float and on the basis of spiracular indices. Because of its anthropophilic nature the 'type' form is an efficient malaria vector. In the present study, the egg surface morphometry and morphology of An. stephensi 'type' form was studied and detail distinguish- ing characters were recorded for its correct identification.\nEggs of An. stephensi 'type' form were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after sputter- coating with gold. In total 23 egg characters were analysed morphologically and morphometrically, which included egg attributes, deck attributes, ventral tubercles, micropyle and float attributes.\nThe dorsal surface of the egg of 'type' form was curved while the ventral surface was concave and both anterior and posterior ends were blunt. The average length and width of egg was 473.94 + 11.18 and 154.69 + 2.66 \u03bcm respectively. The number of float ribs observed was 20.33 \u00b1 0.33. The maximum length of float was found to be 246.57 + 15.27 \u03bcm, whereas maximum width was 87.16 + 3.83 \u03bcm.\nThe present study has generated some important data which is specific to An. Stephensi 'type' form and provided significant morphological and morphometric standards for its correct identification. This information could be useful in differentiation of An. stephensi 'type' form from other ecological forms of the same species as well as other species of Anopheles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6ec3cf058f61000a00b","authors":["Tyagi, Varun","Dhiman, Sunil","Sharma, Ajay K","Srivastava, A R","Rabha, Bipul","Sukumaran, D","Veer, Vijay"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-28T13:13:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0972-9062"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Vector Borne Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1501236563,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28748836?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28748836","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Morphometric and morphological appraisal of the eggs of Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae) from India.","type":"article","volume":"54"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":7165350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170477,"mean":11.555953025646,"rank":139273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170477,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":1.1160714285714,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MalariaPapers\/statuses\/890876834988122112","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22930447],"posted_on":"2017-07-28T10:09:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Malaria Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/633328476070785024\/zGKHLt0g_normal.png","description":"I'm a bot tweeting papers about malaria as they appear on PubMed (& now preprints on BioRxiv). \n\nRun by @theosanderson.","id_on_source":"MalariaPapers","tweeter_id":"3428446343","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"890876834988122112"}]}}
