A conjugate of a calicheamicin hydrazide derivative attached via hydrazone formation to the oxidized carbohydrates of the anti-CD33 murine antibody P67.6 had been chosen for use in AML prior to humanization of this antibody. However, the CDR-grafted humanized P67.6 could not be used to make the carbohydrate conjugate because of the unexpected sensitivity of this antibody to periodate oxidation. Exploration of a series of bifunctional linkers resulted in a new class of calicheamicin conjugates, termed the hybrid conjugates, that allows for the attachment of the calicheamicin to lysines but incorporates the site of hydrolytic release, a hydrazone, previously shown to be required for activity. The optimized conjugate chosen for clinical trials, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (\"gem-ozo\", Mylotarg, formerly designated CMA-676), was significantly more potent and selective than the carbohydrate conjugate it replaced. It was selectively cytotoxic to HL-60 leukemia cells in tissue culture with an IC(50) in the low to sub-pg cal\/mL range (cal = calicheamicin equivalents). Doses of gem-ozo as low as 50 microg cal\/kg given three times to mice bearing HL-60 xenografts routinely resulted in long-term, tumor-free survivors, while a nonbinding control conjugate was relatively inactive. Gem-ozo at a concentration of 2 to 10 ng cal\/mL selectively inhibited leukemia colony formation by marrow cells from a significant proportion of AML patients. Gem-ozo has also shown significant activity against AML in Phase II trials and is the first antibody-targeted chemotherapeutic agent approved by the FDA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c4a","authors":["Hamann, Philip R","Hinman, Lois M","Hollander, Irwin","Beyer, Carl F","Lindh, Delores","Holcomb, Ryan","Hallett, William","Tsou, Hwei-Ru","Upeslacis, Janis","Shochat, Dan","Mountain, Andrew","Flowers, David A","Bernstein, Irwin"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-28T13:25:49+00:00","issns":["1043-1802"],"issue":"1","journal":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1503120660,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11792178"],"pmid":"11792178","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a potent and selective anti-CD33 antibody-calicheamicin conjugate for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gemtuzumab-ozogamicin-potent-selective-anticd33-antibody-calicheamicin-conjugate-treatment-acute-mye"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":2155036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5094811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216749,"mean":12.820499713953,"rank":71068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":143776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216749,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":830,"mean":2.4600048250905,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":634,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":830,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.26,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
