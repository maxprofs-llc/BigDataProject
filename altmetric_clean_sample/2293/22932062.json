We have shown previously that a soluble fusion protein, where the EphA4 ectodomain was fused to IgG Fc (EphA4 Fc), was an effective therapy in acute injuries and demonstrated that EphA4 Fc was a broad spectrum Eph\/ephrin antagonist. However, a very short in vivo half-life effectively limited its therapeutic development. We report a unique glycoengineering approach to enhance the half-life of EphA4 Fc. Progressive deletion of three demonstrated N-linked sites in EphA4 progressively increased in vivo half-life such that the triple mutant protein showed dramatically improved pharmacokinetic characteristics. Importantly, protein stability, affinity for ephrin ligands and antagonism of cell expressed EphA4 was fully preserved, enabling it to be developed as a broad spectrum Eph\/ephrin antagonist for use in both acute and chronic diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Pegg, Cassandra L.","Cooper, Leanne T.","Zhao, Jing","Gerometta, Michael","Smith, Fiona M.","Yeh, Michael","Bartlett, Perry F.","Gorman, Jeffrey J.","Boyd, Andrew W.","Cassandra L.
