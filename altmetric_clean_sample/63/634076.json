The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of PEA on the cutaneous allergic inflammatory reaction induced by different immunological and non-immunological stimuli in hypersensitive dogs. Six spontaneously Ascaris hypersensitive Beagle dogs were challenged with intradermal injections of Ascaris suum extract, substance P and anti-canine IgE, before and after a single oral administration of PEA at doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg\/kg. A significant reduction in wheal area induced by both antigen and anti-canine IgE challenge was observed after PEA administration. No significant differences were observed between the two higher doses studied, suggesting that the 10 mg\/kg dose had exerted the maximum inhibitory effect. When blood levels of PEA were compared with the effects at different times, an evident correlation was obtained. However, the anti-inflammatory effects of PEA were more long-lasting than their plasma concentrations. The intradermal injection of substance P did not reveal any skin reaction (wheal or erythema formation) at any of the concentrations tested. In conclusion, PEA might constitute a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of allergic inflammatory skin diseases in companion animals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fa","authors":["Santiago Cerrato","Pilar Brazis","Maria Federica della Valle","Alda Miolo","Stefania Petrosino","Vincenzo Di Marzo","Anna Puigdemont"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tvjl.2011.04.002","endpage":"382","first_seen_on":"2012-03-05T12:12:20+00:00","issns":["10900233"],"issue":"3","journal":"Veterinary Journal","last_mentioned_on":1330949052,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1090023311001407","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21601500"],"pmid":"21601500","pubdate":"2012-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"377","title":"Effects of palmitoylethanolamide on the cutaneous allergic inflammatory response in Ascaris hypersensitive Beagle dogs.","type":"article","volume":"191","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-palmitoylethanolamide-cutaneous-allergic-inflammatory-response-ascaris-hypersensitive-beagle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":951960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3527256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77298,"mean":4.3864292016507,"rank":14755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":61981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77298,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1044,"mean":2.2113691275168,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1044,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":1.0666666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
