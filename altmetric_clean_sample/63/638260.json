The researchers assessed the psychological functioning of the children using age appropriate Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) forms, and compared the scores of children with NP status with population-based data. The results indicate that in this rural sample, the prevalence of internalizing and externalizing disorders in children from NP homes was higher than in population-based norms. Specifically, the preschoolers showed a higher rate of depression, and the school-age children had higher rates of anxiety, depression, and atypical behaviors than their population-based peers. The results are interpreted in terms of low SES and accessibility to mental health services in rural communities. The authors suggest nurse practitioners include brief psychological screenings in their assessment protocols for this population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a0a","authors":["Comfort B Asanbe","Charlene Hall","Charles Bolden"],"doi":"10.1177\/1367493511420182","endpage":"25","first_seen_on":"2012-03-07T18:50:46+00:00","issns":["1741-2889","1367-4935"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Child Health Care","last_mentioned_on":1331145578,"links":["http:\/\/chc.sagepub.com\/content\/16\/1\/15.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/chc.sagepub.com\/content\/16\/1\/15.full.pdf","pmid":"22207001","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"15","subjects":["nursing","pediatrics"],"title":"Mental health disorders in children of non-drug-abusing parents A sample from a rural community devastated by methamphetamine","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mental-health-disorders-children-nondrugabusing-parents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9279282509359,"rank":2015559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":925259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73835,"mean":4.120246742693,"rank":31579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":27688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73835,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":2.8942091503268,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/CNTRochesterMI\/status\/177463536975482880","citation_ids":[638260],"posted_on":"2012-03-07T18:39:38+00:00","author":{"name":"College Nannies ","url":"http:\/\/www.collegenannies.com\/rochesterhillsmi","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1843618716\/Facebook_logo_new_normal.JPG","description":"The Rochester Hills Placement Center has been Building Stronger Families\u2122 in Rochester Hills and surrounding communities since 2010.","id_on_source":"CNTRochesterMI","tweeter_id":"101628348","geo":{"lt":42.664819,"ln":-83.160492,"country":"US"},"followers":215},"tweet_id":"177463536975482880"}]}}
