The drug acts by inhibiting the production of apoB-100, which is the structural core for all atherogenic lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The agent has been shown to produce significant reductions in LDL-C from baseline values compared with placebos. Clinical trials have demonstrated that mipomersen reduces LDL-C up to 44% in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and patients with significantly elevated LDL despite taking maximum doses of statins. Unlike other medications that target apoB-100, such as microsomal triglyceride transfer proteins, mipomersen does not cause hepatic steatosis or intestinal steatosis and does not affect dietary fat absorption. Adverse side effects encountered with mipomersen include flu-like symptoms, injection site reactions, and elevated liver transaminases. If future studies continue to show such promising results, mipomersen would likely be a viable additional lipid-lowering therapy for patients who are at high cardiovascular risk, intolerant to statins, and\/or not at target lipid levels despite maximum doses of statin therapy. Clinical outcome studies looking at cardiovascular disease end points still need to be done.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006de7","doi":"10.1097\/crd.0b013e31823424be","first_seen_on":"2012-03-06T20:43:45+00:00","issns":["1061-5377"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cardiology in Review","last_mentioned_on":1424176026,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cardiologyinreview\/Abstract\/2012\/03000\/Mipomersen___A_Safe_and_Effective_Antisense.6.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cardiologyinreview\/Fulltext\/2012\/03000\/Mipomersen___A_Safe_and_Effective_Antisense.6.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cardiologyinreview\/2012\/03000\/Mipomersen___A_Safe_and_Effective_Antisense.6.pdf","pmid":"22293857","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"90","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Mipomersen:  A Safe and Effective Antisense Therapy Adjunct to Statins in Patients With Hypercholesterolemia","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mipomersen-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770903,"mean":5.7215656817113,"rank":3380635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":776797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770903,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78006,"mean":4.6615259791039,"rank":48685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":13508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78006,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":357,"mean":1.3508651685393,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":357,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.0090909090909,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/CIRonlinejrl\/status\/181486244394573825","citation_ids":[636770],"posted_on":"2012-03-18T21:04:27+00:00","author":{"name":"CardiologyinReview","url":"http:\/\/cardiologyinreview.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611406050\/CardioinReview_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editors-in-Chief: Wlliam H.
