Once a tumor is established it may attain further characteristics via mutations or hypoxia, which stimulate new blood vessels. Angiogenesis is a hallmark in the pathogenesis of cancer and inflammatory diseases that may predispose to cancer. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) counteracts oxidative and inflammatory damage and was previously reported to play a key role in prostate carcinogenesis. To gain insight into the anti-tumoral properties of HO-1, we investigated its capability to modulate PCa associated-angiogenesis. In the present study, we identified in PC3 cells a set of inflammatory and pro-angiogenic genes down-regulated in response to HO-1 overexpression, in particular VEGFA, VEGFC, HIF1\u03b1 and \u03b15\u03b21 integrin. Our results indicated that HO-1 counteracts oxidative imbalance reducing ROS levels. An in vivo angiogenic assay showed that intradermal inoculation of PC3 cells stable transfected with HO-1 (PC3HO-1) generated tumours less vascularised than controls, with decreased microvessel density and reduced CD34 and MMP9 positive staining. Interestingly, longer term grown PC3HO-1 xenografts displayed reduced neovascularization with the subsequent down-regulation of VEGFR2 expression. Additionally, HO-1 repressed nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-mediated transcription from an NF-\u03baB responsive luciferase reporter construct, which strongly suggests that HO-1 may regulate angiogenesis through this pathway. Taken together, these data supports a key role of HO-1 as a modulator of the angiogenic switch in prostate carcinogenesis ascertaining it as a logical target for intervention therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069d1","authors":["Ferrando M","Gueron G","Elguero B","Giudice J","Salles A","Leskow FC","Jares-Erijman EA","Colombo L","Meiss R","Navone N","De Siervi A","Vazquez E","M.
