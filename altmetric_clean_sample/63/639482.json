Clinicians often consider the use of emergent therapies such as expedited radiation and\/or corticosteroids; however, there is a paucity of information describing the natural history of CNP in PM RMS. We sought to describe the clinical features of patients with PM RMS plus associated CNP and to evaluate the patient, disease, and treatment-related factors that impacted neurologic recovery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008482","authors":["Zorzi, Alexandra P.","Grant, Ronald","Gupta, Abha A.","Hodgson, David C.","Nathan, Paul C."],"doi":"10.1002\/pbc.24128","endpage":"1214","first_seen_on":"2012-03-08T12:11:58+00:00","issns":["1545-5017","1545-5009"],"issue":"7","journal":"Pediatric Blood and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1331207642,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/pbc.24128"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pbc.24128\/pdf","pmid":"22408065","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1211","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology","pediatrics"],"title":"Cranial nerve palsies in childhood parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cranial-nerve-palsies-childhood-parameningeal-rhabdomyosarcoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6386016,"mean":5.9827238460915,"rank":4719432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":948239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6386016,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82701,"mean":4.915231777509,"rank":52078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":15153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82701,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1293,"mean":2.1521965944272,"rank":719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1293,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.86666666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
