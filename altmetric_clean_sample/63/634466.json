Here we describe the modification of this assay to measure interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12\/IL-23 p40 (IL-12\/23) in domestic cat plasma, report values obtained from plasma collected after feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) exposure, and compare plasma concentrations to blood cell mRNA expression. The validated quantitation limits of this assay are 31-1000 pg\/ml for IFN\u03b3, 63-2000 pg\/ml for IL-10, and 20-625 pg\/ml for IL-12\/23. Plasma cytokine levels from domestic cats infected with pathogenic and\/or apathogenic FIV were determined at 3-4 and 7-8 weeks post-infection. IL-12\/23 was elevated (p<0.05) during acute infection with both FIV strains in two similar studies, conducted five years apart in different feline cohorts (n=44 total animals). IL-12\/23 concentrations ranged from 377 to 1904 pg\/ml in na\u00efve cats and 552 to 3460 pg\/ml in infected cats. In contrast, the majority of plasma samples had IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 concentrations below the lowest standard tested. The inability to consistently detect levels of IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 in plasma, despite the fact that mRNA changes were detected, suggests that these cytokines may be secreted and\/or cleared in a more highly regulated manner than IL-12\/23, or perhaps exert local effects under tighter peripheral constraints and\/or at a lower effective concentration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f9","authors":["Britta A.
