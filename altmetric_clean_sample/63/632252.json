An equino-varus deformity of the foot is the commonest deformity seen. In this report we present a 53 years old lady who had poliomyelitis as a child and presented with a painful, degenerate ankle and 12 degrees of varus deformity. CT confirmed advanced degenerative changes. The management options included realignment and fusion, supramalleolar ostoetomy or total ankle replacement. In view of the satisfactory active range of motion and advanced OA confirmed by CT scan we considered the option of total ankle replacement. To our knowledge this has never been reported before. At two and half years follow up the patient showed satisfactory functional results (AOFAS score 88\/100) and high satisfaction. Plain radiographs revealed a well aligned joint with no evidence of loosening or osteolysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028fd","authors":["Harris, N.J."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fas.2009.11.001","first_seen_on":"2012-03-03T16:29:48+00:00","issns":["1268-7731"],"journal":"Foot & Ankle Surgery (Elsevier Science)","last_mentioned_on":1330791947,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1268773109001350"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.footanklesurgery-journal.com\/article\/S1268-7731(09)00135-0\/pdf","pmid":"22326009","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Is there a role for total ankle replacement in polio patients?: A case report and review of the literature","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-total-ankle-replacement-polio-patients-case-report-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":988462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77513,"mean":4.3477475229641,"rank":48040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":18236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77513,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":1.5292553191489,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/postpolionews\/status\/175980300239781888","citation_ids":[632252],"posted_on":"2012-03-03T16:25:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Post-Polio News","url":"https:\/\/www.post-polio.org.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000571299619\/4fad51378685b137344ccbd5b7c9aee3_normal.png","description":"Incorporating NewsBites (Est. 1997) & Polio and Post-Polio News (Est. 2004).
