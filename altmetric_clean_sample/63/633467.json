This was in agreement with the pioneering work of Jaques Benveniste suggesting that the electronic transmission of the 4-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) signals could be transferred to target neutrophils by an oscillator when coupled to two electromagnetic coils demonstrating the same biologic activity and so mimicking the biologic function of the original chemical active molecule. The present work is the further development of recent research designed to verify the hypotheses that water could record and replay the EMIT from biologic active chemical molecules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c79","authors":[" Alberto   Foletti "],"doi":"10.1089\/acm.2011.0104","first_seen_on":"2012-03-04T21:43:26+00:00","issns":["1075-5535"],"journal":"Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1330896706,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/acm.2011.0104"],"pmid":"22385079","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Experimental Finding on the Electromagnetic Information Transfer of Specific Molecular Signals Mediated Through the Aqueous System on Two Human Cellular Models","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/experimental-finding-electromagnetic-information-transfer-specific-molecular-signals-mediated-throug"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":2743820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":727083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74600,"mean":4.0726984544028,"rank":48123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":21002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74600,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1149,"mean":5.4959773519164,"rank":850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1149,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.9432432432432,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
