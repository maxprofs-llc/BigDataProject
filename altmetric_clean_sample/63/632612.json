This is impractical for intensive care unit patients under ventilation or for pediatric populations under the age of 3 to 4 years. To address this problem, we propose a free-breathing protocol for hyperpolarized He lung ventilation spiral imaging. This approach was evaluated in vitro and on rabbits.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a7a","doi":"10.1097\/rli.0b013e3181965d52","first_seen_on":"2012-03-03T23:13:06+00:00","issns":["0020-9996"],"issue":"4","journal":"Investigative Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1330815710,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/Abstract\/2009\/04000\/Free_Breathing_Hyperpolarized_3He_Lung_Ventilation.1.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/2009\/04000\/Free_Breathing_Hyperpolarized_3He_Lung_Ventilation.1.pdf","pmid":"19252441","pubdate":"2009-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"185","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Free Breathing Hyperpolarized 3He Lung Ventilation Spiral MR Imaging","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/free-breathing-hyperpolarized-he3-lung-ventilation-spiral-mr-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3109102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":997775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77513,"mean":4.3463554804417,"rank":48409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":19334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77513,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":805,"mean":1.3157064676617,"rank":568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":805,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.93181818181818,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
