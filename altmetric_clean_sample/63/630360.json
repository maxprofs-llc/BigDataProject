However, its prevalence and consequences are underestimated. Malnutrition is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality, generating high hospital overcosts. It is important to examine four separate issues requiring the use of different methods for their assessment, namely the nutritional risk, the severity of malnutrition, the risk of associated complications, and the efficacy of renutrition programs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d105","authors":["Cynober L"],"first_seen_on":"2012-03-02T11:38:39+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Bulletin de l Acad\u00e9mie nationale de m\u00e9decine","last_mentioned_on":1330688189,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22292311?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22292311","pubdate":"2012-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Nutritional support at the hospital: diagnosis of malnutrition and its associated risks for better prevention and treatment].","type":"article","volume":"195","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutritional-support-hospital-diagnosis-malnutrition-associated-risks-better-prevention-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3913240,"mean":5.0137767509056,"rank":3129410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":88757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3913240,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75808,"mean":4.0843783990605,"rank":54272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75808,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":1.8796842105263,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.45,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"IR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/libroazuln\/status\/175545106126999552","citation_ids":[630360],"posted_on":"2012-03-02T11:36:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":161},"tweet_id":"175545106126999552"}]}}
