Rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes during the neonatal period by the fifth day of age develop the classic diabetic picture of hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, polyuria, and polydipsia aggravated by insulin resistance in adulthood. In this study, we investigated whether the effect of long-term treatment with melatonin can improve insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders in these animals. At the fourth week of age, diabetic animals started an 8-wk treatment with melatonin (1 mg\/kg body weight) in the drinking water at night. Animals were then killing, and the sc, epididymal (EP), and retroperitoneal (RP) fat pads were excised, weighed, and processed for adipocyte isolation for morphometric analysis as well as for measuring glucose uptake, oxidation, and incorporation of glucose into lipids. Blood samples were collected for biochemical assays. Melatonin treatment reduced hyperglycemia, polydipsia, and polyphagia as well as improved insulin resistance as demonstrated by constant glucose disappearance rate and homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance. However, melatonin treatment was unable to recover body weight deficiency, fat mass, and adipocyte size of diabetic animals. Adiponectin and fructosamine levels were completely recovered by melatonin, whereas neither plasma insulin level nor insulin secretion capacity was improved in diabetic animals. Furthermore, melatonin caused a marked delay in the sexual development, leaving genital structures smaller than those of nontreated diabetic animals. Melatonin treatment improved the responsiveness of adipocytes to insulin in diabetic animals measured by tests of glucose uptake (sc, EP, and RP), glucose oxidation, and incorporation of glucose into lipids (EP and RP), an effect that seems partially related to an increased expression of insulin receptor substrate 1, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. In conclusion, melatonin treatment was capable of ameliorating the metabolic abnormalities in this particular diabetes model, including insulin resistance and promoting a better long-term glycemic control.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f610007282","doi":"10.1210\/en.2011-1675","first_seen_on":"2012-03-06T08:38:04+00:00","issns":["1945-7170"],"journal":"Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1331022960,"links":["http:\/\/endo.endojournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/02\/22\/en.2011-1675"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/endo.endojournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/02\/22\/en.2011-1675.full.pdf","pmid":"22374967","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Metabolic Disorders and Adipose Tissue Insulin Responsiveness in Neonatally STZ-Induced Diabetic Rats Are Improved by Long-Term Melatonin Treatment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-disorders-adipose-tissue-insulin-responsiveness-neonatally-stzinduced-diabetic-rats-improv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508238,"mean":5.1674528195662,"rank":3029080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":924753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508238,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76970,"mean":4.5134027725447,"rank":47092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":14698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76970,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2221,"mean":2.9490720720721,"rank":1536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2221,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.7027826086957,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
