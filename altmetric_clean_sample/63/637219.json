For over 2.5 years, it has been used in traffic medicine among subjects applying for driver's license renewal or regranting in Belgium. We report on data collected during the program and provide an estimation of an applicable cut-off point in forensic situations. Using this cut-off, the success of the driver's license regranting program is evaluated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021c6","authors":["Maenhout TM","Baten G","De Buyzere ML","Delanghe JR","Maenhout, Thomas M.","Baten, Guido","De Buyzere, Marc L.","Delanghe, Joris R."],"doi":"10.1093\/alcalc\/ags013","endpage":"260","first_seen_on":"2012-03-07T02:28:28+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-3162903","handles":["1854\/LU-3162903"],"issns":["1464-3502","0735-0414"],"issue":"3","journal":"Alcohol & Alcoholism","last_mentioned_on":1331734533,"links":["http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/03\/05\/alcalc.ags013.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/03\/05\/alcalc.ags013.abstract?papetoc","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/alcalc\/ags013"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/03\/05\/alcalc.ags013.full.pdf","pmid":"22395230","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"253","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin in a Driver's License Regranting Program","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbohydrate-deficient-transferrin-drivers-license-regranting-program"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1989429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2421902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76767,"mean":4.4194050751634,"rank":25820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":48523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76767,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":781,"mean":5.1094230769231,"rank":408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":781,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.8083333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
