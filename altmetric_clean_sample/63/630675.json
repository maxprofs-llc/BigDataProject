Their propensity to differentiate into cell types of connective tissue, such as osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, suggests that MSC may function as a reserve of progenitor cells that repair and maintain healthy adult tissues. Dysfunction of the trabecular meshwork (TM), a connective tissue at the anterior region of the human eye that regulates intraocular pressure, plays a major role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. The mechanobiology and pharmacological aspects of the TM tissue have been relatively well studied in disease states. Less well understood is if there are progenitor cells within the TM that contribute to maintenance of this tissue. In this study, we have identified and characterized an expandable population of cells that have stem cell-like properties. In particular, these cells express the markers CD73, CD90, and CD105, which are typically associated with MSC. Thus, we have named these cells TM-MSC. As further evidence that these cells are MSC, they were differentiated in vitro into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes. Through genomic characterization, we show that TM-MSC have gene expression patterns most similar to MSC derived from other tissues. TM-MSC express genes found on adult TM tissue, suggesting that TM-MSC are progenitor cells that serve to maintain a healthy TM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035be","doi":"10.1089\/scd.2011.0655","first_seen_on":"2012-03-02T14:16:11+00:00","issns":["1557-8534"],"journal":"Stem Cells & Development","last_mentioned_on":1330696727,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22364584"],"pmid":"22364584","pubdate":"2012-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","hematology"],"title":"Identification and Characterization of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived from the Trabecular Meshwork of the Human Eye.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-characterization-mesenchymal-stem-cells-derived-trabecular-meshwork-human-eye"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3913240,"mean":5.0137767509056,"rank":2175690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1006096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3913240,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75808,"mean":4.0843619067723,"rank":32383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":29029,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75808,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":543,"mean":4.6064132841328,"rank":261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":543,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.1857142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
