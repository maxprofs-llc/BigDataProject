Lifestyle modification is a key strategy for the prevention and treatment of HTN. Stress has been associated with greater cardiovascular risk, and stress management is a recommended intervention for hypertensives. Stress reduction through relaxation therapies has been shown to have an effect on human physiology, including lowering blood pressure (BP). However, individualised behavioural interventions are resource intensive, and group stress management approaches have not been validated for reducing HTN. The HARMONY Study is a pilot randomised controlled trial designed to determine if mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a standardised group therapy, is an effective intervention for lowering BP in stage 1 unmedicated hypertensives.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Kimberly Blom","Maxine How","Monica Dai","Brian Baker","Jane Irvine","Susan Abbey","Beth L Abramson","Martin Myers","Nancy Perkins","Sheldon W Tobe"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2012-000848","first_seen_on":"2012-03-06T17:11:48+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"2","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1333816179,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/2\/2\/e000848.short","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22396225?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3298834\/?tool=pubmed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/2\/2\/e000848.full.pdf","pmid":"22396225","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","title":"Hypertension Analysis of stress Reduction using Mindfulness meditatiON and Yoga (The HARMONY Study): study protocol of a randomised control trial.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypertension-analysis-stress-reduction-using-mindfulness-meditation-yoga-harmony-study-study-protoco-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7264069,"mean":6.364767530532,"rank":2965812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4193857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7264069,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90956,"mean":4.9837298004508,"rank":29665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":59385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90956,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4996,"mean":16.633947547548,"rank":3004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4996,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":18.8955,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":14,"Student  > Ph.
