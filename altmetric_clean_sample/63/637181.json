In this way, medical care depends on accurately identifying the severity of injury-related forces. Clinically, injury severity is determined by a combination of the Glasgow Coma Scale, length of unconsciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, and persistence of neurological sequelae. In the laboratory, injury severity is gauged by the biomechanical forces and the acute suppression of neurological reflexes. The present communication describes and validates the \"fencing response\" as an overt indicator of injury force magnitude and midbrain localization to aid in injury identification and classification.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5033cf058f61000309f","authors":["Hosseini AH","Lifshitz J","ARIO H.
