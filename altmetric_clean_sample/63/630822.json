No history of similar lesions in the family of the patient was obtained. Radiographic examination revealed a well-circumscribed lobular radio-opaque mass surrounded by a radiolucent margin. The macroscopic specimen showed lobular mineralized masses with a \u2033ginger root\u2033-like appearance. Microscopic examination showed a lobular calcified mass with a peripheral zone of fibropsammomatous tissue corresponding with the radiolucent margin. The differential diagnoses, which include osteoma, ossifying fibroma and cementoblastoma, are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f35","doi":"10.1259\/dmfr\/13435626","first_seen_on":"2012-03-02T15:23:07+00:00","issns":["0250-832X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Dentomaxillofacial Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1416404736,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22378756?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3520290\/"],"pmid":"22378756","pubdate":"2012-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","dentistry"],"title":"Gigantiform cementoma in a child","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gigantiform-cementoma-child"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4527185,"mean":5.2867864119486,"rank":1687053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2807129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4527185,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77656,"mean":4.4991254651986,"rank":20103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":56822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77656,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316,"mean":1.1260317460317,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.96333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
