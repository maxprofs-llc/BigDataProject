In the search for novel IAP-interacting proteins we identified the neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE homologue (NRAGE) as being able to bind to the avian IAP homologue ITA. This interaction requires the RING domain of ITA. NRAGE additionally coimmunoprecipitates with XIAP. When overexpressed in 32D cells NRAGE augments interleukin-3 withdrawal induced apoptosis, possibly through binding endogenous XIAP. Moreover, NRAGE is able to overcome the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Bruce W. M.
