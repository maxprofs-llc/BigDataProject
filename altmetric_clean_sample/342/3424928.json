Deletion of the SH3 region from the protein encoded by the c-abl proto-oncogene activates the protein's transforming capacity, thereby suggesting the participation of the SH3 region in the negative regulation of transformation. A complementary DNA was isolated that encoded a protein, 3BP-1, to which the SH3 region of Abl bound with high specificity and to which SH3 regions from other proteins bound differentially. The sequence of the 3BP-1 protein is similar to that of a COOH-terminal segment of Bcr and to guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP)-rho, which suggests that it might have GAP activity for Ras-related proteins. The 3BP-1 protein may therefore be a mediator of SH3 function in transformation inhibition and may link tyrosine kinases to Ras-related proteins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1992Sci...257..803C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["P Cicchetti","BJ Mayer","G Thiel","D Baltimore"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1379745","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T05:02:53+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1095-9203","0036-8075"],"issue":"5071","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1199581957,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.1379745","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1379745"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/257\/5071\/803.full.pdf","pmid":"1379745","pubdate":"1992-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Identification of a protein that binds to the SH3 region of Abl and is similar to Bcr and GAP-rho.","type":"article","volume":"257","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-protein-binds-sh3-region-abl-similar-bcr-gaprho"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":815874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94622,"mean":8.1466202428639,"rank":24557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94622,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27897,"mean":20.957488457127,"rank":15017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":7329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27897,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":495,"mean":91.51312145749,"rank":430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":495,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
