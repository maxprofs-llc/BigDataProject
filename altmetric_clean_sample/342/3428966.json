The long-term application of TWW increased CaCO3, P, N, K, TOC, metal contents, pH and salinity in isohumic soil in semi-arid and arid climates. Also, it was found that using freshwater after TWW within the same land leached soil compounds and pollutants. Consequently, a clear decline of salinity, pH, macronutrient and pollutant concentrations occured. Therefore, the economic profitability in topsoil decreased. TWW contributed to crop production increase, despite high fertilizer and metal concentrations in TWW and soil. Also, no toxic metal trace was detected in cultivated plants despite soil pollution. Occasional rainwater removed the stable part of fertilizers in topsoil and slightly improved plant development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649f","authors":["Rim Azouzi","Abdelkrim Charef","Lamia Ayed"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00128-015-1487-7","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T07:36:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0800"],"journal":"Bulletin of Environmental Contamination & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1431395579,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00128-015-1487-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00128-015-1487-7.pdf","pmid":"25661007","pubdate":"2015-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Water Quality and Toxic Element Effects on Isohumic Soil Properties and Crops in Semi-arid Regions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/water-quality-toxic-element-effects-isohumic-soil-properties-crops-semiarid-regions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5090406,"mean":6.0304841555845,"rank":2071155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2993280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5090406,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181321,"mean":8.6767137877787,"rank":66277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":113695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181321,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":636,"mean":1.5680692913386,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":636,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":0.88906666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
