The prototype which integrates quantitative and qualitative computational methodologies can be used to predict blood glucose profiles and adjust insulin doses in insulin-dependent (type I) diabetic subjects. A feedback loop insulin-dosage optimisation procedure which allows quantitative advice to be generated is also described. Possible clinical applications for the system, which is intended for educational use and clinically as a research tool to try and attain normoglycaemia, are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002322","doi":"10.1016\/0933-3657(94)90042-6","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T03:02:53+00:00","issns":["0933-3657"],"journal":"Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1308354627,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/0933-3657(94)90042-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8049754"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.aiimjournal.com\/article\/0933365794900426\/pdf","pmid":"8049754","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Combining rule-based reasoning and mathematical modelling in diabetes care.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combining-rulebased-reasoning-mathematical-modelling-diabetes-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":817054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93922,"mean":8.0764459066664,"rank":24249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93922,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":2.1983298969072,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
