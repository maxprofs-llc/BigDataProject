The victim failed to seek medical care following the bite of an eastern coral snake (Micrurus fulvius) and succumbed within hours. Post-mortem proof of envenomation was obtained using an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) developed specifically for this investigation. U.S. coral snakes are briefly reviewed in terms of their venom compositions, their clinical effects, and proper pre-hospital and hospital management. The clinical significance of the impending absence of commercially available antivenom for coral snake bites in the U.S. is highlighted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367e","authors":["Norris RL","Pfalzgraf RR","Laing G"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T03:37:22+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0041-0101"],"issue":"6","journal":"Toxicon","last_mentioned_on":1256354335,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19673084"],"pmid":"19673084","pubdate":"2009-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Death following coral snake bite in the United States--first documented case (with ELISA confirmation of envenomation) in over 40 years.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/death-following-coral-snake-bite-united-states-first-documented-case-elisa-confirmation-envenomation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636227,"mean":4.9205935445202,"rank":816776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636227,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95033,"mean":8.1723319513428,"rank":24760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95033,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":759,"mean":2.9182664907652,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":759,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.7375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
