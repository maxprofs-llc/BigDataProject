Participants: College students (N = 57) enrolled at a state-funded institution who had a current prescription for an antidepressant and regularly used a smartphone device. Methods: Participants were randomized to either a reminder group or a control group. Both groups were asked to complete a survey and undergo a manual pill count at the beginning of the study and 30\u00a0days later. Results: There was a strong trend suggesting that the use of a medication reminder app was beneficial for adherence to antidepressant medication regimens. Factors influencing medication adherence in college students included health beliefs, use of illicit drugs, and type of professional care received. Conclusions: Use of a medication reminder may increase adherence to antidepressant medications in college students.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f610001611","authors":["Tracy Hammonds","Hammonds T","Rickert K","Goldstein C","Gathright E","Gilmore S","Derflinger B","Bennett B","Sterns A","Drew BL","Hughes JW"],"doi":"10.1080\/07448481.2014.975716","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T06:44:31+00:00","issns":["0744-8481","1940-3208"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of American College Health","last_mentioned_on":1423276273,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07448481.2014.975716","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07448481.2014.975716?ai=2qs&mi=ddgbhb&af=R"],"pmid":"25338175","pubdate":"2014-10-23T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Adherence to Antidepressant Medications: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Medication Reminding in College Students.","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adherence-antidepressant-medications-randomized-controlled-trial-medication-reminding-college-studen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4724476,"mean":5.6951346649109,"rank":3956495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4724476,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165266,"mean":8.7923092003755,"rank":133178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165266,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293,"mean":4.5471849315068,"rank":262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.955,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
