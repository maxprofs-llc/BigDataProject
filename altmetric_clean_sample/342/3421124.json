BLyS and APRIL share two receptors, TACI and BCMA, whereas a third receptor, BAFF-R, specifically binds BLyS. Both BLyS and APRIL have been described as homotrimeric molecules, a feature common to members of the TNF superfamily. In this study, we show that APRIL and BLyS can form active heterotrimeric molecules when coexpressed and that circulating heterotrimers are present in serum samples from patients with systemic immune-based rheumatic diseases. These findings raise the possibility that active BLyS\/APRIL heterotrimers may play a role in rheumatic and other autoimmune diseases and that other members of the TNF ligand superfamily may also form active soluble heterotrimers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Viktor Roschke","Svetlana Sosnovtseva","Christopher D.
