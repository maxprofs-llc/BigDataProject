Quantitative measures of tissue spatial features are generally not captured. To gain additional mechanistic and prognostic insights, a need for quantitative architectural analysis arises in studying immune cell-cancer interactions within the tumor microenvironment and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs).","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010PLoSO...512420S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["A.
