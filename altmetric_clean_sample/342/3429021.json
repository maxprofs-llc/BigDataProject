An isolate of B. burgdorferi from an erythema migrans lesion was cultivated in BSK II medium and exposed to increasing concentrations (0.0625 mg\/l-2 mg\/l) of penicillin G for 5 days. The in vitro minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined to be 0.5 mg\/l by broth dilution method. The morphological structures of untreated spirochetes, as well as their characteristic ultrastructural changes when exposed to penicillin, were observed by electron microscopy. The following alterations were discovered: (i) Numerous outer sheath blebs at a penicillin concentration of 0.0625 mg\/l. (ii) A characteristic irregular waveform of the borrelial cells and complete loss of the outer sheath at a penicillin concentration of 0.125 mg\/l. (iii) The presence of \"spheroplasts\" at the same concentration. (iv) Structural changes of the protoplasmic cylinder complex which showed an irregular pattern at a penicillin concentration of 0.125 mg\/l. (v) Disruption of the protoplasmic cylinder complex into several parts at penicillin concentrations of 0.25 mg\/l and 0.5 mg\/l. (vi) Severe cytolysis at penicillin concentrations of 1 mg\/l and 2 mg\/l.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000597d","authors":["M Schaller","U Neubert"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T07:38:41+00:00","issns":["0300-8126"],"issue":"6","journal":"Infection","last_mentioned_on":1187922828,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7698837"],"pmid":"7698837","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Ultrastructure of Borrelia burgdorferi after exposure to benzylpenicillin.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrastructure-borrelia-burgdorferi-after-exposure-benzylpenicillin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":816258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94124,"mean":8.1010293127081,"rank":24332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94124,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266,"mean":2.038558490566,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.1809230769231,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
