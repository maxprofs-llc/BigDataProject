Currently being investigated, active and passive Abeta-immunotherapy significantly reduce Abeta plaque deposition, neuritic dystrophy, and astrogliosis in the brains of APP transgenic (APP\/Tg) mice. Immunization with Abeta42 formulated in the Th1-type adjuvant QS21 was beneficial for AD patients with significant titers of anti-Abeta antibodies, however, 6% of participants developed meningoencephalitis, likely due to anti-Abeta-specific autoimmune Th1 cells. Thus, successful Abeta vaccination requires the development of strong antibody responses without Th1-type cellular immunity. In this study, we compared the induction of humoral immune responses with Th1-type (Quil A) and Th2-type (Alum) adjuvants singly and in combination, using our novel epitope vaccine composed of self B cell epitope Abeta(1-15) and foreign T cell epitope PADRE (PADRE-Abeta(1-15)-MAP). Formulated in Quil A, this vaccine resulted in significantly higher anti-Abeta antibody responses in both BALB\/c (H-2d) and C57BL\/6 (H-2b) mice, compared with Alum. Anti-Abeta antibodies induced by Alum were predominantly IgG1 type accompanied by lower levels of IgG2a and IgG2b. Quil A induced robust and almost equal titers of anti-Abeta antibodies of IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes and slightly lower levels of IgG2b. Switching adjuvants from Alum to Quil A induced higher concentrations of antibodies than injections with Alum only, however slightly lower than Quil A only. Switching both adjuvants did not change the profile of antibody responses generated by the initial adjuvant injected. These results suggest that switching from Alum to Quil A would be beneficial for AD patients because anti-Abeta antibody production was enhanced without changing the initially generated and likely beneficial Th2-type humoral response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2005.11.039","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T05:57:10+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1174448648,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.vaccine.2005.11.039","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16368167","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2081151"],"pmcid":"PMC2081151","pmid":"16368167","pubdate":"2005-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Prototype Alzheimer\u2019s disease epitope vaccine induced strong Th2-type anti-A\u03b2 antibody response with Alum to Quil A adjuvant switch","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prototype-alzheimers-disease-epitope-vaccine-induced-strong-th2type-antia-antibody-response-alum-qui"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620974,"mean":4.9299989306774,"rank":815951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2281363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620974,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92583,"mean":7.1929209997624,"rank":23407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92583,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2421,"mean":4.8483479338843,"rank":561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2421,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":3.146,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
