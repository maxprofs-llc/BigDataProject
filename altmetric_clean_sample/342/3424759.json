The premise for this study is the increasing awareness that various PM components induce pulmonary inflammation through the generation of oxidative stress. Coarse, fine, and ultrafine particles (UFPs) were collected by ambient particle concentrators in the Los Angeles basin in California and used to study their chemical composition in parallel with assays for generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ability to induce oxidative stress in macrophages and epithelial cells. UFPs were most potent toward inducing cellular heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and depleting intracellular glutathione. HO-1 expression, a sensitive marker for oxidative stress, is directly correlated with the high organic carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content of UFPs. The dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, a quantitative measure of in vitro ROS formation, was correlated with PAH content and HO-1 expression. UFPs also had the highest ROS activity in the DTT assay. Because the small size of UFPs allows better tissue penetration, we used electron microscopy to study subcellular localization. UFPs and, to a lesser extent, fine particles, localize in mitochondria, where they induce major structural damage. This may contribute to oxidative stress. Our studies demonstrate that the increased biological potency of UFPs is related to the content of redox cycling organic chemicals and their ability to damage mitochondria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e9","authors":["Ning Li","Constantinos Sioutas","Arthur Cho","Debra Schmitz","Chandan Misra","Joan Sempf","Meiying Wang","Terry Oberley","John Froines","Andre Nel","Li, Ning","Sioutas, Constantinos","Cho, Arthur","Schmitz, Debra","Misra, Chandan","Sempf, Joan","Wang, Meiying","Oberley, Terry","Froines, John","Nel, Andre"],"doi":"10.1289\/ehp.6000","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T04:53:32+00:00","issns":["0091-6765"],"issue":"4","journal":"Environmental Health Perspectives","last_mentioned_on":1495989000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12676598","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1241427","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1241427\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1241427\/pdf\/ehp0111-000455.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1241427","pmid":"12676598","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Institute of Environmental Health Science","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"455","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Ultrafine particulate pollutants induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1241427\/","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrafine-particulate-pollutants-induce-oxidative-stress-mitochondrial-damage-9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.298,"score_history":{"1y":5.048,"6m":5.048,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.298},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":496460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7786464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240846,"mean":8.3333473977039,"rank":18785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":222061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240846,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5901,"mean":10.201148135593,"rank":559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":5342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5901,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":18.081608695652,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":39,"Student  > Doctoral Student":16,"Student  > Ph.
