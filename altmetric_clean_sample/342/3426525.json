Current genetic examination of two patients with near complete FI deficiency and three patients with no detectable serum FI and also close family members revealed homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in several domains of FI. These mutations were introduced into recombinant FI and the resulting proteins were purified for functional studies, while transient transfection was used to analyze expression and secretion. The G170V mutation resulted in a protein that was not expressed, whereas the mutations Q232K, C237Y, S250L, I339M and H400L affected secretion. Furthermore, the C237Y and the S250L mutants did not degrade C4b and C3b as efficiently as the WT. The truncated Q336x mutant could be expressed, in vitro, but was not functional because it lacks the serine protease domain. Furthermore, this truncated FI was not detected in serum of the patient. Structural investigations using molecular modeling were performed to predict the potential impact the mutations have on FI structure. This is the first study that investigates, at the functional level, the consequences of molecular defects identified in patients with full FI deficiency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007351","authors":["Nilsson, Sara C.","Trouw, Leendert A.","Renault, Nicolas","Miteva, Maria A.","Genel, Ferah","Zelazko, Marta","Marquart, Hanne","Muller, Klaus","Sj\u00f6holm, Anders G.","Truedsson, Lennart","Villoutreix, Bruno O.","Blom, Anna M."],"doi":"10.1002\/eji.200838702","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T06:08:32+00:00","issns":["1521-4141"],"journal":"European Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1287570918,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/eji.200838702","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19065647"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/eji.200838702\/pdf","pmid":"19065647","pubdate":"2008-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Genetic, molecular and functional analyses of complement factor I deficiency.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-molecular-functional-analyses-complement-factor-i-deficiency-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":816320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94097,"mean":8.1006224919233,"rank":24317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94097,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1182,"mean":1.8565537679932,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1182,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.7074074074074,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
