High density of NOP receptor has been found in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), the main output pathway involved in descending pain-control system. The aim of our work was to evaluate the involvement of the N\/OFQ\/NOP system in the modulation of MOP analgesia in the rat vlPAG using UFP-101, a selective NOP antagonist. N\/OFQ significantly blocked DAMGO (a selective MOP agonist) analgesia, while UFP-101 enhanced the effect of the opioid given at a subanalgesic dose. These results confirm our hypothesis of an antiopioid role for N\/OFQ in the vlPAG.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032be","doi":"10.1016\/j.peptides.2007.05.013","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T05:46:32+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Peptides","last_mentioned_on":1268971076,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.peptides.2007.05.013","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17628212"],"pmid":"17628212","pubdate":"2007-07-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Blockade of the nociceptin\/orphanin FQ\/NOP receptor system in the rat ventrolateral periaqueductal gray potentiates DAMGO analgesia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blockade-nociceptinorphanin-fqnop-receptor-system-rat-ventrolateral-periaqueductal-gray-potentiates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":816274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94118,"mean":8.1007893791772,"rank":24328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94118,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":519,"mean":2.3120154440154,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":519,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.9842105263158,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
