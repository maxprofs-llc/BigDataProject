One such potential variable risk factor is anxiety sensitivity (AS), or a fear of anxiety related sensations. Studies have established elevated AS in women compared to men, and that AS prospectively predicts the development of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Additionally, research has demonstrated some specificity with regard to the lower-order AS dimensions (physical, cognitive, and social concerns) in relation to symptoms of anxiety and depression. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether overall AS, as well as lower-order AS dimensions, statistically mediate the relations between gender and anxiety and depressive symptoms in a sample of individuals with elevated AS presenting for an AS intervention. Data for the current study were collected from participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0106) at baseline prior to randomization to treatment condition. Results revealed that overall AS statistically mediated the relations between gender and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Significant statistical mediation was also found for AS physical and social concerns for anxiety symptoms, and AS cognitive concerns for depressive symptoms. These results suggest the possible importance of AS in the gender discrepancies in anxiety and depression. Future research should examine whether an AS intervention can help ameliorate this prevalence gap.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ee6","authors":["Norr AM","Albanese BJ","Allan NP","Schmidt NB"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpsychires.2015.01.014","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T06:08:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-3956"],"journal":"Journal of Psychiatric Research","last_mentioned_on":1423270648,"links":["http:\/\/www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com\/article\/S0022-3956(15)00027-8\/abstract?rss=yes","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com%2Farticle%2FS0022-3956%2815%2900027-8%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=piat-site&fb_ref=Default&fb_source=message","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http:\/\/www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com\/article\/S0022-3956(15)00027-8\/abstract?rss=yes&code=piat-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journalofpsychiatricresearch.com\/article\/S0022395615000278\/pdf","pmid":"25687739","pubdate":"2015-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Anxiety sensitivity as a mechanism for gender discrepancies in anxiety and mood symptoms","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anxiety-sensitivity-mechanism-gender-discrepancies-anxiety-mood-symptoms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4724476,"mean":5.6951346649109,"rank":3349840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":767879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4724476,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165265,"mean":8.7923578637819,"rank":115379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":32088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165265,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1018,"mean":5.6123225172075,"rank":808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1018,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":13.961135135135,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
