JNJ-7925476 (trans-6-(4-ethynylphenyl)-1,2,3,5,6,10b-hexahydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline) is a selective and potent inhibitor of the SERT, NET, and DAT (K(i)=0.9, 17 and 5.2 nM, respectively). Following subcutaneous dosing in rat, JNJ-7925476 was rapidly absorbed into the plasma, and drug concentrations in the brain tracked with those in the plasma but were 7-fold higher. The ED(50) values for JNJ-7925476 occupancy of the SERT, NET, and DAT in rat brain were 0.18, 0.09 and 2.4 mg\/kg, respectively. JNJ-7925476 (0.1-10 mg\/kg, s.c.) rapidly induced a robust, dose-dependent increase in extracellular serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine levels in rat cerebral cortex. The compound also showed potent antidepressant-like activity in the mouse tail suspension test (ED(50)=0.3 mg\/kg, i.p.). These results demonstrate that JNJ-7925476 is a triple reuptake inhibitor with in-vivo efficacy in biochemical and behavioral models of depression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284e","doi":"10.1016\/j.ejphar.2008.04.008","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T06:18:34+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1338863037,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ejphar.2008.04.008","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18499098"],"pmid":"18499098","pubdate":"2008-10-05T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"In-vitro and in-vivo characterization of JNJ-7925476, a novel triple monoamine uptake inhibitor.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/invitro-invivo-characterization-jnj7925476-novel-triple-monoamine-uptake-inhibitor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3925706,"mean":5.010059382671,"rank":897032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2476952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3925706,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120844,"mean":9.0508321223458,"rank":36250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":83158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120844,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1827,"mean":2.2876394520548,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1827,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.4557142857143,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
