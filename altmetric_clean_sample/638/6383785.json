However, neurological and hemorrhagic complications have been seen in recent outbreaks. The clinical manifestations of this disease are similar to those of dengue virus infection, indicating the need for differential diagnosis in areas such as India, which are endemic for both viruses. The aim of the present study was to develop monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and assess their use in MAb-based IgM capture ELISA (MAC ELISA). The ELISA detects CHIKV-specific IgM antibodies, a marker of recent infection, in a patient's serum. One IgG1 and two IgM isotype hybrids were obtained. All of the subclones derived from the IgG1 hybrid recognized the C protein of CHIKV. The anti-C MAb ClVE4\/D9 was the most promising as a detector antibody in MAC ELISA (C-MAb ELISA) yielding higher positive-to-negative (P\/N) ratios. When compared with the CHIKV MAC ELISA kit developed by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune (NIV MAC ELISA), the sensitivity of the test was 87.01\u00a0% with 100\u00a0% specificity. The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were 100\u00a0% and 94.47\u00a0%, respectively. In precision testing, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (% CV) values of the C-MAb ELISA were within acceptable limits. The C-MAb ELISA detected anti-CHIKV IgM in serum of patients up to five months after the onset of infection, indicating that anti-C MAbs have strong potential for use in MAC ELISA to detect recent CHIKV infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000230f","authors":["Damle, R G","Jayaram, N","Kulkarni, S M","Nigade, K","Khutwad, K","Gosavi, S","Parashar, D"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00705-016-2829-4","first_seen_on":"2016-03-30T06:40:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-8798","0304-8608"],"journal":"Archives of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1459362180,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27016930?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27016930","pubdate":"2016-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Diagnostic potential of monoclonal antibodies against the capsid protein of chikungunya virus for detection of recent infection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnostic-potential-monoclonal-antibodies-against-capsid-protein-chikungunya-virus-detection-recent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7465518,"mean":6.4808427461848,"rank":3628096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3648742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7465518,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273100,"mean":11.062931449767,"rank":136869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":125904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273100,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1260,"mean":2.1107895154885,"rank":556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1260,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.4688656716418,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
