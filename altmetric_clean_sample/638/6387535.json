This is an efficient and widespread mechanism of microbial pathogenesis. Previous studies describe toxins that increase cAMP in host cells, resulting in death through G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways by influencing adenylyl cyclase or G protein activity. G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) has a central role in regulation of GPCR desensitization. However, little information is available about the pathogenic mechanisms of toxins associated with GRK2. Here, we reported a new bacterial toxin-Bacillus bombysepticus (Bb) \u03b1-toxin that was lethal to host. We showed that Bb \u03b1-toxin interacted with BmGRK2. The data demonstrated that Bb \u03b1-toxin directly bound to BmGRK2 to promote death by affecting GPCR signaling pathways. This mechanism involved stimulation of G\u03b1s, increase level of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Activated cAMP\/PKA signal transduction altered downstream effectors that affected homeostasis and fundamental biological processes, disturbing the structural and functional integrity of cells, resulting in death. Preventing cAMP\/PKA signaling transduction by inhibitions (NF449 or H-89) substantially reduced the pathogenicity of Bb \u03b1-toxin. The discovery of a toxin-induced host death specifically linked to GRK2 mediated signaling pathway suggested a new model for bacterial toxin action. Characterization of host genes whose expression and function are regulated by Bb \u03b1-toxin and GRK2 will offer a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases caused by pathogens that elevate cAMP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334c","authors":["Lin, Ping","Cheng, Tingcai","Ma, Sanyuan","Gao, Junping","Jin, Shengkai","Jiang, Liang","Xia, Qingyou","Ping Lin","Tingcai Cheng","Sanyuan Ma","Junping Gao","Shengkai Jin","Liang Jiang","Qingyou Xia"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.ppat.1005527","first_seen_on":"2016-03-30T11:43:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1553-7374"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1472297107,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27022742?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plospathogens\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.ppat.1005527&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:%20plospathogens\/NewArticles%20(PLOS%20Pathogens%20-%20New%20Articles)","http:\/\/www.plospathogens.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1005527"],"pmid":"27022742","pubdate":"2016-03-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e1005527","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Bacillus bombysepticus \u03b1-Toxin Binding to G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2 Regulates cAMP\/PKA Signaling Pathway to Induce Host Death","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bacillus-bombysepticus-%CE%B1toxin-binding-g-proteincoupled-receptor-kinase-2-regulates-camppka-signaling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":905699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7368160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279275,"mean":11.299359174144,"rank":44230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":234099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279275,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4884,"mean":13.463098095433,"rank":1406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":3463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4884,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182,"mean":15.529325966851,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
