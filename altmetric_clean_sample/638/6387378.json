Molecular data on human cystic echinococcosis (CE) were limited. We implemented a large genotyping study of hydatid cysts from humans and livestock animals to specify CE's molecular epidemiology and the genetic diversity in Algeria. Fifty-four human CE cysts from patients predominantly admitted in surgical units from Mustapha Hospital, Algiers, and 16 cysts from livestock animals gathered in two geographically distinct slaughterhouses, Tiaret and Tamanrasset, were collected. Molecular characterization was performed using sequencing of two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit I (NDI). In humans, G1 of E. granulosus s.s. was the main genotype (90.7\u00a0%); four samples (7.4\u00a0%) were characterized as E. granulosus s.s. G3 and one cyst as E. canadensis G6 (1.8\u00a0%). This molecular confirmation of E. canadensis G6 human infection in Algeria was observed in a Tuareg female living in a desertic area in Tamanrasset. All cysts from sheep, cattle, and goat were identified as E. granulosus s.s. G1 and the two cysts originating from dromedary as E. canadensis G6. Twenty concatenated haplotypes (COI\u2009+\u2009NDI) were characterized. Among E. granulosus s.s., one haplotype (HL1) was highly predominant in both humans and animals cysts (71.6\u00a0%). This study revealed main occurrence of E. granulosus s.s. in humans and livestock animals, with description of a predominant shared haplotype corresponding to the main worldwide observed haplotype E.granulosus s.s. G1. E. canadensis G6 was limited to South Algeria, in dromedary as well as in human.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003294","authors":["Zait, Houria","Kouidri, Mokhtaria","Grenouillet, Florence Elisabeth","Umhang, G\u00e9rald","Millon, Laurence","Hamrioui, Boussad","Grenouillet, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","Houria Zait","Mokhtaria Kouidri","Florence Elisabeth Grenouillet","G\u00e9rald Umhang","Laurence Millon","Boussad Hamrioui","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Grenouillet"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00436-016-4994-5","first_seen_on":"2016-03-30T11:34:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-1955","0932-0113"],"journal":"Parasitology Research","last_mentioned_on":1498558662,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27021186?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27021186?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27021186","pubdate":"2016-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Molecular characterization of Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto and Echinococcus canadensis in humans and livestock from Algeria","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-characterization-echinococcus-granulosus-sensu-stricto-echinococcus-canadensis-humans-live"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":6094263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2033736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280138,"mean":11.338668251605,"rank":180649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":82866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280138,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1926,"mean":2.1437277922078,"rank":1129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1926,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":2.0249268292683,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/goat_papers\/statuses\/715139547198152704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6387378],"posted_on":"2016-03-30T11:32:09+00:00","author":{"name":"goatpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558367908275822592\/MZjFXuZV_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"goat_papers","tweeter_id":"2992530750","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":52},"tweet_id":"715139547198152704"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/statuses\/715395716869332993","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6387378],"posted_on":"2016-03-31T04:30:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
