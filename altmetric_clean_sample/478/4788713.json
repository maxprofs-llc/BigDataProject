Despite the ubiquity of such interfaces, the importance of convective mass transport within the near-interface region of a polymer is a fundamental process that is still poorly defined. As a step towards better defining mass transport behavior within the near-interface portion of a polymer, in this work, a new application of a spectroscopic method based on the combination of F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and total internal reflectance fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), is reported that allows quantification of the penetration depth of a laminar flow field (i.e. the slip length) in a densely-grafted, thin poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) film as a model polymer system. Specifically, decay curves from FRET of an acceptor with a donor attached at the substrate surface are fit to a combined Taylor-Aris-Fickian mass transport model to extract apparent linear diffusion coefficients of acceptor molecules for different flow rates. Apparent diffusion coefficients range from 1.9 x 10^-12 to 9.1 x 10^-12 cm2\/s for near-surface flow linear velocities ranging from 192 to 2,952 \u03bcm\/s. This increase in apparent diffusion coefficient with fluid flow rate suggests increasing contributions from convective mass transport that are indicative of flow field penetration into the polymer film. The depth of penetration of the flow field is estimated to range from ~6% of the polymer film thickness in a good solvent at ~192 \u03bcm\/s to ~60% of the film thickness at ~2,952 \u03bcm\/s. Thus, flow field penetration into polymer thin films, with its concomitant contributions from convective mass transport within the near-interface region of the polymer, is demonstrated and quantified experimentally.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Huan Wang"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b03751","first_seen_on":"2015-11-20T16:04:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6882"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1448035433,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b03751"],"pmid":"26558486","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Flow Field Penetration in Thin Nanoporous Polymer Films under Laminar Flow by F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer Coupled with Total Internal Reflectance Fluorescence Microscopy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/flow-field-penetration-thin-nanoporous-polymer-films-under-laminar-flow-f%C3%B6rster-resonance-energy-tra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6588247,"mean":6.1137480774097,"rank":4874087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":967482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6588247,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248262,"mean":9.2918584070797,"rank":168744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":51897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248262,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5952,"mean":3.1982655015964,"rank":3653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5952,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":3.881,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
