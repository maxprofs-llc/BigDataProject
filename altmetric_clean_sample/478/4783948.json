The current study aims to assess whether alginate in a bread vehicle maintains its inhibition properties despite cooking and digestion, and may therefore be used as a potential treatment for obesity. After 180\u00a0min in a model gut that replicates digestion in the mouth, stomach and small intestines alginate bread (AB), control bread (CB), CB with Manucol(\u00ae) DM alginate, free DM alginate and model gut solution were collected. DM, LFR 5\/60 and SF200 were heated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 200\u00a0\u00b0C, with DM also heated at 50, 100 and 150\u00a0\u00b0C. Samples from the model gut and heated alginate were assessed for molecular size and inhibition properties using viscosity, gel filtration and a lipase turbidity assay. AB does not significantly increase viscosity in the model gut. Viscosity of alginate reduces beyond 100\u00a0\u00b0C, although alginate retains its inhibition properties up to 150\u00a0\u00b0C. Cooking into the bread does not reduce the molecular size of the alginate or affect its inhibition properties. These data demonstrate the robustness of alginates lipase inhibition despite the cooking process and digestion. Therefore adding alginate to a bread vehicle may have the potential in the treatment for obesity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f7","authors":["David Houghton","Matthew D. Wilcox","Peter I.
