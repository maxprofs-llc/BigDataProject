Key to this disparity is late stage at diagnosis, a consequence of low rates of screening.\nThis article describes the establishment and community engagement efforts of the Milwaukee Consortium for Hmong Health, established in 2008 to build capacity to investigate and address barriers to screening and cancer care.\nThe Consortium facilitated a series of three community dialogues to explore with community members effective ways to overcome barriers to accessing screening and cancer care.\nThe community dialogues produced a series of six recommendations for action, detailed herein, supported and prioritized by the community.\nWe posit that the integral involvement of the Hmong community from the outset promoted buy-in of ensuing Consortium education and outreach efforts, and helped to ensure fit with community perspectives, needs, and priorities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008626","authors":["Shannon M.A. Sparks","Pang C.
