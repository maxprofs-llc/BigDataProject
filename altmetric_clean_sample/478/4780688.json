A descriptive qualitative approach utilizes inductive content analysis to investigate 145 student survey responses. The assignment assists student nurses in understanding that physical and mental well-being are intrinsically linked. Students report increased comfort performing a physical examination on patients with mental illness post assignment. Students' initial bias towards this population was minimized post the clinical assignment. Poor physical health is common among people with mental health problems. Many view the provision of care as a major public health issue. Nurses are the front line caregivers of mental health service consumers and are well positioned to assess their physical needs. Their assessment may be the first step in recognizing health care issues in this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005696","authors":["Martin, Carolyn T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nepr.2015.11.001","first_seen_on":"2015-11-18T20:11:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-5953","1873-5223"],"journal":"Nurse Education in Practice","last_mentioned_on":1462643283,"links":["http:\/\/www.nurseeducationinpractice.com\/article\/S1471-5953(15)00182-1\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nurseeducationinpractice.com\/article\/S1471595315001821\/pdf","pmid":"26643656","pubdate":"2015-12-09T22:03:25+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","education"],"title":"Getting physical in mental health nursing","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/value-physical-examination-mental-health-nursing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7662843,"mean":6.5825569912527,"rank":5796250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1032121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7662843,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288960,"mean":8.8595005589026,"rank":197966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":50360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288960,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289,"mean":2.763125,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.7083333333333,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NurseEdinPrac\/statuses\/667072553773498369","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4780688],"posted_on":"2015-11-18T20:11:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Nurse Edu in Practic","url":"http:\/\/www.nurseeducationinpractice.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590841096290336770\/PWZ-qevN_normal.jpg","description":"Leading international journal promoting interprofessional learning and working.
