This study was to compare UCEIS and the Mayo ES for evaluating UC severity and outcomes in patients undergoing remission induction during routine clinical practice with interest to predict medium to long-term prognosis.\nForty-one UC patients who received colonoscopy before and after tacrolimus remission induction therapy were included. UC clinical activity index and endoscopic findings scored by both the UCEIS and the Mayo ES were determined. The changes in the UCEIS and the Mayo ES before and after induction therapy were compared.\nThe mean UCEIS improved from 6.2\u00b10.9 to 3.4\u00b12.1 (P<0.001). Based on the UCEIS, a significant level was reached in both the response and the remission groups. In contrast, the Mayo ES did not reflect significant change in the response group. The discrepancy appeared to be due to ulcers becoming smaller and shallower during the early stages of mucosal healing; Mayo ES seems to miss these early changes. In other words, whereas, the UCEIS indicates improvements when ulcers shrink, the Mayo ES does not distinguish deep ulcers from shallow ulcers, remains 3 (severe UC). Additionally, better UCEIS strata after induction therapy were associated with lower incidence of colectomy (P=0.0001) or relapse (P=0.0008).\nThe UCEIS accurately reflects clinical outcomes and predicts medium to long-term prognosis in UC patients undergoing induction therapy. These findings should support decision making in clinical practice settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c29","authors":["Ikeya, Kentaro","Hanai, Hiroyuki","Sugimoto, Ken","Osawa, Satoshi","Kawasaki, Shinsuke","Iida, Takayuki","Maruyama, Yasuhiko","Watanabe, Fumitoshi"],"doi":"10.1093\/ecco-jcc\/jjv210","first_seen_on":"2015-11-20T11:31:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-4479","1873-9946"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Crohn's and Colitis","last_mentioned_on":1464914814,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26581895?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/ecco-jcc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/15\/ecco-jcc.jjv210","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26581895"],"pmid":"26581895","pubdate":"2015-11-20T22:00:56+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"The Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity More Accurately Reflects Clinical Outcomes and Long-term Prognosis than the Mayo Endoscopic Score","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ulcerative-colitis-endoscopic-index-severity-more-accurately-reflects-clinical-outcomes-longterm-pro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7849747,"mean":6.6509658923939,"rank":3649090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4025063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7849747,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290651,"mean":8.8881671907791,"rank":123038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":157451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290651,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":758,"mean":9.8870330250991,"rank":287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":758,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":3.0229166666667,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
