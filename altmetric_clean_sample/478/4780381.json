The introduction of endoscopic surgery has revolutionized the management of sinus and skull base disorder. Similarly, endoscopic techniques have been increasingly utilized to access intraorbital tumors located in the medial and inferior orbit with excellent outcomes. The history of the procedure, surgical anatomy of the orbit, patient selection, surgical planning, and the surgical techniques are discussed in this article.\nAlthough the endoscopic management of orbital tumors is still in its infancy, it has already demonstrated enhanced access to the posterior orbit and orbital apex with decreased morbidity relative to external approaches.\nA multidisciplinary team approach, including an oculoplastic surgeon, is an essential component for the surgical planning and management. As the cumulative surgical experience increases, the indications for this approach will likely continue to expand.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005868","authors":["Yao, William C","Bleier, Benjamin S"],"doi":"10.1097\/moo.0000000000000215","first_seen_on":"2015-11-18T19:04:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1531-6998"],"journal":"Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery","last_mentioned_on":1447873415,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26575515?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26575515","pubdate":"2015-11-18T22:00:23+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Endoscopic management of orbital tumors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endoscopic-management-orbital-tumors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6581713,"mean":6.1066319197804,"rank":3130152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1964858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6581713,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248219,"mean":9.2789005470997,"rank":130098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":91691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248219,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":449,"mean":1.6089285714286,"rank":202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":449,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.4,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
