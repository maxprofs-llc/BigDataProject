Combining scanning tunneling microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory, we characterize the chemical and electronic aspects of the interconnections between ribbons. We demonstrate how the substrate effects of our self-assembly can be exploited to fabricate graphene structures connected to desired electrodes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Patrick Han"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.5b04879","first_seen_on":"2015-11-20T18:54:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-086X"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1452708000,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsnano.5b04879","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26588477?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acsnano.5b04879","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1021\/acsnano.5b04879"],"pmid":"26588477","pubdate":"2015-11-21T11:24:36+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Self-Assembly Strategy for Fabricating Connected Graphene Nanoribbons","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfassembly-strategy-fabricating-connected-graphene-nanoribbons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":83.12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":83.12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":76447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":6881510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279895,"mean":8.7433968645271,"rank":5588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":274307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279895,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4488,"mean":10.66872698908,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":4373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4488,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":15.560417910448,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
