The general concept is to label both sides of the ultrathin section with the thickness of 70-80 nm with different antibodies conjugated to gold nanoparticles and to distinguish the labeled side by advanced imaging methods with high resolution scanning electron microscopy, such as by correlating images acquired at different energies of primary electrons using different signals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823b","authors":["Nebesarova, Jana","Wandrol, Petr","Vancova, Marie"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nano.2015.09.008","first_seen_on":"2015-11-18T20:48:57+00:00","issns":["1549-9642","1549-9634"],"journal":"Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1447879713,"links":["http:\/\/www.nanomedjournal.com\/article\/S1549-9634(15)00186-0\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nanomedjournal.com\/article\/S1549963415001860\/pdf","pmid":"26472050","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology","biotechnology"],"title":"Novel method of simultaneous multiple immunogold localization on resin sections in high resolution scanning electron microscopy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-method-simultaneous-multiple-immunogold-localization-resin-sections-high-resolution-scanning-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6581713,"mean":6.1066319197804,"rank":5615432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6581713,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248220,"mean":9.2788746469852,"rank":196353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248220,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":648,"mean":5.3353972179289,"rank":465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":648,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":5.9404897959184,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
