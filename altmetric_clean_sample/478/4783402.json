Baseline data, treatment characteristics and follow-up MRI were retrospectively recorded. The status of recanalization was assessed as complete (CRec), partial (PRec) or failed recanalization. Clinical follow-up was measured with the modified Rankin Scale. Excellent outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale 0-1.\nNinety-nine patients were identified; 97% of these patients were treated with oral anticoagulation (OAC) and the median (min-max) time of OAC was 7 months (1-84). CRec was achieved in 57.6% (57\/99), PRec in 29.3% (29\/99) and only 13 (13.1%) patients did not recanalize. The median (min-max) time to PRec was 4 months (0.25-14) and to CRec 6 months (2-34). Median time to last clinical follow-up was 8 months (1-88); 91.8% (89\/99) had an excellent outcome at last clinical follow-up and only 2.1% (2\/99) died. Only thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus was independently associated with successful recanalization (odds ratio 16, 95% confidence interval 2-138). No severe haemorrhagic complications and no recurrence of CSVT occurred within clinical follow-up. No association of outcome and recanalization status was found.\nThe recanalization rate of CSVT under OAC was high and the median time to CRec was 6 months. Thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus is a positive predictor of recanalization. Outcome in this cohort was excellent but no significant association of outcome and recanalization status was found.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002840","authors":["Herweh, C.","Griebe, M.","Geisb\u00fcsch, C.","Szabo, K.","Neumaier\u2010Probst, E.","Hennerici, M.
