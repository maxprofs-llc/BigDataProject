This study sought to evaluate the capacities of culture media, cell-free medium, and crude lysate preparations (containing PHB inclusion bodies) from bacterial cell cultures to stabilize emulsions with several hydrophobic compounds. Four conditions showed good production of bioemulsifiers (E24\u2009\u2265\u200950\u00a0%), headed by substantially cell-free media from bacterial cell cultures in which bacterial isolates from Burkholderia sp. strain AB4 and Pseudomonas sp. strain AS1 were grown. Our results revealed that the both isolates (AB4 and AS1 strains) exhibited high emulsification indices (indicating usefulness in bioremediation) and good stabilities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a88","authors":["Sacco, La\u00eds Postai","Castellane, Tereza Cristina Luque","Lopes, Erica Mendes","de Macedo Lemos, Eliana Gertrudes","Alves, L\u00facia Maria Carareto"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12010-015-1923-5","first_seen_on":"2015-11-19T14:06:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-0291"],"journal":"Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1447941976,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26578147?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26578147","pubdate":"2015-11-19T22:01:03+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Properties of Polyhydroxyalkanoate Granules and Bioemulsifiers from Pseudomonas sp. and Burkholderia sp.
