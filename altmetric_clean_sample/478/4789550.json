Studies on PsD are often limited by use of administrative coding, incomplete follow-up, and lack of preoperative data on psychopharmacological treatment.\nA multicenter study with prospective registration on preoperative comorbidity, complete 90-day follow-up, and information on dispensed prescriptions on psychopharmacological treatment (excluding benzodiazepines). All departments used similar fast-track approaches and discharge to home. Evaluation of postoperative morbidity was based on discharge records. Odds ratios for length of stay (LOS) more than 4 days and surgery-related readmissions were calculated using multiple logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders.\nOf 8,757 procedures, 1,001 (11.4%) were in PsD patients. Of these, 43.4% used selective serotonin inhibitors (SSRIs), 31.6% used other antidepressants, 8.5% used a combination, and 16.5% used antipsychotics. PsD was associated with increased risk of LOS more than 4 days (16.5 vs. 7.3%; odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.52 to 2.37), regardless of treatment with SSRIs (2.19; 1.62 to 2.97), other antidepressants (1.81; 1.25 to 2.61), or antipsychotics (1.90; 1.62 to 3.16). PsD was associated with increased 30- (9.9 vs. 5.1%; 1.93; 1.49 to 2.49) and 90-day surgery-related readmissions (12.8 vs. 7.4%; 1.68; 1.34 to 2.10), significant for SSRIs (1.97; 1.38 to 2.82 and 1.77; 1.29 to 2.43), other antidepressants (2.24; 1.51 to 3.32 and 1.82; 1.27 to 2.61), and antipsychotics (1.85; 1.03 to 3.31, 30 days only). In PsD patients, pain (1.4%), postoperative anemia (1.1%), and pulmonary complications (1.1%) were the most frequent causes of LOS more than 4 days. Hip displacements (2.8%) and falls (1.9%) were the most frequent readmissions, and 90-day surgery-related mortality was 0.7% with and 0.2% without PsD.\nPsychopharmacologically treated PsD is a risk factor for postoperative morbidity after fast-track arthroplasty, regardless of treatment type. This may be due to PsD per se and\/or drug-related side effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002255","authors":["Christoffer C.
