The access to safe drinking water is decreasing in the world, which can have a huge socio-economic impact especially in developing countries, more prone to water-associated diseases. The goal of this work was to develop an innovative, fast and cost-effective 3D material capable of decontaminating water. We have used an eco-friendly strategy, combining plasma surface activation and supercritical fluid technology to produce, for the first time, a 2-oxazoline-grafted 3D surface with broad-spectrum contact-active antimicrobial properties. Oligo(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) quaternized with N,N-dimethyldodecylamine grafted to a chitosan (CHT) scaffold (CHT-OMetOx-DDA) efficiently and quickly (<3 min) killed >99.999% of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli cells upon direct contact and to avoid bacterial adhesion to the materials surface, which is important for the prevention of biofilm formation. As a proof of concept, CHT-OMetOx-DDA scaffold was demonstrated to be suitable for water purification efficiently killing the microorganisms present in different water samples within minutes of contact and without leaching to the water. Additionally, we report for the first time a new method to clearly distinguish two mechanisms of action of bioactive surfaces: contact-active and releasing systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e5","authors":["Correia, Vanessa G","Ferraria, Ana M","Pinho, Mariana G","Aguiar-Ricardo, Ana"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.biomac.5b01243","first_seen_on":"2015-11-19T11:15:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-4602"],"journal":"Biomacromolecules","last_mentioned_on":1447931734,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26580224?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26580224","pubdate":"2015-11-19T22:00:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Antimicrobial contact-active oligo(2-oxazoline)s-grafted surfaces for fast water disinfection at the point-of-use.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antimicrobial-contactactive-oligo2oxazolinesgrafted-surfaces-fast-water-disinfection-pointofuse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6585900,"mean":6.1107691393388,"rank":5618785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6585900,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248316,"mean":9.279023071502,"rank":196415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248316,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":836,"mean":4.8773964071856,"rank":615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.2173076923077,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
