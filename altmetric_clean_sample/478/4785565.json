The examination of neuronal nAChRs in living humans is a relatively new field. Researchers have developed brain-imaging radiotracers for nAChRs, with radiolabeled A-85380 compounds having the most widespread use. We provide a brief background on nAChRs, followed by a discussion of the development and application of A-85380 radiotracers in human imaging studies. We describe potential future studies using nicotinic receptor radioligands for the study of tobacco addiction, including the mechanism of action of the smoking-cessation therapy varenicline. Throughout this review, we focus on the significant potential that resides in the identification and quantification of nAChRs in the living human brain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003b39","authors":["Lotfipour, Shahrdad","Mandelkern, Mark","Brody, Arthur L"],"doi":"10.2174\/157340511795445676","first_seen_on":"2015-11-19T21:56:56+00:00","issns":["1573-4056"],"issue":"2","journal":"Current Medical Imaging Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1447978411,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22773924?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3389797","pmid":"22773924","pubdate":"2011-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Quantitative Molecular Imaging of Neuronal Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in the Human Brain with A-85380 Radiotracers.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-molecular-imaging-neuronal-nicotinic-acetylcholine-receptors-human-brain-a85380-radiotr-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6588189,"mean":6.1136806244756,"rank":4874092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":967499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6588189,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248372,"mean":9.2806723329214,"rank":168829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":51909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248372,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.2,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
