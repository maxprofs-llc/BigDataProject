Salidroside is a principal active ingredient of Rhodiola rosea and has recently been reported to protect against lung injures. The present study was aimed at exploring its therapeutic effects on PF. Lung fibrotic injuries were induced in SD rats by a single intratracheal instillation of 5\u00a0mg\/kg bleomycin (BLM). Then, these rats were administrated with 50, 100, or 200\u00a0mg\/kg salidroside for 28\u00a0days. BLM-triggered structure distortion, collagen overproduction, excessive inflammatory infiltration, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and oxidative stress damages in lung tissues were attenuated by salidroside in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, salidroside was noted to inhibit I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65 nuclear accumulation while activating Nrf2-antioxidant signaling in BLM-treated lungs. Downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin, fibronectin, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) indicated an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like shift in BLM-treated lungs. These changes were suppressed by salidroside. The expression of TGF-\u03b21 and the phosphorylation of its downstream targets, Smad-2\/-3, were enhanced by BLM, but weakened by salidroside. Additionally, salidroside was capable of reversing the recombinant TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT-like changes in alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. Our study reveals that salidroside's protective effects against fibrotic lung injuries are correlated to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antifibrotic properties.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e20","authors":["Tang, Haiying","Gao, Lili","Mao, Jingwei","He, Huanyu","Liu, Jia","Cai, Xin","Lin, Hongli","Wu, Taihua"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12192-015-0654-4","first_seen_on":"2015-11-20T04:20:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1466-1268"],"journal":"Cell Stress and Chaperones","last_mentioned_on":1447993234,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26577463?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26577463","pubdate":"2015-11-20T22:02:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Salidroside protects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis: activation of Nrf2-antioxidant signaling, and inhibition of NF-\u03baB and TGF-\u03b21\/Smad-2\/-3 pathways.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salidroside-protects-against-bleomycininduced-pulmonary-fibrosis-activation-nrf2antioxidant-signalin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6588189,"mean":6.1136806244756,"rank":5620752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6588189,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248261,"mean":9.2919145653751,"rank":196356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248261,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193,"mean":2.0599375,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.54545454545455,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/667558124090339328","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4786584],"posted_on":"2015-11-20T04:20:34+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
