We estimated the cost-effectiveness from a UK National Health Service perspective, based on the results of FAMOUS.\nA mixed trial- and model-based approach using decision and statistical modelling was used. Within-trial (1-year) costs and QALYs were assembled at the individual level and then modelled on subsequent management strategy [coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or medical therapy (MT)] and major adverse coronary events (death, MI, stroke and revascularisation). One-year resource uses included: material, hospitalisation, medical, health professional service use and events. Utilities were derived from individual EQ5D responses. Unit costs were derived from the literature. Outcomes were extended to a lifetime on the basis of MACE during the 1st year. Costs and QALYs were modelled using generalized linear models whilst MACE was modelled using logistic regression. The analysis adopted a payer perspective. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5\u00a0%.\nCosts were related to the subsequent management strategy and MACE whilst QALYs were not. FFR led to a modest cost increase, albeit an imprecise increase, over both the trial [\u00a3112 (-\u00a3129 to \u00a3357)] and lifetime horizons [\u00a3133 (-\u00a3199 to \u00a3499)]. FFR led to a small, albeit imprecise, increase in QALYs over both the trial [0.02 (-0.03 to 0.06)] and lifetime horizons [0.03 (-0.21 to 0.28)]. The mean ICER was \u00a37516\/QALY and \u00a34290\/QALY over the trial and lifetime horizons, respectively. Decision remained high; FFR had 64 and 59\u00a0% probability of cost-effectiveness over trial and lifetime horizons, respectively.\nFFR was cost-effective at the mean, albeit with considerable decision uncertainty. Uncertainty can be reduced with more information on long-term health events.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b4","authors":["Nam, Julian","Briggs, Andrew","Layland, Jamie","Oldroyd, Keith G","Curzen, Nick","Sood, Arvind","Balachandran, Kanarath","Das, Raj","Junejo, Shahid","Eteiba, Hany","Petrie, Mark C","Lindsay, Mitchell","Watkins, Stuart","Corbett, Simon","O'Rourke, Brian","O'Donnell, Anna","Stewart, Andrew","Hannah, Andrew","McConnachie, Alex","Henderson, Robert","Berry, Colin","Julian Nam","Andrew Briggs","Jamie Layland","Keith G.
