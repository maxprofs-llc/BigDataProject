Caring for people who have experienced a stroke is a challenging issue. The Registered Nurses Association of Ontario (RNAO) developed Stroke Assessment Across the Continuum Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs) to support the best possible care for this population. This article reports the findings of an evaluation of the implementation of recommendations from the stroke BPGs using a Knowledge Transfer Team (KTT) at Mackenzie Health's Integrated Stroke Unit in Richmond Hill, Ontario.\nOver a 12-month period, an evaluation of the implementation activities using structure, process, and outcome indicators, as well as identifying effective strategies for system-wide dissemination of BPG implementation and outcomes was completed. Data were collected from the staff, KTT members, and patients and their providers.\nThe results clearly illustrate that all of the health care professionals involved in the study felt the KT approach was an effective method of implementing and disseminating the stroke BPGs. The main limitations perceived by staff and KTT members were time constraints, difficulty recruiting a larger sample size, competing priorities, lack of compliance, changes to charting, staff attrition, and a lack of financial support.\nThe KTT approach resulted in improved patient care and outcomes, as illustrated by the high patient satisfaction levels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057bf","authors":["Singh, Mina","Hynie, Michaela","Rivera, Tiziana","Macisaac, Laura","Gladman, Annie","Cheng, Abel"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-19T00:28:35+00:00","issns":["1913-7176"],"issue":"1","journal":"Canadian Journal of Neuroscience Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1447892898,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26152100?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26152100","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing","neurology"],"title":"An evaluation study of the implementation of stroke best practice guidelines using a Knowledge Transfer Team approach.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-study-implementation-stroke-best-practice-guidelines-using-knowledge-transfer-team-approa-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6585900,"mean":6.1107691393388,"rank":5618762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6585900,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248317,"mean":9.2789919457466,"rank":196414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248317,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.5,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
