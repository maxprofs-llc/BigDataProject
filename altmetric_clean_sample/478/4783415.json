Pearson correlations were used to compare expression between media.\nNumerous microRNAs were detected and overlapping from specific bio-specimen sources. MiR-4454 and miR-21 overexpression was found in three sources: tumor, WBCs and urine. Additionally, miR-15b-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-93-5p, and miR-150-5p were common to tumor\/WBCs, while miR-720\/3007a, miR-205, miR-200c-3p and miR-29b-3p common to tumor\/urine. Significant associations were noted between the log-adjusted average miRNA counts in tumor vs. WBCs (r\u2009=\u20090.418 p\u2009<\u20090.001), and tumor vs. urine (r\u2009=\u20090.38 p\u2009<\u20090.001). No association was seen tumor vs. plasma exosome miRs (r\u2009=\u20090.07 p\u2009=\u20090.06).\nMicroRNA profiling from matched samples in patients shows a significant number of microRNAs up regulated in bladder tumors are identifiable in urine exosomes and WBCs of the same patient, but not in blood plasma. This study demonstrated varying relationships between miRNA detected in biological media from the same patient, and serves to inform the potential of urine-based microRNAs as biomarkers for bladder cancer and potentially other malignancies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000873","authors":["David A.
