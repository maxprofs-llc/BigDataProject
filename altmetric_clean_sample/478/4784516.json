In this regard, the biological engineering (i.e. biotechnology) and biomedical engineering fields have a vested interest in constructing more precise and accurate voltammetric\/amperometric biosensors. One rapidly growing area of biosensor design involves the incorporation of carbon-based nanomaterials in the working electrodes, i.e. carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene and graphene oxide. In this review article, we give a brief overview describing the main voltammetric techniques and how these techniques are applied in biosensing, as well as details surrounding the important biosensing concepts of sensitivity and limits of detection. Building on these important concepts we show how the sensitivity and limit of detection can be tuned by including carbon-based nanomaterials in the fabrication of biosensors. The sensing of biomolecules, i.e. glucose, dopamine, proteins, enzymes, uric acid, DNA, RNA, H2O2 etc., traditionally employs enzymes in detection, however these enzymes denature easily and as such enzymless methods are highly desired. In this regard, we draw an important distinction between enzymless and enzyme containing carbon nanomaterial based biosensors. The review ends with an outlook of future concepts that can be employed in biosensor fabrication, as well as limitations of already proposed materials and how these materials can be enhanced As such, this review can act as a roadmap to guide researchers towards concepts that can be employed in the design of next generation biosensors while also highlighting the current advancements in the field.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Tiwari, Jitendra N","Vij, Varun","Kemp, K Christian","Kim, Kwang S"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.5b05690","first_seen_on":"2015-11-19T16:21:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-086X"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1450307932,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26579616?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsnano.5b05690"],"pmid":"26579616","pubdate":"2015-11-19T22:00:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Engineered Carbon-Nanomaterial-Based Electrochemical Sensors for Biomolecules","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/engineered-carbonnanomaterialbased-electrochemical-sensors-biomolecules"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6777408,"mean":6.1700063558217,"rank":2390734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4336075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6777408,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277273,"mean":8.6960673778816,"rank":88003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":186976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277273,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4411,"mean":10.548433106576,"rank":2119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4411,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":16.125515151515,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Ph.
