However, no studies have examined Europe as a whole. The present study aims to analyze CF mortality trends by gender within the European Union (EU) and to quantify potential years of life lost (PYLL).\nDeaths from the 27\u2009EU countries were obtained from the statistical office of the EU from the years 1994-2010. Crude and age-standardized mortality rates (ASR) were estimated for women and men using the standard European population, expressed in deaths per 1,000,000 persons. The PYLL from ages 0 up to 30 years were estimated. Trends were studied by a joinpoint regression analysis.\nDuring the study period, 5,130 deaths (2,443 in males and 2,687 in females) were identified. Females had a slightly higher mortality rate than males, with a downward trend observed for both genders. In males, the ASR changed from 1.34 in 1994 to 1.03 in 2010. In females, the ASR changed from 1.42 in 1994 to 0.92 in 2010. The mean age at death and PYLL increased for both genders. The joinpoint analysis did not identify any significant joinpoint for either gender for ASR or PYLL.\nOur data suggest a continued downward trend of CF mortality throughout the EU, with differences by country and gender.
