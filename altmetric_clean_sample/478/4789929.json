Vaccination as public health intervention could be the most effective way to reduce this burden. TBE vaccines are available, but vaccines against LB are still in the phase of development. At the European level, TBE vaccines are likely under-administered to effectively prevent the disease. Cost-effectiveness of vaccination is a helpful tool in the decision making process to include novel vaccines in the national vaccination program or to extend current programs, and its role is only increasing. Cost-effectiveness studies on TBE vaccines have been performed in Slovenia, Sweden, Finland and Estonia so far. Cost-effectiveness studies with the novel vaccines against LB are expected to be performed in the near future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073db","authors":["Renata \u0160mit","\u0160mit, Renata","Postma, Maarten J","Maarten J Postma"],"doi":"10.1586\/14760584.2016.1111142","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2015-11-21T00:26:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-8395","1476-0584"],"issue":"1","journal":"Expert Review of Vaccines","last_mentioned_on":1448065569,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/14760584.2016.1111142?ai=1pdbv&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"26559456","pubdate":"2015-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"5","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Vaccines for tick-borne diseases and cost-effectiveness of vaccination: a public health challenge to reduce the diseases\u2019 burden","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/14760584.2016.1111142","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vaccines-tickborne-diseases-costeffectiveness-vaccination-public-health-challenge-reduce-diseases-bu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6589635,"mean":6.1154988547167,"rank":5621776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6589635,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248235,"mean":9.2876002562099,"rank":196347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248235,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":574,"mean":4.0014869109948,"rank":434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":574,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":14.830974358974,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
