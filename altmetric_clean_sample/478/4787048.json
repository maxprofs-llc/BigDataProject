The objectives of the study were to evaluate the characteristics of successful prosthetic users and to determine what factors are associated with successful prosthetic fitting and use.\nThe authors identified 43 patients who underwent hip disarticulation\/hemipelvectomy between 2000 and 2010 and were candidates for prosthetic fitting at the authors' institution. The medical records of these patients were then reviewed for pertinent demographic and medical characteristics to identify the profile of successful prosthetic users.\nOf 43 patients, 18 (43%) successfully used a prosthetic limb. The only preoperative factor associated with unsuccessful prosthetic fitting was coronary artery disease. Specifically, age, body mass index, other medical comorbidities, and demographic characteristics were not associated with successful or unsuccessful prosthetic fitting. Successful users wore their prosthesis an average of 5.8 hrs\/day, and most ambulated with one or both hands free.\nSuccessful prosthetic rehabilitation after hemipelvectomy and hip disarticulation is possible. Increased body mass index, advanced age, depression, and other comorbidities should not discourage prosthetic rehabilitation. Most patients that undergo prosthetic rehabilitation enjoy long periods of survival and wear their prosthesis for most of the day.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000220a","authors":["Kralovec, Michael E","Houdek, Matthew T","Andrews, Karen L","Shives, Thomas C","Rose, Peter S","Sim, Franklin H"],"doi":"10.1097\/phm.0000000000000292","first_seen_on":"2015-11-20T08:33:53+00:00","issns":["1537-7385","0894-9115"],"issue":"12","journal":"American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1448008415,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ajpmr\/Abstract\/2015\/12000\/Prosthetic_Rehabilitation_After_Hip.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ajpmr\/2015\/12000\/Prosthetic_Rehabilitation_After_Hip.3.pdf","pmid":"25888656","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1035","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Prosthetic Rehabilitation After Hip Disarticulation or Hemipelvectomy","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prosthetic-rehabilitation-after-hip-disarticulation-hemipelvectomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6588247,"mean":6.1137480774097,"rank":5620757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6588247,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248261,"mean":9.2918996616451,"rank":196357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248261,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":806,"mean":4.4063180124224,"rank":699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":806,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":14.1052,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
