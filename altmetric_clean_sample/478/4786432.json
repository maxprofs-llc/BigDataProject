By exploiting metabolic glycan engineering of cell membrane proteins, we developed an in situ glycan-mediated ligand-controlled click (\"GLiCo-Click\") chemistry methodology that enables the attachment of small molecule chemical probes to their receptor protein through glycans on live cells. In addition to enabling receptor enrichment from cell lysates, this strategy can be used to demonstrate target receptor engagement and enables the molecular characterization of receptors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd9","authors":["Stoeckmann, Henning","Marin, Violeta L","Nimmer, Paul","Balut, Corina","Davidson, Donald","Richardson, Paul","Vasudevan, Anil","St\u00f6ckmann, Henning","Marin, Violeta L.","Balut, Corina M.","Davidson, Donald J.","Richardson, Paul L."],"doi":"10.1002\/cbic.201500590","endpage":"154","first_seen_on":"2015-11-20T03:06:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1439-7633"],"issue":"2","journal":"ChemBioChem","last_mentioned_on":1449499418,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cbic.201500590"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201500590\/pdf","pmid":"26574896","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"150","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Glycan\u2010mediated ligand\u2010controlled click chemistry for small molecule target identification","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glycanmediated-ligandcontrolled-click-chemistry-drugtarget-identification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6690562,"mean":6.1568806433399,"rank":2229506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4431206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6690562,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275789,"mean":8.6691048559037,"rank":81237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":192730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275789,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1717,"mean":2.4858741258741,"rank":278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1717,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":2.6662280701754,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
