ANIMALS Blood samples from six 8- to 30-week-old healthy male pigs for the in vitro experiment and sixty-five 3-week-old specific pathogen-free pigs. PROCEDURES Neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages were isolated from blood samples. Isolated cells were exposed to tulathromycin (0.02 to 2.0 mg\/mL) for various durations and assessed for markers of apoptosis and efferocytosis. For in vivo experiments, pigs were inoculated intratracheally with A pleuropneumoniae, zymosan, or PBS solution (control group) with or without tulathromycin pretreatment (2.5 mg\/kg, IM). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected 3 and 24 hours after inoculation and analyzed for proinflammatory mediators, leukocyte apoptosis, and efferocytosis. RESULTS In vitro, tulathromycin induced time- and concentration-dependent apoptosis in neutrophils, which enhanced their subsequent clearance by macrophages. In the lungs of both A pleuropneumoniae- and zymosan-challenged pigs, tulathromycin promoted leukocyte apoptosis and efferocytosis and inhibited proinflammatory leukotriene B4 production, with a concurrent reduction in leukocyte necrosis relative to that of control pigs. Tulathromycin also attenuated the degree of lung damage and lesion progression in A pleuropneumoniae-inoculated pigs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Tulathromycin had immunomodulatory effects in leukocytes in vitro and anti-inflammatory effects in pigs in experimental models of A pleuropneumoniae infection and nonmicrobial-induced pulmonary inflammation. These data suggested that in addition to its antimicrobial properties, tulathromycin may dampen severe proinflammatory responses and drive resolution of inflammation in pigs with microbial pulmonary infections.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002221","authors":["Duquette, Stephanie C","Fischer, Carrie D","Williams, Alison C","Sajedy, Saman","Feener, Troy D","Bhargava, Amol","Reti, Kristen L","Muench, Gregory P","Morck, Douglas W","Allison, Jim","Lucas, Merlyn J","Buret, Andre G"],"doi":"10.2460\/ajvr.76.6.507","first_seen_on":"2015-11-19T07:24:26+00:00","issns":["1943-5681"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1447917847,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26000598?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26000598","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Immunomodulatory effects of tulathromycin on apoptosis, efferocytosis, and proinflammatory leukotriene B4 production in leukocytes from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae-or zymosan-challenged pigs.","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunomodulatory-effects-tulathromycin-apoptosis-efferocytosis-proinflammatory-leukotriene-b4-produc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6585900,"mean":6.1107691393388,"rank":5618770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6585900,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248317,"mean":9.2789941606663,"rank":196414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248317,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":790,"mean":2.7535741444867,"rank":566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":790,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":3.4954545454545,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
