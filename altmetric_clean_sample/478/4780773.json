Under simple reaction conditions, various di-, tri- and tetrasubstituted racemic allene products could be obtained in high yields. The asymmetric 1,6-addition of silyl group to the (Z)-2-alken-4-ynoates could be achieved under mild reaction conditions to afford the silyl-substituted chiral allene products in good yields and with high enantioselectivities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Min Wang"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.5b08279","first_seen_on":"2015-11-18T20:45:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1447879517,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/jacs.5b08279"],"pmid":"26560851","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of Highly Substituted Racemic and Enantioenriched Allenylsilanes via Copper-Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of (Z)-2-Alken-4-ynoates with Silylboronate","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-highly-substituted-racemic-enantioenriched-allenylsilanes-via-coppercatalyzed-hydrosilylat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6581713,"mean":6.1066319197804,"rank":5615432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6581713,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248220,"mean":9.2788746469851,"rank":196353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248220,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16625,"mean":4.9215058950914,"rank":14608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16625,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":8.0629282700422,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
