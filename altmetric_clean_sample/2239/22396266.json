Frequent heat waves favor invasive Phalaris arundinacea over native Carex stricta"],"citation":{"abstract":"Global change in temperature and soil nitrogen availability could affect plant community composition, potentially giving an advantage to invasive species compared to native species. We addressed how high temperatures affected CO2 assimilation parameters for invasive Phalaris arundinacea and a sedge, Carex stricta, it displaces, in natural and controlled environments.\nPhotosynthetic parameters were measured in a wetland in Indiana, USA during the abnormally warm year of 2012. In a growth chamber, photosynthetic parameters were measured on the plants grown under three levels of nitrogen and exposed to optimum temperatures followed by 2012-like summer conditions and then hot temperatures with an autumn-like photoperiod.\nIn the wetland, C. stricta exhibited signs of midsummer leaf senescence, whereas P. arundinacea maintained CO2 assimilation at ambient pCO2 (Aamb) through mid-October. In the chamber, 2012-like conditions reduced Aamb for both species through reductions in maximum carboxylation (Vcmax) and electron transport (Jmax) without further change during subsequent hot, autumn-like conditions, whereas the quantum efficiency of carbon assimilation (qe) declined throughout the experiment. However, P. arundinacea had higher values of Aamb, Jmax, and qe than C. stricta. A general, the positive effect of increasing nitrogen availability occurred for photosynthetic processes for both species in hot conditions.\nOur data suggest that C. stricta is more susceptible to excessive light stress than P. arundinacea during hot, sunny periods, leading to leaf senescence. Field confirmation of this idea is needed, but frequent heat waves should favor P. arundinacea over C. stricta with or without eutrophication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ee","authors":["Elizabeth F.
