In the oxidized state, self-assembly is induced by iterative association of individual porphyrin-based tectons. Dissociation of the self-assembled species is actuated upon changing the redox state of the bipyridium units involved in the tectons from their dicationic state to their radical cation state, the driving force of the disassembling process being the formation of an intramolecularly locked conformation partly stabilized by \u03c0-dimerization of both viologen cation radicals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Christophe Kahlfuss"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b09311","first_seen_on":"2016-11-15T21:16:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126","0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1479244567,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.6b09311"],"pmid":"27766847","pubdate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Electron-Triggered Metamorphism in Porphyrin-Based Self-Assembled Coordination Polymers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electrontriggered-metamorphism-porphyrinbased-selfassembled-coordination-polymers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695823,"mean":6.6062009433119,"rank":6657713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695823,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227339,"mean":12.872795546719,"rank":184142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227339,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18329,"mean":5.0653892405063,"rank":16260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18329,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":413,"mean":6.8445922330097,"rank":359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":413,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
