Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are highly oxidant, biologically active compounds that accumulate in tissues in association with hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and oxidative stress. This is a cross-sectional case-control study involving 80 patients with mild\/severe psoriasis and 80 controls matched for age, sex and body mass index (40 with severe eczema, 40 healthy individuals). Patients and healthy individuals with a smoking habit, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension or who were under systemic treatment were excluded from the study. Skin AGEs were measured in normal-appearing skin by a standard fluorescence technique, and blood AGEs (total AGEs, pentosidine and AGEs receptor) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of cutaneous AGEs (p\u2009<\u20090.04), serum AGEs (p\u2009<\u20090.03) and pentosidine (p\u2009<\u20090.05) were higher in patients with severe psoriasis. Cutaneous AGEs correlated well with serum AGEs (r\u2009=\u20090.93, p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (r\u2009=\u20090.91, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Receptor levels were lower (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in severe psoriasis, and inversely correlated with disease severity (r\u2009=\u2009-0.71, p\u2009< 0.0002). Patients with severe psoriasis have accumulation of skin and serum AGEs, independent of associated metabolic disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000214b","authors":["A Papagrigoraki","M Del Giglio","C Cosma","M Maurelli","G Girolomoni","A Lapolla"],"doi":"10.2340\/00015555-2661","first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T06:37:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0001-5555"],"journal":"Acta Dermato-Venereologica","last_mentioned_on":1493986922,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2340\/00015555-2661","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28358411","https:\/\/www.medicaljournals.se\/acta\/content\/html\/10.2340\/00015555-2661"],"pmid":"28358411","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology","sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"Advanced Glycation End Products are Increased in the Skin and Blood of Patients with Severe Psoriasis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/advanced-glycation-end-products-increased-skin-blood-patients-severe-psoriasis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":2.35,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":1960859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6179753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239838,"mean":13.063590471862,"rank":78437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":160329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239838,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":575,"mean":2.9669337979094,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":575,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1,"SE":1,"AR":1}}},"posts":{"peer_reviews":[{"title":"Advanced Glycation End Products are Increased in the Skin and Blood of Patients with Severe Psoriasis","url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/publon\/review\/3AUhcvhR\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[18476629],"posted_on":"2016-04-08T00:00:00+00:00","summary":"This is a cross-sectional case-control study to evaluate advanced glycation end products (AGEs) levels in patients with psoriasis compared to patients with eczema and healthy controls.
