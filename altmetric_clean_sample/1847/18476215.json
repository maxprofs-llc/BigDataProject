However, previous studies were conducted predominantly with healthy, young, and middle-aged men. We explored the perceived medical barriers to help-seeking in older men with prostate cancer.\nTwenty men with prostate cancer took part in semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using thematic analysis.\nThree themes were identified related to negative attitudes towards help-seeking: male gender role; fear of the health condition, medical and treatment procedures; and embarrassment as a consequence of medical examinations, communication with health (and non-health) professionals, and the disclosure of sexual-related symptoms.\nThe barriers identified in our study strengthen the evidence for the impact of the traditional masculine on help-seeking in men.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100014b6","authors":["L.
