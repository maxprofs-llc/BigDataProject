While the biochemistry of energy substrates such as glucose, fatty acids, and ketone bodies in the liver is well understood, many aspects of the overall control system for hepatic metabolism remain largely unknown. These include mechanisms underlying the ascertainment of its energy metabolism status by the liver, and the way in which this information is used to communicate and function together with adipose tissues and other organs involved in energy metabolism.This review article summarizes hepatic control of energy metabolism via the autonomic nervous system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccd1","authors":["Naoya Yahagi"],"doi":"10.5551\/jat.rv16002","first_seen_on":"2016-10-06T09:33:18+00:00","issns":["1880-3873"],"journal":"Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis","last_mentioned_on":1475644131,"links":["https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jat\/advpub\/0\/advpub_RV16002\/_pdf"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jat\/advpub\/0\/advpub_RV16002\/_pdf","pmid":"27592630","pubdate":"2016-09-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Japan Atherosclerosis Society","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Hepatic Control of Energy Metabolism via the Autonomic Nervous System","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatic-control-energy-metabolism-via-autonomic-nervous-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7577607,"mean":6.5346124353746,"rank":5734969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1015952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7577607,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241796,"mean":12.490503724229,"rank":169130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241796,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228,"mean":2.0650660792952,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"International College of Applied Kinesiology-U.S.A.
