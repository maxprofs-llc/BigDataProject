A systematic search of three electronic databases was carried out and, after the application of eligibility criteria, 21 articles were assessed for quality prior to data extraction. Numerous psychological factors were found to be associated with self-management; however, correlations were typically small to moderate. The strongest associations were found between social anxiety and diet (among males); greater intrinsic motivation, conscientiousness and diet; and extraversion and exercise.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd2","authors":["Kelly Martinez","Sharon F Frazer","Martin Dempster","Andrea Hamill","Hanora Fleming","Noleen K McCorry","Martinez, Kelly","Frazer, Sharon F","Dempster, Martin","Hamill, Andrea","Fleming, Hanora","McCorry, Noleen K"],"doi":"10.1177\/1359105316669580","first_seen_on":"2016-10-06T12:03:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1461-7277","1359-1053"],"journal":"Journal of Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1477907194,"links":["http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/22\/1359105316669580.abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/1359105316669580","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/cgi\/content\/long\/1359105316669580v1","http:\/\/m.hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/22\/1359105316669580"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/09\/22\/1359105316669580.full.pdf","pmid":"27663288","pubdate":"2016-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Psychological factors associated with diabetes self-management among adolescents with Type 1 diabetes: A systematic review","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychological-factors-associated-diabetes-selfmanagement-among-adolescents-type-1-diabetes-systemati-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12,"score_history":{"1y":12,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8194142,"mean":6.9277108590086,"rank":687818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7493561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8194142,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249625,"mean":12.765645082203,"rank":34131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":215291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249625,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1315,"mean":7.603701674277,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":1174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1315,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":11.434844444444,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
