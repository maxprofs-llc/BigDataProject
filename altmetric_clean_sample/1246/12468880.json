Thus, clinical presentation phenotypes with insomnia symptoms were dominant with 53.5%, but only 5.6% had physician diagnosed insomnia. Cardiovascular comorbidity was less prevalent in the EDS and most common in the insomnia phenotype (48.9% vs. 56.8%, p<0.001) despite more severe OSA in the EDS group (AHI 35.0\u00b125.5\/h vs. 27.9\u00b122.5\/h, p<0.001, respectively). Psychiatric comorbidity was associated with insomnia like OSA phenotypes independent of age, gender and body mass index (HR 1.5 (1.188-1.905), p<0.001). The EDS phenotype tended to associate with higher CPAP usage (22.7 min\/d, p = 0.069) when controlled for age, gender, BMI and sleep apnoea severity.\nPhenotypes with insomnia symptoms comprised more than half of OSA patients and were more frequently linked with comorbidity than those with EDS, despite less severe OSA. CPAP usage was slightly higher in phenotypes with EDS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Tarja Saaresranta","Jan Hedner","Maria R. Bonsignore","Renata L. Riha","Walter T.
