Heart failure is a clinical syndrome that evolves from either functional or structural changes to the ventricles that lead to filling or ejection abnormalities. Thus far, pharmacotherapy has been show to be beneficial in patients only with reduced ejection fraction; however, new therapies have been developed in hopes of reducing the burden of heart failure. In this review, we will discuss current pharmacotherapies recommended in American College of Cardiology\/American Heart Association guidelines, the evidence behind these recommendations as well as new and emerging therapies that have been developed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003370","authors":["Leah Raj","Bhavin Adhyaru"],"doi":"10.1136\/postgradmedj-2016-134378","endpage":"734","first_seen_on":"2016-10-06T14:52:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-0756"],"issue":"1094","journal":"Postgraduate Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1481383706,"links":["http:\/\/pmjbeta.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/04\/postgradmedj-2016-134378","http:\/\/pmjbeta.bmj.com\/content\/92\/1094\/726"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pmjbeta.bmj.com\/content\/postgradmedj\/early\/2016\/10\/04\/postgradmedj-2016-134378.full.pdf","pmid":"27708003","pubdate":"2016-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"postgradmedj-2016-134378","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"An evidence-based review of recent advances in therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidencebased-review-recent-advances-therapy-heart-failure-reduced-ejection-fraction-hfref"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7871308,"mean":6.6666994406334,"rank":3660070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4035178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7871308,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245804,"mean":12.554343584089,"rank":114975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":123442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245804,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1441,"mean":7.7924583333333,"rank":896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1441,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":5.7134615384615,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
