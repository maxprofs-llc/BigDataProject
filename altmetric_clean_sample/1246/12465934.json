Advances in healthcare have doubled the life-expectancy of patients over the past three decades. To date, there is no comprehensive review that consolidates economic considerations and care for Marfan patients.\nPresent research suggests that there may be a link between treatment pattern, disease progression and economic costs of Marfan syndrome. It indicates that an early detection of the disease and preventive interventions achieve a dual aim. From a patient perspective, it may reduce the amount of emergency surgery or intervention, and inpatient stays. In addition, it slows disease progression, lowers lifestyle restrictions, reduces psychological stress, and improves health-related quality of life. Expert commentary: Early detection and preventive measures are likely to achieve a dual aim by simultaneously containing costs and reducing the number and length of inpatient stays.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d8","authors":["Carl Rudolf Blankart"],"doi":"10.1080\/14737167.2016.1240619","first_seen_on":"2016-10-06T10:08:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-8379","1473-7167"],"journal":"Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research","last_mentioned_on":1478262140,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14737167.2016.1240619?ai=1plef&mi=ianpxd&af=R","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/bBpS6z8dcQ4f6qiQbCVW\/full"],"pmid":"27662508","pubdate":"2016-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Economic and care considerations of Marfan syndrome","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/economic-care-considerations-marfan-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":3.45,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":1752254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5883328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243386,"mean":12.501705930932,"rank":77153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":165623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243386,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":459,"mean":2.1490524017467,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":459,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.946875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"DE":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CEStezhka\/statuses\/783972110469181440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12465934],"posted_on":"2016-10-06T10:08:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Tanya - ERP&OR","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/ierp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585788897323520000\/MwmgjKlF_normal.png","description":"Managing Editor, Expert Reviews, Journal of Medical Economics.
