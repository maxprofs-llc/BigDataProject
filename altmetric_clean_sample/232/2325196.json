The combination of knowledge, self-efficacy, and engagement has been termed activation. Our objective was to assess the relationship between patient activation and outpatient use of a patient portal. Research design: Survey. Methods and procedures: A telephone survey was conducted with 180 patients who had been given access to a portal, 113 of whom used it and 67 of whom did not. The validated patient activation measure (PAM) was administered along with questions about demographics and behaviors. Results: Portal users were no different from nonusers in patient activation. Portal users did have higher education level and more frequent Internet use, and were more likely to have precisely 2 prescription medications than to have more or fewer. Conclusion: Patients who chose to use an electronic patient portal were not more highly activated than nonusers, although they were more educated and more likely to be Internet users.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003da6","authors":["Jessica S Ancker","Snezana N Osorio","Adam Cheriff","Curtis L Cole","Michael Silver","Rainu Kaushal"],"doi":"10.3109\/17538157.2014.908200","first_seen_on":"2014-05-04T19:51:01+00:00","issns":["1753-8165"],"journal":"Informatics for Health & Social Care","last_mentioned_on":1430246432,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24786648","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24786648?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/17538157.2014.908200"],"pmid":"24786648","pubdate":"2014-04-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Patient activation and use of an electronic patient portal.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patient-activation-electronic-patient-portal-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032449,"mean":5.9702691497267,"rank":2306552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2599124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032449,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126122,"mean":7.8524087344694,"rank":51004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":71225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126122,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":2.062,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Ph.
