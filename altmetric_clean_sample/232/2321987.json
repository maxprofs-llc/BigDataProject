Application of this model to our in-house library has led us to a new scaffold capable of interrupting protein-protein interactions. A synthetic library based on this and related scaffolds resulted in new classes of compounds that possess biochemical and cellular activity and good pharmacokinetic properties. We assume that such general approach to PPI inhibitors design may be useful for the development of inhibitors of various PPI types, including Bcl\/XL.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e1","authors":["Vasilevich, Natalya I.","Afanasyev, Ilya I.","Kovalskiy, Dmitry A.","Genis, Dmitry V.","Kochubey, Valery S."],"doi":"10.1111\/cbdd.12351","endpage":"592","first_seen_on":"2014-05-02T16:41:26+00:00","issns":["1747-0285","1747-0277"],"issue":"5","journal":"Chemical Biology & Drug Design","last_mentioned_on":1399048879,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cbdd.12351\/abstract;jsessionid=01564C7F7077B6566F42D29CF0B7975B.f03t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cbdd.12351\/pdf","pmid":"24797588","pubdate":"2014-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"585","subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"A re\u2010examination of the MDM2\/p53 interaction leads to revised design criteria for novel inhibitors","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reexamination-mdm2p53-interaction-leads-revised-design-criteria-novel-inhibitors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6306418,"mean":5.9759110537734,"rank":4659669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6306418,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143240,"mean":7.7710717192945,"rank":94980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":26574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143240,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":580,"mean":1.8190880829016,"rank":248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":580,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":0.66969696969697,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
