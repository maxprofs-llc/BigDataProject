[Subjects] Thirty-three healthy adults participated in this study. [Methods] Subjects were randomly assigned to either an open kinetic chain exercise group (n=17) or a closed kinetic chain exercise group (n=16). Both the open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain exercise groups performed 3 sets of exercises 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Dynamic balance was measured at the beginning and end of the 6-week training period, including anterior-posterior, medial-lateral, and total displacement of the center of pressure. [Results] Both exercise groups showed improvement in balance parameters but the improvement was only statistically significant in the closed kinetic chain group. [Conclusion] Closed kinetic chain exercise appears to be more effective at improving of dynamic balance ability than open kinetic chain exercise within a 6-week training period.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a8f","authors":["Yoo Jung Kwon","Soo Jin Park","John Jefferson","Kyoung Kim","Kwon YJ","Park SJ","Jefferson J","Kim K"],"doi":"10.1589\/jpts.25.671","first_seen_on":"2014-05-04T18:47:28+00:00","issns":["0915-5287"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Physical Therapy Science","last_mentioned_on":1469624100,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3805008\/pdf\/jpts-25-671.pdf?utm_content=buffer29924&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jpts\/25\/6\/25_jpts-2012-424\/_pdf","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1589\/jpts.25.671"],"pmid":"24259825","pubdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society of Physical Therapy Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"671","title":"The Effect of Open and Closed Kinetic Chain Exercises on Dynamic Balance Ability of Normal Healthy Adults.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-open-closed-kinetic-chain-exercises-dynamic-balance-ability-normal-healthy-adults-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":1851893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6271224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179508,"mean":7.3693640359432,"rank":41930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":137159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179508,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":927,"mean":3.2881468682505,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":927,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":3.2046875,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
