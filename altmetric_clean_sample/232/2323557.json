[Biomed Res Int. 2014] - PubMed - NCBI"],"citation":{"abstract":"This paper compared the similarities and differences of the two most common types of colorectal cancer metastases. The treatment of liver metastases by surgery combined with systemic chemotherapy was explained. The different natural history of liver metastases as compared to peritoneal metastases and the possibility for prevention of peritoneal metastases were emphasized. Perioperative cancer chemotherapy or second-look surgery must be considered as individualized treatments of selected patients who have small volume peritoneal metastases or who are known to be at risk for subsequent disease progression on peritoneal surfaces. However, the fact that peritoneal metastases, when diagnosed in the follow-up of colorectal cancer patients, can be cured with a combination of cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic perioperative chemotherapy cannot be ignored. Careful follow-up and timely intervention in colorectal cancer patients with progressive disease are a necessary part of the management strategies recommended by the multidisciplinary team. After a critical evaluation of the data currently available, these strategies for prevention and management of colorectal metastases are presented as the author's recommendations for a high standard of care. As more information becomes available, modifications may be necessary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Paul H Sugarbaker"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/782890","first_seen_on":"2014-05-03T12:52:17+00:00","issns":["2314-6141"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1418731036,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24783222?dopt=Abstract&","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24783222?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24783222","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Colorectal Cancer: Prevention and Management of Metastatic Disease.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/colorectal-cancer-prevention-management-metastatic-disease-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4759378,"mean":5.7095406108846,"rank":1968405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2709730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4759378,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115947,"mean":7.9630774670969,"rank":40765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":72802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115947,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.9583111111111,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
