Soils of the Almad\u00e9n mining district, and specifically from the Almadenejos zone, are highly contaminated, with some zones having values above 4,000 \u03bcg Hg g(-1) soil. Although soils have an extremely high concentration of mercury, generally less than 2% is available for plants, as is shown by various soil extractions simulating bioavailability. In plants, Hg concentration increases depending on the content of Hg in soils. In addition, Hg levels in roots are higher than in aerial parts, which is a strategy of plants for protecting their more sensitive aerial parts from the deleterious effects of metal stress. The total content of phytochelatins (PCs) and their complexes are directly related with the amount of mercury in soils. These findings highlight the important role of thiol compounds and their metal complexes in capturing and fixing Hg from soils, giving plants the capacity to deal with the heavy metal toxicity of polluted soils.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Angela Dago","Inmaculada Gonz\u00e1lez","Cristina Ari Ntilde O","Alba Mart\u00ednez-Coronado","Pablo Higueras","Jose Manuel Diaz-Cruz","Miquel Esteban"],"doi":"10.1021\/es405619y","first_seen_on":"2014-05-06T10:29:34+00:00","issns":["1520-5851"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1399372125,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24793970?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24793970","pubdate":"2014-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Evaluation of mercury stress in plants from the Almad\u00e9n mining district by analysis of phytochelatins and their Hg complexes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-mercury-stress-plants-almadn-mining-district-analysis-phytochelatins-hg-complexes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3568423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107876,"mean":7.6988018539979,"rank":84152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107876,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4705,"mean":8.4353677721089,"rank":4105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4705,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":9.73978,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
