(Sciaenidae); P. macrochiri sp. n. from the sensory fin of P. macrochir; P. zabidii sp. n. from the ovary of the ninespine batfish Zabidius novemaculatus (McCulloch) (Ephippidae); Philometra sp. 1 and Philometra sp. 2 from the ovary of the Spanish flag snapper Lutjanus carponotatus (Richardson) (Lutjanidae) and the silver grunt Pomadasys argenteus (Forssk\u00e5l) (Haemulidae), respectively; Philometroides eleutheronemae Moravec et Manoharan, 2013 from the ovary of the fourfinger threadfin Eleutheronema tetradactylum (Shaw) (Polynemidae); and Spirophilometra endangae Dewi et Palm, 2013 from the pectoral fins of E. coioides. The new species P. australiensis is characterized mainly by the structure of the cephalic end, 14 minute cephalic papillae, absence of caudal projections and body length of gravid female (67 mm), P. macrochiri by the presence of a conspicuously large anterior oesophageal bulb, 14 very small cephalic papillae and the truncated posterior end of body without any caudal projections, whereas P. zabidii is characterized by the presence of distinct caudal projections, the number (14) and larger size and arrangement of cephalic papillae, a poorly developed anterior oesophageal inflation, the body length (114 mm) and the host family (Ephippidae). All above-mentioned species were recorded from Australian waters for the first time.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007457","authors":["Moravec F","Diggles BK"],"first_seen_on":"2014-05-06T01:12:33+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Folia Parasitologica","last_mentioned_on":1399338723,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24684052?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24684052","pubdate":"2014-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Philometrid nematodes (Philometridae) from marine fishes off the northern coast of Australia, including three new species.","type":"article","volume":"61"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2299439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1610353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107876,"mean":7.6987365005796,"rank":52865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":38705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107876,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167,"mean":1.6808674698795,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.2916666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/worm_papers\/status\/463486315300798464","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2328338],"posted_on":"2014-05-06T01:12:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Helminth papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/442964093498949632\/nwlIaKzr_normal.jpeg","description":"Automated paper feed twitter bot for academics interested in parasitic worms, gut parasites and anthelminthics","id_on_source":"worm_papers","tweeter_id":"2381877092","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":324},"tweet_id":"463486315300798464"}]}}
