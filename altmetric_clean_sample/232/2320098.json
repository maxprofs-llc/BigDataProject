We read through a lot of studies inquiring into hospitals' medication safety. Then, we selected the studies which brought reliable findings and formulated credible conclusions. Finally, we addressed reputable Czech experts in health care and asked them structured questions whether the studies' findings and conclusions corresponded with our respondents' own experience in the Czech hospital clinical practice and what their own estimates of adverse drug events' consequences were like. Based on the reputable Czech health care expert opinions\/estimates, the rate of a false drug administration may exceed 5%, and over 7% of those cause serious health complications to Czech hospital inpatients. Measured by an average length of stay (ALOS), the Czech inpatients, harmed by a false drug administration, stay in hospital for more than 2.6\u2009days longer than necessary. Any positive changes to a currently used, traditional, ways of drug dispensing and administration, along with computerisation, automation, electronic traceability, validation, or verification, must well pay off. Referring to the above results, it seems to be wise to follow the EU priorities in health and health care improvements. Thus, a right usage of the financial means provided by the EC-in terms of its new health programmes for the period 2014-2020 (e.g. Horizon 2020)-has a good chance of a good result in doing the right things right, at the right time and in the right way. All citizens of the EU may benefit using the best practice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b1a","doi":"10.1186\/1878-5085-5-7","first_seen_on":"2014-05-02T00:36:48+00:00","issns":["1878-5085"],"issue":"1","journal":"The EPMA Journal","last_mentioned_on":1398990995,"links":["http:\/\/www.epmajournal.com\/content\/5\/1\/7\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.epmajournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1878-5085-5-7.pdf","pmid":"24834138","pubdate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","startpage":"7","title":"Personalised, predictive and preventive medication process in hospitals--still rather missing: professional opinion survey on medication safety in Czech hospitals (based on professional opinions of recognised Czech health care experts)","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/personalised-predictive-preventive-medication-process-hospitalsstill-rather-missing-professional-opi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":2285337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1640758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":36},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108152,"mean":7.7790466107575,"rank":52490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":41020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108152,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":2.0336756756757,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.9375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
