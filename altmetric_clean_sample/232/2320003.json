Here we report a direct cytosolic interaction between the DNA-damage sensor Rad50 and the innate immune system adaptor CARD9. Transfection of dendritic cells with dsDNA or infection of dendritic cells with a DNA virus induced the formation of dsDNA-Rad50-CARD9 signaling complexes for activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the generation of pro-IL-1\u03b2. Primary cells conditionally deficient in Rad50 or lacking CARD9 consequently exhibited defective DNA-induced production of IL-1\u03b2, and Card9(-\/-) mice had impaired inflammatory responses after infection with a DNA virus in vivo. Our results define a cytosolic DNA-recognition pathway for inflammation and a physical and functional connection between a conserved DNA-damage sensor and the innate immune response to pathogens.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","authors":["Roth S","Rottach A","Lotz-Havla AS","Laux V","Muschaweckh A","Gersting SW","Muntau AC","Hopfner KP","Jin L","Vanness K","Petrini JH","Drexler I","Leonhardt H","Ruland J"],"doi":"10.1038\/ni.2888","first_seen_on":"2014-05-02T00:08:22+00:00","funders":["niaid","nigms"],"issns":["1529-2908","1529-2916"],"issue":"","journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1399496940,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24777530?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ni.2888","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24777530","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ni\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ni.2888.html"],"pmid":"24777530","pubdate":"2014-04-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.
