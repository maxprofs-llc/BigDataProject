To date, the majority of studies have evaluated language differences between relapsing-remitting (RR) and chronic progressive (CP) clinical courses. Neurologists have distinguished two progressive courses of MS: primary progressive (PP) MS and secondary progressive (SP) MS. Recent evidence suggests that cognitive performance profiles may provide a means of differentiating between the clinical courses of RR, SP, and PPMS. With this in mind, a deviation of language profiles between sub-types is predicted. The purpose of this study is to profile the language abilities of five participants with PPMS. Five participants with PPMS participated in this investigation. The participants were assessed using the Neurosensory Center Comprehensive Examination for Aphasia (NCCEA), the Boston Naming Test (BNT), and the Test of Language Competence-Expanded (TLC-E). Data analysis consisted of (a) comparison of the total scores achieved by the PPMS participants and a group of 26 age-matched controls on the NCCEA, BNT, and TLC-E, and (b) case studies to individually profile the language abilities of the five participants with PPMS. Comparison of the NCCEA, BNT, and TLC-E total scores of the participants with PPMS and the control group did not indicate significant differences between the two groups. Case-by-case analysis revealed deficits in meta-linguistic abilities in two participants. The results provide preliminary evidence to suggest that, although patients with PPMS may have preserved general language abilities, some individuals may present with mild impairments in high-level linguistic abilities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100059b6","authors":["Barwood CH","Murdoch BE"],"doi":"10.3109\/17549507.2013.763291","first_seen_on":"2014-05-04T16:03:19+00:00","issns":["1754-9507"],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1401188661,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23374023","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3109\/17549507.2013.763291"],"pmid":"23374023","pubdate":"2013-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Linguistics","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["speechlanguagepathology"],"title":"Language abilities of patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis: A preliminary group and case investigation.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retraction-notice-language-abilities-patients-primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-preliminary-gro-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3814333,"mean":5.0223966689818,"rank":1907377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1715312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3814333,"percentile":44},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98181,"mean":7.3444590751681,"rank":44026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":48407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98181,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225,"mean":2.9008660714286,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.9875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
