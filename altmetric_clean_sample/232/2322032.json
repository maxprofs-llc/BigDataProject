There is no significant difference between patients with ankylosing spondylitis and patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). The increased intestinal permeability in ankylosing spondylitis is independent of disease activity. These findings suggest that the increased permeability is caused by NSAID treatment and is probably not a primary lesion of small bowel mucosa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002997","authors":["A J Morris","C W Howden","C Robertson","A Duncan","H Torley","R D Sturrock","R I Russell","Morris, A J","Howden, C W","Robertson, C","Duncan, A","Torley, H","Sturrock, R D","Russell, R I"],"doi":"10.1136\/gut.32.12.1470","endpage":"1472","first_seen_on":"2014-05-02T17:12:57+00:00","issns":["0017-5749"],"issue":"12","journal":"Gut","last_mentioned_on":1484926722,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1379244\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1773950"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1379244\/pdf\/gut00593-0052.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1379244","pmid":"1773950","pubdate":"1991-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1470","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Increased intestinal permeability in ankylosing spondylitis--primary lesion or drug effect?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/gut.bmj.com\/cgi\/doi\/10.1136\/gut.32.12.1470","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-intestinal-permeability-ankylosing-spondylitisprimary-lesion-drug-effect"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":3267340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4764022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178524,"mean":7.4306050088787,"rank":55690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":121446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178524,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3120,"mean":8.8361750561077,"rank":1722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3120,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":9.8117171717172,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
