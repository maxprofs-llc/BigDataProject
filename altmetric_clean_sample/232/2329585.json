In this study, the bacteria associated with canine arthritis were identified and mRNA expression levels of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines determined. Of the 40 synovial fluid samples analysed, bacteria were isolated from 12 samples by culture (2 CD, 10 SA) and detected in 4 samples (3 CD, 1 SA) using culture-independent methods. Statistically significant increases in TLR2, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-12 mRNA expression were seen in all disease groups compared to normal controls. All disease groups had decreased mRNA expression of other TLRs compared to normal controls, but this did not reach statistical significance. Synovial fluid cell counts revealed that the highest number and proportion of mononuclear cells and neutrophils were found in the IMA and SA samples, respectively. Age had an effect on the TLR and cytokine mRNA expression profiles: TNF-\u03b1 (p=0.043) and IL-12 (p=0.025) mRNA expression was increased and TLR4 mRNA expression was reduced (p=0.033) in dogs up to 4 years of age compared to older animals. In the 10 SA samples from which bacteria were isolated, statistically significant increases in TLR2, TLR7, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA expression were observed. It is concluded that canine arthritis is associated with increased mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which could in some cases be mediated by bacteria through activation of TLR2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f9","authors":["Riggio MP","Lappin DF","Bennett D","Marcello P.
