In the past decade, there has been an increasing number of data and text mining studies focused on the identification of disease associations (e.g., disease-disease, disease-drug, and disease-gene) in structured and unstructured EHR data. This chapter presents a knowledge discovery framework for mining the EHR for disease knowledge and describes each step for data selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and interpretation\/validation. Topics including natural language processing, standards, and data privacy and security are also discussed in the context of this framework.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Elizabeth S Chen","Indra Neil Sarkar"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-0709-0_15","first_seen_on":"2014-05-03T14:34:08+00:00","issns":["1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1399211220,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24788272","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24788272?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24788272","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer New York","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Appl. in Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Systems Biology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Mining the Electronic Health Record for Disease Knowledge.","type":"article","volume":"1159","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mining-electronic-health-record-disease-knowledge"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":2321846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1552433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108459,"mean":7.6836333511591,"rank":53886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":36520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108459,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3194,"mean":1.3604140306921,"rank":856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":1845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3194,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":1.1963389830508,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
