Participants saw blurred (preserving configural information), scrambled (preserving componential information), and whole faces during fMRI scan, and performed a post-scan face recognition task using blurred or scrambled faces. The fusiform face area (FFA) showed stronger activation to blurred than to scrambled faces, and equivalent responses to blurred and whole faces. The occipital face area (OFA) showed stronger activation to whole than to blurred faces, which elicited similar responses to scrambled faces. Therefore, the FFA may be more tuned to process configural than componential information, whereas the OFA similarly participates in perception of both. Differences in recognizing own- and other-race blurred faces were correlated with differences in FFA activation to those faces, suggesting that configural processing within the FFA may underlie the other-race effect in face recognition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f610001548","authors":["Mintao Zhao","Zhao M","Cheung SH","Wong AC","Rhodes G","Chan EK","Chan WW","Hayward WG","Sing-hang Cheung","Alan C.-N.
