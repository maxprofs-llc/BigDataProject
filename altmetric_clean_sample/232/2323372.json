Treatment includes intravenous steroids but up to 40% of patients do not respond and require emergency colectomy. Mortality following emergency colectomy has fallen, but 10% of patients still die within 3 months of surgery. Infliximab and ciclosporin, both immunosuppressive drugs, offer hope for treating steroid-resistant UC as there is evidence of their short-term effectiveness. As there is little long-term evidence, this pragmatic randomised trial, known as Comparison Of iNfliximab and ciclosporin in STeroid Resistant Ulcerative Colitis: a Trial (CONSTRUCT), aims to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of infliximab and ciclosporin for steroid-resistant UC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Anne C Seagrove","M Fasihul Alam","Laith Alrubaiy","Wai-Yee Cheung","Clare Clement","David Cohen","Michelle Grey","Mike Hilton","Hayley Hutchings","Jayne Morgan","Frances Rapport","Stephen E Roberts","Daphne Russell","Ian Russell","Linzi Thomas","Kymberley Thorne","Alan Watkins","John G Williams","Seagrove AC","Alam MF","Alrubaiy L","Cheung WY","Clement C","Cohen D","Grey M","Hilton M","Hutchings H","Morgan J","Rapport F","Roberts SE","Russell D","Russell I","Thomas L","Thorne K","Watkins A","Williams JG"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2014-005091","endpage":"e005091","first_seen_on":"2014-05-03T10:59:22+00:00","issns":["2044-6055",""],"issue":"4","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1399114724,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24785401?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24785401","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"e005091","title":"Randomised controlled trial.
