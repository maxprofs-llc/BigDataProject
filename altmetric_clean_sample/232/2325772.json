Surgical and conservative interventions are performed to manage its progression via reduction of load on the medial compartment or equivalently its surrogate measure, the external adduction moment. However, some studies have questioned a correlation between the medial load and adduction moment. Using a musculoskeletal model of the lower extremity driven by kinematics-kinetics of asymptomatic subjects at gait midstance, we aim here to quantify the relative effects of changes in the knee adduction angle versus changes in the adduction moment on the joint response and medial\/lateral load partitioning. The reference adduction rotation of 1.6\u00b0 is altered by \u00b11.5\u00b0 to 3.1\u00b0 and 0.1\u00b0 or the knee reference adduction moment of 17Nm is varied by \u00b150% to 25.5Nm and 8.5Nm. Quadriceps, hamstrings and tibiofemoral contact forces substantially increased as adduction angle dropped and diminished as it increased. The medial\/lateral ratio of contact forces slightly altered by changes in the adduction moment but a larger adduction rotation hugely increased this ratio from 8.8 to a 90 while in contrast a smaller adduction rotation yielded a more uniform distribution. If the aim in an intervention is to diminish the medial contact force and medial\/lateral load ratio, a drop of 1.5\u00b0 in adduction angle is much more effective (causing respectively 12% and 80% decreases) than a reduction of 50% in the adduction moment (causing respectively 4% and 13% decreases). Substantial role of changes in adduction angle is due to the associated alterations in joint nonlinear passive resistance. These findings explain the poor correlation between knee adduction moment and tibiofemoral compartment loading during gait suggesting that the internal load partitioning is dictated by the joint adduction angle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002ccf","authors":["Adouni, M.","Shirazi-Adl, A."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiomech.2014.02.028","first_seen_on":"2014-05-05T03:34:18+00:00","issns":["0021-9290"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Biomechanics","last_mentioned_on":1399260843,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021929014001390"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbiomech.com\/article\/S0021-9290(14)00139-0\/pdf","pmid":"24636718","pubdate":"2014-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1696","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Partitioning of knee joint internal forces in gait is dictated by the knee adduction angle and not by the knee adduction moment","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/partitioning-knee-joint-internal-forces-gait-dictated-knee-adduction-angle-not-knee-adduction-moment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":3099668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":972786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108142,"mean":7.6647450458199,"rank":74860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108142,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":833,"mean":2.3467139423077,"rank":493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":833,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.84,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
