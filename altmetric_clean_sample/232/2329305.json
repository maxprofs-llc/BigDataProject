In fact, the worldwide sales of single-enantiomer drugs have exceeded US $150 billion. Among them the contribution rate of biocatalysis technology is ever increasing (up to 15-20%). This chapter will focus on the biocatalytic synthesis of chiral compounds useful for pharmaceutical industry. Diverse enzymes, such as oxidoreductases, epoxide hydrolases, nitrilases\/nitrile hydratases and hydroxy nitrile lyases which were isolated from various sources including microorganisms and plants, and the methodology for utilizing these enzymes in enantioselective or asymmetric synthesis will be discussed briefly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009bcbb.book....1Y","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000ccab","authors":["Yu HL","Xu JH","Lu WY","Lin GQ"],"doi":"10.1007\/10_2008_30","first_seen_on":"2014-05-06T10:09:26+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Advances in biochemical engineering biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1399370840,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19623477?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"19623477","pubdate":"2008-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicinal Chemistry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Discovery and utilization of biocatalysts for chiral synthesis: an overview of Chinese scientists' research and development.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/twosided-markets-overview"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3724407,"mean":4.9786083337887,"rank":2981362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3724407,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95110,"mean":7.1509814423451,"rank":75746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95110,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":1.2756483516484,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":22,"Researcher":28,"Student  > Doctoral Student":21,"Student  > Ph.
