To achieve rapid and strong, durable osseointegration, biomaterial researchers have investigated various surface treatment methods for dental subgingival titanium (Ti) implants. This paper focuses on surface-charge modification on the surface of titanium dental implants, which is a relatively new and very promising methodology for improving the implants' osseointegration properties. We give an overview on both theoretical explanations on how surface-charge affects the implants' osseointegration, as well as a potential surface charge modification method using sandblasting. Additionally, we discuss insights on the important factors affecting effectiveness of surface-charge modification methods and point out several interesting directions for future investigations on this topic.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5283cf058f610003e01","authors":["Guo, Cecilia Yan"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/381535","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T21:12:48+00:00","issns":["1687-8787"],"journal":"International Journal of Biomaterials","last_mentioned_on":1403885242,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1155\/2012\/381535","http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ijbm\/2012\/381535\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ijbm\/2012\/381535.pdf","pmid":"23093962","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Effects of Surface Charges on Dental Implants: Past, Present, and Future","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-surface-charges-dental-implants-past-present-future-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4018593,"mean":5.0292510539975,"rank":867913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3122498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4018593,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125298,"mean":8.9740372238541,"rank":35621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":88833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125298,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.61904761904762,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
