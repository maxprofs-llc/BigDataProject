The subjects involved 11 athletes (mean age 43.5 years+\/-11.6, range 22-59) with resistant tendinopathy of the main body of the Achilles tendon for a mean of 51.4 months (+\/-55.56, range 4-144) who failed to improve with an eccentric loading program (mean 11.8 months+\/-2.6, range 8-16). The morphological features, neovascularisation and maximal tendon thickness were assessed with power Doppler ultrasound. Clinical function was measured with the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles tendon (VISA-A) questionnaire. All the tendinopathic Achilles tendons were injected with 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride, 25 mg of hydrocortisone acetate, and 40 mL of 0.9% NaCl saline solution under real time ultrasound guidance. All outcome measures were recorded at baseline and after a short-term follow-up (mean 2.9 weeks, range 2-4). The results showed a statistically significant difference between baseline and 3-week follow-up in all the outcome measures after HVIGI. The grade of neovascularisation reduced (3-1.1, p=0.003), the maximal tendon diameter decreased (8.7-7.6 mm, p<0.001), and the VISA-A scores improved (46.3-84.1, p<0.001). In conclusion, HVIGI for resistant tendinopathy of the main body of the Achilles tendon is effective to improve symptoms, reduce neovascularisation, and decrease maximal tendon thickness at short-term follow-up.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e39","authors":["Humphrey J","Chan O","Crisp T","Padhiar N","Morrissey D","Twycross-Lewis R","King J","Maffulli N","Joel Humphrey","Otto Chan","Tom Crisp","Nat Padhiar","Dylan Morrissey","Richard Twycross-Lewis","John King","Nicola Maffulli"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jsams.2009.09.007","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T19:08:01+00:00","issns":["1440-2440","14402440"],"journal":"Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport","last_mentioned_on":1503237247,"links":["http:\/\/www.jsams.org\/article\/S1440-2440(09)00223-0\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19944642","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19944642"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jsams.org\/article\/S1440244009002230\/pdf","pmid":"19944642","pubdate":"2010-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"The short-term effects of high volume image guided injections in resistant non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shortterm-effects-high-volume-image-guided-injections-resistant-noninsertional-achilles-tendinopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0.85,"6m":0.85,"3m":0.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":3778412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4532655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242191,"mean":8.3007150088774,"rank":94463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":144591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242191,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1332,"mean":10.77950864012,"rank":841,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1332,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":18.616530612245,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
