Although numerous cases of LP resolve spontaneously, many cases require systemic treatment. Several therapeutic advances have occurred in the last 10 years: acitretin (30 mg daily for 8 weeks) remains a first-line therapy (level B, controlled clinical trial >20 participants); systemic corticosteroids are second-line therapies (level C, clinical trial <20 participants, or larger trial without appropriate controls); and new data recommend against the use of tetracycline (level C). This article reviews the current status of systemic therapies for cutaneous LP.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007090","authors":["Asch S","Goldenberg G"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T17:14:05+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Cutis","last_mentioned_on":1375581448,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21488570"],"pmid":"21488570","pubdate":"2011-04-14T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Systemic treatment of cutaneous lichen planus: an update.","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systemic-treatment-cutaneous-lichen-planus-update-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4755858,"mean":5.7089565439016,"rank":1152006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3014002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4755858,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168118,"mean":8.6495576651977,"rank":49317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":116594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168118,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180,"mean":2.9536983240223,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
