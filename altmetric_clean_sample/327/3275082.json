Two core subunits of this complex, XCAP-C and XCAP-E, belong to an emerging family of putative ATPases, the SMC family. We report here that 13S condensin has a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity and exhibits a high affinity for structured DNAs such as cruciform DNA. 13S condensin is able to introduce positive supercoils into a closed circular DNA in the presence of bacterial or eukaryotic topoisomerase I. The supercoiling reaction is ATP-dependent. We propose that 13S condensin wraps DNA in a right-handed direction by utilizing the energy of ATP hydrolysis. This reaction may represent a key mechanism underlying the compaction of chromatin fibers during mitosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","authors":["K Kimura","T Hirano"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T19:01:54+00:00","issns":["0092-8674"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1380269208,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9288743"],"pmid":"9288743","pubdate":"1997-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"ATP-dependent positive supercoiling of DNA by 13S condensin: a biochemical implication for chromosome condensation.","type":"article","volume":"90","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atpdependent-positive-supercoiling-dna-13s-condensin-biochemical-implication-chromosome-condensation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633617,"mean":4.9215564192856,"rank":815861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633617,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94848,"mean":8.1272250044811,"rank":24685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94848,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7728,"mean":10.611004788404,"rank":2690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":2533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7728,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":120.06472727273,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":36,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
