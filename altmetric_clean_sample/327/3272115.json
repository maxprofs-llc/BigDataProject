In mice, the corresponding protein, called Endo B, is expressed at the 4- to 8-cell stage of mouse development and may be one of the first intermediate-filament proteins synthesized after fertilization. A cDNA clone for keratin 18, designated pK18, was isolated from a human placental cDNA library by hybridization with the mouse Endo-B probe. It was characterized by hybridization selection of RNA, translation, immunoprecipitation, Northern blotting, and sequence analysis. Synthetic T7 polymerase transcripts of the cDNA were indistinguishable in size from keratin-18 mRNA, suggesting that pK18 represents a full-length copy of the RNA. The cDNA insert is 1,428 nucleotides long and contains a single open reading frame of 1,342 nucleotides coding for 429 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence is 89.7% identical with that of Endo B. The only extensive difference between the two sequences is due to 9 additional amino acids being present in the last half of the N-terminal domain of keratin 18. The 38-nucleotide-long 3' noncoding region of the cDNA is 75% identical with the corresponding portion of Endo B. The 5' noncoding regions are 59% identical. The expression of keratin-18 mRNA was found to vary more than tenfold when HeLa cells and BeWo trophoblastic cells were compared.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007129","authors":["R G Oshima","J L Mill\u00e1n","G Cece\u00f1a"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T17:37:05+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0301-4681"],"issue":"1","journal":"Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1195646365,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2434380"],"pmid":"2434380","pubdate":"1986-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","cellbiology"],"title":"Comparison of mouse and human keratin 18: a component of intermediate filaments expressed prior to implantation.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-mouse-human-keratin-18-component-intermediate-filaments-expressed-prior-implantation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":815925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95046,"mean":8.1302535430587,"rank":24765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95046,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":2.0123742690058,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.0125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
