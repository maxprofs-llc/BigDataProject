A wide spectrum of clinical deformities are encountered and range from simple ring constrictions to major craniofacial and visceral defects. Lower extremity limb malformations are extremely common and consist of asymmetric digital ring constrictions, distal atrophy, congenital intrauterine amputations, acrosyndactyly, lymphedema and clubfoot. Although debated, early amnion rupture with subsequent entanglement of fetal parts (mostly limbs and appendages) by amniotic strands is the primary theory of pathogenesis. The sporadic nature of this congenital anomaly is discussed, as well as a case study involving the surgical correction of an associated rigid clubfoot deformity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a39","authors":["J H Walter","L R Goss","A T Lazzara"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T16:47:30+00:00","issns":["1067-2516"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Foot & Ankle Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1377587916,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9710786","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/s1067-2516(98)80070-7"],"pmid":"9710786","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Amniotic band syndrome","type":"article","volume":"37"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4591036,"mean":5.3874845613204,"rank":1064397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2956332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4591036,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153271,"mean":8.8324593462518,"rank":44605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":106714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153271,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270,"mean":2.164312267658,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.9307692307692,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Amniotic band constriction","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=570363735#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3270367],"posted_on":"2013-08-27T07:18:36+00:00","summary":"Amniotic band constriction (also known as &quot;amniotic band syndrome&quot;, &quot;ADAM complex&quot;, &quot;Amniotic band sequence&quot;, &quot;Congenital constriction bands&quot; and &quot;Pseudoainhum&quot;) is a congenital disorder caused by entrapmen","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=10664129","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"LT910001","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:LT910001"}}]}}
