It is part of the chapter on congenital and acquired brain injury in the Self-Directed Physiatric Education Program for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. In this article, brain injury epidemiology is summarized, and differences in between brain injury in pediatric and elderly persons are highlighted. Underlying physiologic and chemical mechanisms for secondary brain injury are reviewed, along with strategies and research to minimize this injury. Contemporary understanding of the mechanisms and treatments of brain injury in preterm infants is also discussed. Classification of brain injury severity provides a way to stratify this heterogeneous group.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005737","authors":["Brian D Greenwald","Derek M Burnett","Michelle A Miller"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T20:12:46+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0003-9993"],"issue":"3 Suppl 1","journal":"Archives of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1226542089,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12708551"],"pmid":"12708551","pubdate":"2003-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Congenital and acquired brain injury. 1.
