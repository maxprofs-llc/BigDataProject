In clinical setting, the charts of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), USA, are used in Iran. A survey identified significant differences in weight- and height-for-age across provinces, between urban and rural children. Although the percentiles derived from data of the national health survey, in 1990-1992, were substantially below the NCHS charts, the growth patterns were parallel to the NCHS percentiles. In 1997, an anthropometric assessment of male students aged 6-18 years was conducted in Isfahan, a centrally-located city in Iran. The goal of the study was to establish the normograms of heights and weights in Isfahan for use in clinical settings. By a random cluster sample survey, 4,364 of 200,000 male students aged 6-18 years were selected from all areas of the city. Trained health staff measured their heights (cm) and weights (kg), and all the percentiles were calculated. A comparison was made with weight and height data collected from other parts of the country on several occasions. Findings showed that the growth percentiles of 6-18-year male students of Isfahan in 1997 were comparable to the NCHS charts. These students were taller and heavier than their fellow-citizens 22 years earlier, their compatriots in rural areas of Isfahan (1997) and Rasht (1989). They were also taller than those who were living in Tehran (1994). A similar study was conducted at the same time on urban Isfahani female students aged 6-18 years. All the percentiles of their height and weight curves were comparable with those of the NCHS charts. Thus, it is appropriate to use the NCHS charts for school-age children and adolescents in Isfahan city. The cause of improvement in growth parameters in Isfahan should be evaluated in future studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd4","authors":["Ashraf Aminorroaya","Masoud Amini","Habib Naghdi","Akbar Hasan Zadeh"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T17:18:09+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1606-0997"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Health, Population, & Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1222294134,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15038589"],"pmid":"15038589","pubdate":"2003-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Demography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Growth charts of heights and weights of male children and adolescents of Isfahan, Iran.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/growth-charts-heights-weights-male-children-adolescents-isfahan-iran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628563,"mean":4.9406420973419,"rank":816994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628563,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94164,"mean":8.0530054904794,"rank":24385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94164,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":2.260427480916,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Assistant Professor":1,"Researcher (at an Academic Institution)":1,"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine":2,"Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"IR":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Human height","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=240764411#altmetric_citation_31","license":"public","citation_ids":[3271417],"posted_on":"2008-09-24T22:08:54+00:00","summary":"Human height or stature is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human body, standing erect.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=905957","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"RDBrown","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:RDBrown"}}]}}
