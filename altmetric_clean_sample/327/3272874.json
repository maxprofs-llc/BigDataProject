Phlogiston was identified with a material substance, inflammable air. In this paper, I explore the nature of Kirwan's theory, its success in the mid-1780's, the unprecedented collective attack on Kirwan's Essay on Phlogiston by Lavoisier and his colleagues, and Kirwan's ultimate abandonment of phlogistic explanation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4dc3cf058f610001959","authors":["Seymour Mauskopf","Mauskopf, Seymour","Seymour Mauskop"],"doi":"10.1179\/amb.2002.49.3.185","endpage":"205","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T17:58:57+00:00","issns":["0002-6980","1745-8234"],"issue":"3","journal":"AMBIX","last_mentioned_on":1268942719,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12833914"],"pmid":"12833914","pubdate":"2002-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"185","subjects":["chemistry","historyofmedicine"],"title":"Richard Kirwan's phlogiston theory: its success and fate.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1179\/amb.2002.49.3.185","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/richard-kirwans-phlogiston-theory-success-fate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628077,"mean":4.9442940120368,"rank":817296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628077,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94064,"mean":8.0460395267003,"rank":24348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94064,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.85625,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":4.875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Philosophy":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Richard Kirwan","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=350653984#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3272874],"posted_on":"2010-03-18T20:05:19+00:00","summary":"Richard Kirwan FRS MRIA (1 August 1733 \u2013 22 June 1812) was an Irish scientist.
