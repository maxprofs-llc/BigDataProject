TCS comprises conductive hearing loss, hypoplasia of the mandible and maxilla, downward sloping palpebral fissures and cleft palate. Although, there is usually a reasonable degree of bilateral symmetry, a high degree of both inter- and intrafamilial variability is characteristic of TCS. The wide variation in the clinical presentation of different patients, together with the fact that more than 60% of cases arise de novo, can complicate the diagnosis of mild cases and genetic counselling. In the current study, we describe how molecular techniques have been used to facilitate pre- and postnatal disease diagnoses in 13 TCS families.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697d","authors":["Dixon, Jill","Ellis, Ian","Bottani, Armand","Temple, Karen","Dixon, Michael James","Dixon J","Ellis I","Bottani A","Temple K","Dixon MJ","Jill Dixon","Ian Ellis","Armand Bottani","Karen Temple","Michael James Dixon"],"doi":"10.1002\/ajmg.a.30010","endpage":"248","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T21:19:55+00:00","issns":["1552-4833","1552-4825","0148-7299","1096-8628"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics.
