The results are understandable if nitrogenase serves as an electron sink and substrates and inhibitors bind at multiple modified sites on reduced nitrogenase. It is suggested that substrates such as acetylene may be reduced by a less completely reduced electron sink than is required for the six-electron transfer necessary to reduce N2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cba","authors":["J M Rivera-Ortiz","R H Burris"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T20:36:25+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1098-5530","0021-9193"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Bacteriology","last_mentioned_on":1252088855,"links":["http:\/\/jb.asm.org\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/123\/2\/537","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1150625","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC235759"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jb.asm.org\/content\/123\/2\/537.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC235759","pmid":"1150625","pubdate":"1975-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"Interactions among substrates and inhibitors of nitrogenase.","type":"article","volume":"123","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interactions-among-substrates-inhibitors-nitrogenase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":815944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94726,"mean":8.1023635787809,"rank":24629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94726,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3030,"mean":2.7090445691647,"rank":404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3030,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.1178571428571,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
