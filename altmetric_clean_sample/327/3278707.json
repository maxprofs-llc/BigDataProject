Each burial was probably occasioned by rapid tectonic subsidence in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 meters. Anomalous sheets of sand atop at least three of the buried lowlands suggest that tsunamis resulted from the same events that caused the subsidence. These events may have been great earthquakes from the subduction zone between the Juan de Fuca and North America plates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1987Sci...236..942A","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["BRIAN F.
