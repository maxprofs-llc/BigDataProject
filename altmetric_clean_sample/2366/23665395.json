Using a minigenome-reporter and virus-like particle (VLP) production assay, we have accessed the potential of Oropouche virus (OROV), Schmallenberg virus (SBV), and other orthobunyaviruses within the Simbu serogroup to reassort. We found that the untranslated region (UTR) in the medium segment is a potential contributing factor for reassortment by the tested viruses. We demonstrate that for promoter activity to occur it was essential that the viral RNA polymerase (L) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were from the same virus, reinforcing the hypothesis that the large and small segments that encode these proteins segregate together during genome reassortment. Our results indicate that, given the right epidemiological setting, reassortment between SBV and OROV would potentially be feasible and could contribute to the emergence of a new Simbu virus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f610004704","authors":["Tilston-Lunel, Natasha","Shi, Xiaohong","Elliott, Richard","Acrani, Gustavo","Natasha Tilston-Lunel","Xiaohong Shi","Richard Elliott","Gustavo Acrani"],"doi":"10.3390\/v9080220","first_seen_on":"2017-08-12T10:01:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1999-4915"],"issue":"8","journal":"Viruses (1999-4915)","last_mentioned_on":1504948449,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28800086?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-4915\/9\/8\/220","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-4915\/9\/8\/220?platform=hootsuite","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/v9080220","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=oropouche+virus"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-4915\/9\/8\/220\/pdf","pmid":"28800086","pubdate":"2017-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"MDPI AG","title":"The Potential for Reassortment between Oropouche and Schmallenberg Orthobunyaviruses","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-reassortment-between-oropouche-schmallenberg-orthobunyaviruses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":4.1,"6m":4.1,"3m":4.1,"1m":1.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389558,"mean":7.0669301492244,"rank":1832011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6546857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389558,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193371,"mean":12.478123018048,"rank":52903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":140037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193371,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1302,"mean":3.5694819369716,"rank":283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1302,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":2.6196344086022,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
