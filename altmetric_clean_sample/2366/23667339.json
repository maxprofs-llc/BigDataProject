One strategy to achieve safe and efficient brain targeting therapy is to design nanocarriers capable of transporting antipsychotic drugs through the BBB (without affecting the normal functions of the barrier) in a defined part of the brain. Here we investigate the interaction of clozapine-loaded polymeric Nano capsules (CLO-NCs) with hCMEC\/D3 (human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells, D3 clone) cells that constitutes an in vitro model of the blood brain barrier (BBB). CLO-NCs (average size of 100nm) were constructed by the technique of sequential adsorption of polyelectrolytes (LbL), using biocompatible polyanion PGA (Poly-l-glutamic acid sodium salt) and polycation PLL (poly L-lysine) on clozapine-loaded nano-emulsion cores. Pegylated external layers were prepared using PGA-g(39)-PEG (PGA grafted by PEG poly(ethylene glycol)). The influence of the physicochemical properties of the CLO-NCs (charge, size, surface modification) on cell viability was determined. Advanced studies of CLO-NCs internalization (including endocytosis and transcytosis experiments) using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and fluorescence spectroscopy are presented. Our results indicate that among the studied NCs, the pegylated clozapine-loaded NCs were the most protected from their uptake by macrophages, and they were the least toxic to hCMEC\/D3 cells. They were also the most efficient in the transcytosis experiment, which serves as an indicator of their ability to cross a model BBB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002593","authors":["Sylwia \u0141ukasiewicz","Ewa B\u0142asiak","Krzysztof Szczepanowicz","Krzysztof Guzik","Ma\u0142gorzata Bzowska","Piotr Warszy\u0144ski","Marta Dziedzicka-Wasylewska"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.colsurfb.2017.07.053","first_seen_on":"2017-08-12T10:31:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["09277765","1873-4367"],"journal":"Colloids & Surfaces B: Biointerfaces","last_mentioned_on":1502562691,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28797970?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28797970","pubdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
