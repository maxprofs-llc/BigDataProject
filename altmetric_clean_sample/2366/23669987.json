However, little is known about the relationship of the diastolic BP (DBP) level with vascular outcomes after a stroke.\nA multicenter trial dataset involving 3680 recent (<4 months) non-cardioembolic stroke patients followed for 2 years was analyzed. Subjects were categorized per mean DBP level (mmHg) during follow-up: low-normal (<70), normal (70 to <80), high-normal (80-89) and high (\u226590). Pulse pressure (PP) was prespecified by three categories of <60, 60 to <70, and \u226570 mmHg. Independent associations of mean DBP level with major vascular events (MVEs) and ischaemic stroke were assessed.\nMajor vascular events occurred in 20.7% of the low-normal, 15.1% of the normal, 16.9% of the high-normal and 19.2% of the high DBP groups, whilst stroke occurred in 9.9%, 6.8%, 8.5% and 10.8%, respectively. Compared with the normal DBP group, risk of MVEs was higher in the low-normal DBP group (adjusted hazard ratio 1.33; 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.71). Amongst those with SBP 120 to <140 mmHg, risk of MVEs (1.89; 1.13-3.15) and stroke (2.87; 1.48-5.53) was higher in subjects with PP \u226570 (mean DBP 62.4 \u00b1 3.8) than those with the lowest PP (mean DBP 78.0 \u00b1 5.9) whilst, amongst those with SBP <120 mmHg, PP 60 to <70 (mean DBP 52.7 \u00b1 2.5) was associated with increased risk of stroke (5.85; 1.25-27.5).\nDiastolic BP levels in the low-normal range, particularly accompanied by an increased PP of >60, confer increased risk of MVEs and stroke amongst patients after recent non-cardioembolic stroke.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002840","authors":["Park, J.\u2010H.","Ovbiagele, B.","J.-H.
