We report two cases of nodular lymphoid lesions of the liver with numerous IgG4-positive plasma cells in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Histologically, in both cases, the lesion showed a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with lymphoid follicles and granulomas. Fibrous tissue was scarce and without a storiform pattern. Obliterative phlebitis was not identified. The IgG4+ plasma cell counts were 82 and 76 per high power field, with an IgG4\/IgG ratio of 75 and 64\u00a0%, respectively, which qualifies the lesions according to the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-related disease as \u00ab probable histological feature of IgG4-related disease \u00bb. There were no rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes and plasma cells had a polytypic pattern of kappa and lambda light-chain expression. The non-tumor liver showed primary biliary cirrhosis with destructive cholangitis without IgG4 plasma cells. In both cases, IgG4-related disease was not found in other organs neither at the time of diagnosis nor 3\u00a0years later. Serum IgG4 levels normalized after local ablation of the lesions. It seems unlikely that these lesions are a manifestation of IgG4-related disease. However, because the pathogenesis of both nodular lymphoid lesions and IgG4-related disease remains unclear, further studies are needed to elucidate a potential link between nodular lymphoid lesions of the liver and an increased number of IgG4 plasma cells. More definite conclusions will be possible when the pathogenesis of IgG4-related disease has been clarified.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c7f","authors":["Calvo, Jessica","Carbonell, Nicolas","Scatton, Olivier","Marzac, Christophe","Ganne-Carrie, Nathalie","Wendum, Dominique"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00428-015-1841-5","endpage":"617","first_seen_on":"2016-03-13T07:41:38+00:00","issns":["1432-2307","0945-6317"],"issue":"5","journal":"Virchows Archiv","last_mentioned_on":1457785510,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26358058?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26358058","pubdate":"2015-09-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"613","subjects":["molecularbiology","pathology","cellbiology"],"title":"Hepatic nodular lymphoid lesion with increased IgG4-positive plasma cells associated with primary biliary cirrhosis: a report of two cases","type":"article","volume":"467","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatic-nodular-lymphoid-lesion-increased-igg4positive-plasma-cells-associated-primary-biliary-cirrh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7382271,"mean":6.4142077767366,"rank":6387293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7382271,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277278,"mean":10.864908030597,"rank":234310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277278,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":619,"mean":1.7871618122977,"rank":474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":619,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.5706896551724,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/708629907161485313","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6176562],"posted_on":"2016-03-12T12:25:10+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"708629907161485313"}]}}
