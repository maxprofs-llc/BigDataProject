Additionally, to evaluate factors responsible for visibility of the suprachoroidal layer (SCL) and suprachoroidal space (SCS).\nProspective consecutive case series.\n29 eyes of 29 patients with symptomatic, idiopathic ERM were included. Pars plana vitrectomy with ERM removal and ILM peeling was performed. We examined patients with SS-OCT twice preoperatively (9-12 months and one week before surgery), then postoperatively at 1 week, 6 and 12 months.\nTwelve months after surgery visual acuity improved to 20\/50 (0.48logMAR), statistically significantly higher as compared to one week preoperatively (p<0.001). Preoperative loss of visual acuity was commonly associated with progression of deformation of the plexiform layers, as central retinal thickness (CRT) did not decrease in this period, nor did photoreceptor defects increase. Choroidal thickness decreased 6 months after surgery (p=0.02), remained stable until twelve months postoperatively (p=0.2). The outer choroidoscleral boundary was irregular in 16 eyes preoperatively but only in 4 eyes twelve months past surgery. SCS and SCL were visible in 15 eyes.\nDuring the natural course of idiopathic ERM, deformation of the outer plexiform layer progresses and is associated with decreased visual acuity. Eyes with an initially irregular outer choroidoscleral boundary (CSB) recover visual acuity faster after vitrectomy with ILM peeling for ERM. Three factors are independently associated with the visibility of the SCS: disarrangement of plexiform layers, CRT, and multiple adhesion points between retina and ERM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002205","authors":["Zofia Michalewska","Janusz Michalewski","Katarzyna Ornafel- Sagan","Jerzy Nawrocki","Michalewska, Zofia","Michalewski, Janusz","Ornafel-Sagan, Katarzyna","Nawrocki, Jerzy"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajo.2016.02.003","first_seen_on":"2016-03-14T03:50:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1891","0002-9394"],"journal":"American Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1457971779,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(16)30048-4\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26970574?dopt=Abstract#pubmed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002939416300484\/pdf","pmid":"26970574","pubdate":"2016-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Swept-Source optical coherence tomography correlations between retina and choroid before and after vitrectomy for epiretinal membranes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sweptsource-optical-coherence-tomography-correlations-between-retina-choroid-before-after-vitrectomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7391940,"mean":6.4229753378604,"rank":3524380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3808358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7391940,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276636,"mean":10.879985273013,"rank":135919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":137899,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276636,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2123,"mean":2.4291828463713,"rank":1075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":1035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2123,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":2.1912844036697,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
