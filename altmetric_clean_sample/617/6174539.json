Although individuals coming from a foreign nest are, in most cases, promptly rejected, the degree of aggressiveness towards non nest-mates may be highly variable among species and relies on genetic, chemical and environmental factors. We analyzed intraspecific relationships among neighboring colonies of the dominant Mediterranean acrobat ant Crematogaster scutellaris integrating genetic, chemical and behavioral analyses. Colony structure, parental relationships between nests, cuticular hydrocarbons profiles (CHCs) and aggressive behavior against non nest-mates were studied in 34 nests located in olive tree trunks. Bayesian clustering analysis of allelic variation at nine species-specific microsatellite DNA markers pooled nests into 14 distinct clusters, each representing a single colony, confirming a polydomous arrangement of nests in this species. A marked genetic separation among colonies was also detected, probably due to long distance dispersion of queens and males during nuptial flights. CHCs profiles varied significantly among colonies and between nests of the same colony. No relationship between CHCs profiles and genetic distances was detected. The level of aggressiveness between colonies was inversely related to chemical and spatial distance, suggesting a 'nasty neighbor' effect. Our findings also suggest that CHCs profiles in C. scutellaris may be linked to external environmental factors rather than genetic relationships.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Filippo Frizzi","Claudio Ciofi","Leonardo Dapporto","Chiara Natali","Guido Chelazzi","Stefano Turillazzi","Giacomo Santini","Frizzi, Filippo","Ciofi, Claudio","Dapporto, Leonardo","Natali, Chiara","Chelazzi, Guido","Turillazzi, Stefano","Santini, Giacomo"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0137919","first_seen_on":"2016-03-12T17:50:26+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1457743030,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0137919","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26445245","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4596555"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0137919.PDF","pmid":"26445245","pubdate":"2015-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0137919","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Rules of Aggression: How Genetic, Chemical and Spatial Factors Affect Intercolony Fights in a Dominant Species, the Mediterranean Acrobat Ant Crematogaster scutellaris","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rules-aggression-genetic-chemical-spatial-factors-affect-intercolony-fights-dominant-species-mediter"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7382271,"mean":6.4142077767366,"rank":1767822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4632211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7382271,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278131,"mean":10.852296055801,"rank":87912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":184692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278131,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105720,"mean":10.164713135766,"rank":34403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":68901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105720,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5367,"mean":12.441749906821,"rank":1973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5367,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
