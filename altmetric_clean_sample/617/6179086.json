The way in which a person faces their psychotic disorder (i.e., recovery style) has impact on their recovery. The impact of coping style as a moderator in the course of their illness has not been studied sufficiently in persecutory delusions. In addition, internalised stigma is a common process in psychosis that not only might affect emotional distress, but might also shape recovery style. The goal of this study was to examine the moderator role of recovery style between internalised stigma and emotional distress in people with persecutory delusions.\nAll 50 people with persecutory beliefs were assessed by the Recovery Style Questionnaire, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition, and Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness.\nModeration analysis showed that participants with a sealing-over recovery style had high levels of depression when they experienced internalised stigma and low levels of depression only when internalised stigma was low. However, participants with an integration recovery style presented similar levels of depression regardless of the level of their internalised stigma.\nFindings suggest the moderator role of recovery style between internalised stigma and depression in people with persecutory delusions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f610001643","authors":["Regina Espinosa","Espinosa, Regina","Valiente, Carmen","Rigabert, Alina","Song, Hanna"],"doi":"10.1080\/13546805.2016.1147427","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2016-03-14T04:22:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1464-0619","1354-6805"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cognitive Neuropsychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1457926280,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/13546805.2016.1147427?journalCode=pcnp20"],"pmid":"26924174","pubdate":"2016-02-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Recovery style and stigma in psychosis: the healing power of integrating","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recovery-style-stigma-psychosis-healing-power-integrating"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7391940,"mean":6.4229753378604,"rank":2821884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4545827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7391940,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276636,"mean":10.879965029732,"rank":97250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":178113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276636,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184,"mean":4.2408852459016,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.2545454545455,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
