However, the risk of incident diabetes is not the same among statins. Pitavastatin lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol but also seems to be neutral in terms of risk of incident diabetes. Clinical and experimental evidence shows that pitavastatin increases adiponectin levels and reduces oxidative stress, effects that seem to be implicated in the beneficial effect of the drug on carbohydrate metabolism variables. Pitavastatin is a useful hypolipidemic drug, which is promising for patients with increased diabetes risk or established diabetes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073ce","authors":["Filippatos, T D","Elisaf, M S","T.
