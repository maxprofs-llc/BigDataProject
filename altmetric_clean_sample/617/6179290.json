The endpoint of the study was to assess bleeding risk using the 9-point HAS-BLED score, which was previously validated in cohorts of patients with and without atrial fibrillation. For the purpose of this study, the low (0-1), intermediate (2), and high-risk (\u22653) scores were stratified as low\/intermediate risk (HAS-BLED <3) vs high risk (HAS-BLED \u22653).\nThe mean HAS-BLED score was 2.76\u00b11.16; 64 (56%) patients had a HAS-BLED score \u22653.0. Patients with PAD Rutherford category 5\/6 ischemia had an even higher mean HAS-BLED score (3.20\u00b11.12). Logistic regression analysis revealed aortoiliac or femoropopliteal segment involvement, chronic kidney disease, as well as Rutherford category 5\/6, to be independent risk factors associated with a HAS-BLED score \u22653.\nPatients with PAD, especially those presenting with Rutherford category 5\/6 ischemic symptoms, have high HAS-BLED scores, suggesting increased risk for major bleeding. Prospective clinical validation of the HAS-BLED score in patients with PAD may help with the risk-benefit assessment when prescribing antithrombotic therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a2f","authors":["Baumann, Frederic","Husmann, Marc","Benenati, James F","Katzen, Barry T","Del Conde, Ian","Frederic Baumann","Marc Husmann","James F.
