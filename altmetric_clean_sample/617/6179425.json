Therefore, the main aim of this study is to determine if the effect of glucagon activating \u03b2-catenin signalling leading to increased target gene expression is mediated through cAMP activation of protein kinase A. Primary rat hepatocytes were incubated with insulin, glucagon or epinephrine and a range of inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, Wnt, mitochondrial uncoupler (niclosamide) or PKA inhibitors to dissection out the pathway leading to increased serine 552 phosphorylation on \u03b2-catenin following glucagon exposure. In primary rat hepatocytes, we found that short exposure of glucagon or epinephrine caused a rapid increase in serine 552 phosphorylation on \u03b2-catenin that leads to increased cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression. A range of PI 3-kinase and Wnt inhibitors were unable to block the effect of glucagon phosphorylating \u03b2-catenin. Interestingly, both niclosamide and the PKA inhibitor H89 blocked the glucagon effect on \u03b2-catenin signalling leading to a reduction in the target genes expression. Likewise, niclosamide inhibited cAMP levels and the direct addition of db-cAMP also resulted in serine 552 phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin. We have identified a new pathway via glucagon signalling that leads to increased \u03b2-catenin activity that can be reversed with the antihelminthic drug niclosamide, which has recently shown promise as a potential treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This novel finding could be useful in liver cancer treatment, particularly in the context of T2D with increased \u03b2-catenin activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["Chowdhury, Md Kamrul Hasan","Wu, Lindsay E","Coleman, James L J","Smith, Nicola J","Morris, Margaret J","Shepherd, Peter R","Smith, Greg","Md.
