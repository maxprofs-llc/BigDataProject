In 1853, he reported a series of cases as well as proposed strategies for the management of these complex degloving injuries. Treatment strategies have not varied significantly over the years, and these lesions continue to plague surgeons today with failure rates in excess of 50%. We present 2 case series using barbed suture in the management of these complex injuries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a2c","authors":["Boudreault, David Jean-Guy","Lance, Sam H.","Garcia, Jesus A."],"doi":"10.1097\/sap.0000000000000725","first_seen_on":"2016-03-14T02:17:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-3708","0148-7043"],"journal":"Annals of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1457842210,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Barbed_Suture_as_a_Treatment_Approach_in_Complex.97982.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/9000\/00000\/Barbed_Suture_as_a_Treatment_Approach_in_Complex.97982.pdf","pmid":"26954732","pubdate":"2016-03-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Barbed Suture as a Treatment Approach in Complex Degloving Injuries","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/annalsplasticsurgery\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Barbed_Suture_as_a_Treatment_Approach_in_Complex.97982.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/barbed-suture-treatment-approach-complex-degloving-injuries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7386232,"mean":6.4185596659474,"rank":6391437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7386232,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276558,"mean":10.877979244785,"rank":233896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276558,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2346,"mean":1.3041219616205,"rank":917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2346,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":0.897265625,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnnalsofPlSrgy\/statuses\/708867724567384064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6178938],"posted_on":"2016-03-13T04:10:10+00:00","author":{"name":"APSOnlineJrl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611398882\/APS_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief: William C.
