Fusion of macrophages to form foreign body giant cells (FBGC), a hallmark of the FBR, is the consequence of a multistep mechanism induced by interleukin (IL)-4 that includes the acquisition of a fusion competent state and subsequent cytoskeletal rearrangements. However, the precise mechanism, regulation, and interplay among molecular mediators to generate FBGCs are insufficiently understood. Seeking novel mediators of fusion that might be regulated at the post-transcriptional level, we examined the role of microRNAs (miRs) in this process. A miR microarray was screened and identified miR-223 as a negative regulator of macrophage fusion. In addition, transfection of primary macrophages with a mir-223 mimic attenuated IL-4-induced fusion. Furthermore, miR-223 KO mice and mir-223 deficient cells displayed increased fusion in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro, respectively. Finally, we developed a method for in\u00a0vivo delivery of miR-223 mimic utilizing PLGA nanoparticles, which inhibited FBGC formation in a biomaterial implant model. Our results identify miR-223 as a negative regulator of fusion and demonstrate miR-223 mimic-loaded nanoparticles as a therapeutic inhibitor of macrophage fusion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e8","authors":["Moore, Laura Beth","Sawyer, Andrew J","Saucier-Sawyer, Jennifer","Saltzman, W Mark","Kyriakides, Themis R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biomaterials.2016.02.036","endpage":"135","first_seen_on":"2016-03-13T06:41:58+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms","nhlbi"],"issns":["1878-5905","01429612"],"journal":"Biomaterials","last_mentioned_on":1457784432,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26967647?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26967647","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"127","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Nanoparticle delivery of miR-223 to attenuate macrophage fusion","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanoparticle-delivery-mir223-attenuate-macrophage-fusion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7382271,"mean":6.4142077767366,"rank":5583445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7382271,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277278,"mean":10.864911096124,"rank":194982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277278,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2219,"mean":5.3892921550947,"rank":1428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2219,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":2.6630196078431,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
