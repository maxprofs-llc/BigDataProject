Drug discovery projects generally benefit from a broad range of experimental approaches for screening compound libraries and for the characterization of binding modes of drug candidates. Owing to the difficulties in solubilizing and purifying GPCRs, assay formats had been so far mainly limited to cell-based functional assays and radioligand binding assays. In this report, we utilized fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) to analyze the interaction of detergent-solubilized receptors to various types of GPCR-ligands: endogenous peptides, small molecules, and a large surrogate antagonist represented by a blocking monoclonal antibody. Our work demonstrates the suitability of homogeneous and time-resolved FCCS assay format for a robust, high throughput-determination of receptor-ligand binding affinities and kinetic rate-constants for various therapeutically relevant GPCRs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224b","authors":["Antoine, Thomas","Ott, David","Ebell, Katharina","Hansen, Kerrin","Henry, Luc","Becker, Frank","Hannus, Stefan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ab.2016.02.017","first_seen_on":"2016-03-13T11:32:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-0309","00032697"],"journal":"Analytical Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1467341304,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003269716000877"],"pmid":"26954998","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Homogeneous time-resolved GPCR-ligand binding assay based on fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy","type":"article","volume":"502","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/homogeneous-timeresolved-g-proteincoupled-receptorligand-binding-assay-based-fluorescence-crosscorre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7974292,"mean":6.7330879653071,"rank":3714969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4080866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7974292,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281709,"mean":11.029997046587,"rank":129712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":142121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281709,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1091,"mean":2.4171357798165,"rank":566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1091,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.5636551724138,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
