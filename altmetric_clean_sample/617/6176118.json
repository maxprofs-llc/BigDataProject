Thus, there is demand for novel proteasome inhibitors. Proteasomal degradation requires formation of coiled-coil structure by the N-terminal region of ATPase subunits of the proteasome cap. Here we show that peptides that mimic the N-terminal coiled-coil region of ATPase subunits interfere with proteasome function. These results suggest that coiled-coil peptides represent promising new proteasome inhibitors and that N-terminal coiled-coil regions of ATPase subunits are targets for proteasome inhibition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Inobe, Tomonao","Genmei, Reiko"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2015.10.144","endpage":"150","first_seen_on":"2016-03-13T05:42:20+00:00","issns":["1090-2104","0006291X"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1457801469,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26522225?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26522225","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"143","subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Inhibition of the 26S proteasome by peptide mimics of the coiled-coil region of its ATPase subunits","type":"article","volume":"468","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-26s-proteasome-peptide-mimics-coiledcoil-region-atpase-subunits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7382271,"mean":6.4142077767366,"rank":5583461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":994974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7382271,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277278,"mean":10.864943734965,"rank":194988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277278,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8008,"mean":2.7471699762708,"rank":6313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8008,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260,"mean":2.1686563706564,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
