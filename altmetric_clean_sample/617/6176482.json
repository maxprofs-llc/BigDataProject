To compare two different spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems in regard to full macular thickness (MT) and ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) measures and in regard to structure-function correlation when compared to standard automated perimetry (SAP). Methods. Seventeen primary open angle glaucoma patients and 16 controls (one eye per subject) were enrolled. MT and GCIPL thicknesses were measured by Cirrus and Spectralis OCTs. Octopus Perimeter 101 (G2 protocol) reports sensitivity in mean defect (dB). Differences between measurements were assessed with Student's t-test and Bland Altman. Diagnostic performance was also compared between each parameter calculating the areas under the operator receiver (ROC). Linear models were used to investigate structure-function association between OCT and SAP. Results. Disagreement between OCTs in both MT and GCIPL values was significant. Spectralis values were thicker than Cirrus. Average difference between OCTs was 21.64\u2009\u03bcm (SD 4.5) for MT and 9.8\u2009\u03bcm (SD 5.4) for GCIPL (p < 0.001). Patients differed significantly from controls in both OCTs, in both measurements. MT and GCIPL were negatively associated with MD (p < 0.001). Conclusions. Although OCT values were not interchangeable, both machines differentiated patients from controls with statistical significance. Structure-function analysis results were comparable, when either OCT was compared to SAP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f610004087","authors":["Brandao, Livia M","Ledolter, Anna A","Sch\u00f6tzau, Andreas","Palmowski-Wolfe, Anja M","Brandao, Livia M."],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/8307639","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2016-03-13T06:42:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090-004X","2090-0058"],"journal":"Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1460749328,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26966557?dopt=Abstract#pubmed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26966557?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/joph\/2016\/8307639\/"],"pmid":"26966557","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Comparison of Two Different OCT Systems: Retina Layer Segmentation and Impact on Structure-Function Analysis in Glaucoma","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-two-different-oct-systems-retina-layer-segmentation-impact-structurefunction-analysis-gla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":3454180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3930496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278849,"mean":10.923291671448,"rank":127896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":141259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278849,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":472,"mean":1.7810233545648,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":472,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.99444444444444,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
