PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"To explore the molecular mechanism of moxibustion at stomach meridian acupoints for precancerous lesions of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG).\nFifty male SD rats were randomly divided into a normal group, a model group, a stomach meridian group, a control point group and a vitacoenzyme group, 10 rats in each group. The CAG precancerous lesion model was made in all the groups except the normal group. The rats in the normal group and model group were bundled for 30 min per day; the rats in the stomach meridian group and control point group were bundled and treated with moxibustion at stomach meridian acupoints or control points for 30 min per day; the rats in the vitacoenzyme group were treated with intragastric administration of vitacoenzyme, once per day. All the treatment was given for 20 weeks. The pathological morphological change of gastric mucosa was observed under optical microscope; the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), gastric mucosal proliferatig cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), argyrophilic protein of nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NORs) in gastric mucosal cells were detected by enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA).\nCompared with the normal group, in the model group the gastric mucosal cells showed dysplasia and the expression of EGF, TGF-alpha, PCNA, VEGF, Ag-NORs in gastric mucosa cells in the model group was increased significantly (all P < 0.05). Compared with the model group, the gastric mucosa lesion gradually recovered and the expression of EGF, TGF-alpha, PCNA, VEGF, Ag-NORs in gastric mucosal cells was gradually decreased in the stomach meridian group, control point group and vitacoenzyme group, in which the stomach meridian group had the most significant effects (all P < 0.05).\nMoxibustion at stomach meridian acupoints can obviously decrease the expression of cell proliferative factors in gastric mucosa in rats with CAG precancerous lesions, inhibit the gastric mucosal cell dysplasia, and promote the recovery of gastric mucosa.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd20","authors":["Yang, Zongbao","Wang, Chenguang","Chen, Jiaolong","Wang, Hong","Wang, Yadong","Ma, Fuqiang"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-13T09:08:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0255-2930"],"issue":"12","journal":"Zhongguo zhen jiu Chinese acupuncture moxibustion","last_mentioned_on":1457790175,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26964176?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26964176","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"[Effects of moxibustion on cell proliferative factors in gastric mucosa in rats with precancerous lesions of chronic atrophic gastritis].","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-moxibustion-cell-proliferative-factors-gastric-mucosa-rats-precancerous-lesions-chronic-atro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7382271,"mean":6.4142077767366,"rank":6387301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7382271,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277278,"mean":10.864910735474,"rank":234314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277278,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":336,"mean":1.9665194029851,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":336,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.62222222222222,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
