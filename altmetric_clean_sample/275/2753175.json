One such potential correlate was IL-12p40, a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes Th1 T cell function as part of IL-12p70. LVS-infected IL-12p40 deficient knockout (KO) mice maintain a chronic infection, but IL-12p35 KO mice clear LVS infection; thus the role that IL-12p40 plays in immunity to LVS is independent of the IL-12p70 heterodimer. IL-12p40 can also partner with IL-23p19 to create the heterodimeric cytokine IL-23. Here, we directly tested the role of IL-23 in LVS resistance, and found IL-23 to be largely dispensable for immunity to LVS following intradermal or intranasal infection. IL-23p19 KO splenocytes were fully competent in controlling intramacrophage LVS replication in an in vitro overlay assay. Further, antibody responses in IL-23p19 KO mice were similar to those of normal wild type mice after LVS infection. IL-23p19 KO mice or normal wild type mice that survived primary LVS infection survived maximal doses of LVS secondary challenge. Thus p40 has a novel role in clearance of LVS infection that is unrelated to either IL-12 or IL-23.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sherry L Kurtz","Alicia Y Chou","Klara Kubelkova","Daniel J Cua","Karen L Elkins"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0109898","first_seen_on":"2014-10-09T16:36:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1412849313,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25296161?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25296161","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"IL-23 p19 Knockout Mice Exhibit Minimal Defects in Responses to Primary and Secondary Infection with Francisella tularensis LVS.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/il23-p19-knockout-mice-exhibit-minimal-defects-responses-primary-secondary-infection-francisella-tul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4348929,"mean":4.8990146302829,"rank":3408367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":126615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4348929,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117402,"mean":7.7515881125375,"rank":90354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117402,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77723,"mean":7.9080802604153,"rank":60777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77723,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2588,"mean":12.980683417085,"rank":2182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2588,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
