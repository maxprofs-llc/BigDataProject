We investigated if polymorphisms in the IFIH1, RIG-I, LGP2 and VISA genes influence the risk for multiple sclerosis (MS) in a German case-control cohort comprising 716 patients and 706 controls. Evaluation of 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the four genes did not reveal significant single-SNP associations with MS risk, but two VISA polymorphisms were modestly associated with age of onset. Further, we provide initial evidence for combinatorial effects of polymorphic variants in the RIG-I, LGP2 and IFIH1 genes on MS risk.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e75","authors":["Varzari A","Bruch K","Deyneko IV","Chan A","Epplen JT","Hoffjan S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jneuroim.2014.09.015","first_seen_on":"2014-10-10T07:47:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0165-5728"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","last_mentioned_on":1424314940,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25288302?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25288302?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25288302","pubdate":"2014-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Analysis of polymorphisms in RIG-I-like receptor genes in German multiple sclerosis patients.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-polymorphisms-rigilike-receptor-genes-german-multiple-sclerosis-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4782626,"mean":5.7258040009438,"rank":1979061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2722150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4782626,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130245,"mean":8.6652363256658,"rank":48331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":79246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130245,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":658,"mean":2.7473881278539,"rank":242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":658,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.8297647058824,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
