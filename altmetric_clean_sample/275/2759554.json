Hypersensitivity to visual stimuli can lead to greater hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli, which suggests that the interaction between visual and auditory stimuli may play an important role in the pathogenesis of migraine. However, audiovisual temporal interactions in migraine have not been well studied. Therefore, our aim was to examine auditory and visual interactions in migraine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dcd","doi":"10.1186\/1129-2377-15-44","first_seen_on":"2014-10-10T13:15:03+00:00","issns":["1129-2377"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Headache & Pain","last_mentioned_on":1412784308,"links":["http:\/\/www.thejournalofheadacheandpain.com\/content\/15\/1\/44"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thejournalofheadacheandpain.com\/content\/pdf\/1129-2377-15-44.pdf","pmid":"24961903","pubdate":"2014-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"44","subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology","internalmedicine"],"title":"Elevated audiovisual temporal interaction in patients with migraine without aura","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/elevated-audiovisual-temporal-interaction-patients-migraine-without-aura"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3053484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":934734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121338,"mean":8.236670941263,"rank":77704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":31012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121338,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":345,"mean":3.5305058139535,"rank":248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":345,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":3.6857142857143,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
