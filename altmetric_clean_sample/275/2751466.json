Here, we studied mice expressing human IL-37b isoform (IL-37tg) subjected to skin contact hypersensitivity (CHS) to dinitrofluorobenzene. CHS challenge to the hapten was significantly decreased in IL-37tg mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice (-61%; P < 0.001 at 48 h). Skin dendritic cells (DCs) were present and migrated to lymph nodes after antigen uptake in IL-37tg mice. When hapten-sensitized DCs were adoptively transferred to WT mice, antigen challenge was greatly impaired in mice receiving DCs from IL-37tg mice compared with those receiving DCs from WT mice (-60%; P < 0.01 at 48 h). In DCs isolated from IL-37tg mice, LPS-induced increase of MHC II and costimulatory molecule CD40 was reduced by 51 and 31%, respectively. In these DCs, release of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-12 was reduced whereas IL-10 secretion increased (37%). Consistent with these findings, DCs from IL-37tg mice exhibited a lower ability to stimulate syngeneic and allogeneic naive T cells as well as antigen-specific T cells and displayed enhanced induction of T regulatory (Treg) cells (86%; P < 0.001) in vitro. Histological analysis of CHS skin in mice receiving hapten-sensitized DCs from IL-37tg mice revealed a marked reduction in CD8(+) T cells (-74%) but an increase in Treg cells (2.6-fold). Together, these findings reveal that DCs expressing IL-37 are tolerogenic, thereby impairing activation of effector T-cell responses and inducing Treg cells. IL-37 thus emerges as an inhibitor of adaptive immunity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Yuchun Luo","Xiangna Cai","Sucai Liu","Sen Wang","Claudia A Nold-Petry","Marcel F Nold","Philip Bufler","David Norris","Charles A Dinarello","Mayumi Fujita","Luo Y","Cai X","Liu S","Wang S","Nold-Petry CA","Nold MF","Bufler P","Norris D","Dinarello CA","Fujita M"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1416714111","endpage":"15183","first_seen_on":"2014-10-09T11:54:50+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nci","niams"],"issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"42","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1429987328,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25294929?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/42\/15178.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25294929","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.1416714111","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/42\/15178","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/42\/15178.long"],"pmid":"25294929","pubdate":"2014-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"15178","subjects":["science"],"title":"Suppression of antigen-specific adaptive immunity by IL-37 via induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells","type":"article","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suppression-antigenspecific-adaptive-immunity-il37-via-induction-tolerogenic-dendritic-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":56.966,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":56.966},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6488372,"mean":5.9639628106957,"rank":105671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":6382822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6488372,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165412,"mean":8.2124677560745,"rank":4516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":160896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165412,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40285,"mean":21.203606493893,"rank":3259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":37026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40285,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":913,"mean":43.351421052632,"rank":189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":913,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
