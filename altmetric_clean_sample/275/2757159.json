Comparison of nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic analyses of CMV-209 with the other CMV strains revealed that CMV-209 belonged to CMV subgroup I. However, CMV-209 showed some genetic distance from the CMV strains assigned to subgroup IA or subgroup IB. Infectious full-genome cDNA clones of CMV-209 were generated under the control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Infectivity of the CMV-209 clones was evaluated in Nicotiana benthamiana and various legume species. Our assays revealed that CMV-209 could systemically infect Glycine soja (wild soybean) and Pisum sativum (pea) as well as N. benthamiana, but not the other legume species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Phan MS","Seo JK","Choi HS","Lee SH","Kim KH"],"doi":"10.5423\/ppj.oa.02.2014.0014","first_seen_on":"2014-10-10T05:26:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Plant Pathol J","last_mentioned_on":1412796045,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25288998?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25288998","pubdate":"2014-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Molecular and Biological Characterization of an Isolate of Cucumber mosaic virus from Glycine soja by Generating its Infectious Full-genome cDNA Clones.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-biological-characterization-isolate-cucumber-mosaic-virus-glycine-soja-generating-infectio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
