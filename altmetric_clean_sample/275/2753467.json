Recently, RYR2 exon 3 deletion has been identified in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and\/or CPVT. This study aimed to screen for the RYR2 exon 3 deletion in CPVT probands, characterize its clinical pathology, and confirm the genomic rearrangement.METHODS AND RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 24 CPVT probands. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based conventional genetic analysis did not identify any mutations in coding exons of RYR2 in these probands. They were screened using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). In probands identified with RYR2 exon 3 deletion, the precise location of the deletion was identified by quantitative PCR and direct sequencing methods. We identified two CPVT probands from unrelated families who harboured a large deletion including exon 3. The probands were 9- and 17-year-old girls. Both probands had a history of syncope related to emotional stress or exercise, exhibited bradycardia, and were diagnosed with left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC). We examined 10 family members and identified six more RYR2 exon 3 deletion carriers. In total, there were eight carriers, of which seven were diagnosed with LVNC (87.5%). Two carriers under the age of 4 years remained asymptomatic, although they were diagnosed with LVNC. Using quantitative PCR and direct sequencing, we confirmed that the deletions were 1.1 and 37.7 kb in length.CONCLUSION: RYR2 exon 3 deletion is frequently associated with LVNC. Therefore, detection of the deletion offers a new modality for predicting the prognosis of patients with LVNC with ventricular\/atrial arrhythmias, particularly in children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007321","authors":["Ohno S","Omura M","Kawamura M","Kimura H","Itoh H","Makiyama T","Ushinohama H","Makita N","Horie M"],"doi":"10.1093\/europace\/eut382","first_seen_on":"2014-10-09T17:27:50+00:00","issns":["1099-5129"],"issue":"","journal":"Europace","last_mentioned_on":1412969627,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24394973"],"pmid":"24394973","pubdate":"2014-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physiology","cardiology"],"title":"Exon 3 deletion of RYR2 encoding cardiac ryanodine receptor is associated with left ventricular non-compaction.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exon-3-deletion-ryr2-encoding-cardiac-ryanodine-receptor-associated-left-ventricular-noncompaction-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1865604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2587226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121054,"mean":8.1918370135397,"rank":44327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":75144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121054,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":739,"mean":2.1787696476965,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":739,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.2262711864407,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
