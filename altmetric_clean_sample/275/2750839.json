The techniques of spinal osteotomies have been refined to allow surgeons to perform better corrections with less operative time, more safely, and through a posterior approach alone, making multiple patient positioning changes during surgery a less common occurrence. With these techniques comes a learning curve for the entire surgical team, wherein communication and planning can help minimize major complications and morbidity. This overview will review various techniques used in the correction of severe spinal deformities. Topics reviewed include the role of anterior release, traction, posterior releases, and osteotomies. Indications, techniques, and pitfalls will be reviewed. A clear understanding of the patient's deformity, normal sagittal parameters, spinal anatomy, and the principles of neuromonitoring will help improve surgical planning and patient outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd4","doi":"10.1097\/bpo.0000000000000293","first_seen_on":"2014-10-07T19:41:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0271-6798"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics","last_mentioned_on":1415726203,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/Fulltext\/2014\/10001\/Treatment_of_Severe_Pediatric_Spinal_Deformities.4.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/Abstract\/2014\/10001\/Treatment_of_Severe_Pediatric_Spinal_Deformities.4.aspx","http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/_layouts\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?article=00004&issue=10001&year=2014"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pedorthopaedics\/2014\/10001\/Treatment_of_Severe_Pediatric_Spinal_Deformities.4.pdf","pmid":"25207730","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S1","subjects":["orthopedics","pediatrics"],"title":"Treatment of Severe Pediatric Spinal Deformities","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-severe-pediatric-spinal-deformities-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":1872621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3145667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139014,"mean":8.63641161618,"rank":43927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":94311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139014,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1382,"mean":2.172357711803,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1382,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.7694444444444,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Treatment of Severe Pediatric Spinal Deformities","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/191871777498162\/posts\/861744500510883","license":"public","citation_ids":[2750839],"posted_on":"2014-10-07T19:40:57+00:00","summary":"The management of severe pediatric spinal deformities continues to evolve as advances in spinal instrumentation, surgical techniques, and neuromonitoring occur.
