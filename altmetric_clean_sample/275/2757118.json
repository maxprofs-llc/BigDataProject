We investigated the influence of date of birth on melanoma skin cancer (MSC) and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) incidence.Methods:Enhanced cancer registry data were analysed including 1751 MSC and 15\u2009200 NMSC.Results:People born in February to April showed significantly elevated risks of NMSC compared with those born in summertime.Conclusions:We demonstrated seasonality by date of birth for skin cancer incidence.
