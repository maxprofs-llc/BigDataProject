The reaction is highly regioselective. The formation of C-C bonds occurs between the ortho C-H bonds in aromatic amides and the \u03b2-position of the acyclic \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The reaction is applicable to various acyclic \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, such as acrylic esters, acrylamide, fumarate, maleate, and phenyl vinyl sulfone.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Kaname Shibata"],"doi":"10.1021\/ol502500c","first_seen_on":"2014-10-09T22:56:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1412822225,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ol502500c"],"pmid":"25226267","pubdate":"2014-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Rhodium-Catalyzed Alkylation of C\u2013H Bonds in Aromatic Amides with \u03b1,\u03b2-Unsaturated Esters","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rhodiumcatalyzed-alkylation-ch-bonds-aromatic-amides-unsaturated-esters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505835,"mean":5.1065363657613,"rank":1883440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2567055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505835,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121035,"mean":8.1380484326719,"rank":43946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":75564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121035,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2864,"mean":3.2774816625917,"rank":1283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2864,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":1.8205833333333,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
