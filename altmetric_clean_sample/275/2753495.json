Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed 97% as CD3 positive, confirming a T-cell lineage. Additionally, T-cell subset assessment showed 53.2% to be double-negative T-lymphocytes, expressing neither CD4 nor CD8 surface markers. The number of double-negative lymphocytes in circulation coincided with the number of T-cell receptor (TCR) \u03b3\u03b4-expressing T-cells in circulation. Molecular T-cell clonality analysis of TCR Gamma (TCRG) gene rearrangement showed a polyclonal expansion of T-lymphocytes. Histopathology confirmed the mass to be a thymoma, supporting the diagnosis of thymoma-associated T-cell lymphocytosis. Resolution of the lymphocytosis after removal of the thymoma provided further evidence for this diagnosis. To the authors' knowledge, this case is only the second report of thymoma-associated peripheral lymphocytosis in the veterinary literature, and is the first to report a confirmed thymoma-associated peripheral \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell lymphocytosis in a dog.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c6a","authors":["Burton, Andrew G.","Borjesson, Dori L.","Vernau, William"],"doi":"10.1111\/vcp.12196","endpage":"588","first_seen_on":"2014-10-09T17:33:48+00:00","issns":["1939-165X","0275-6382"],"issue":"4","journal":"Veterinary Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1412847532,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vcp.12196\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vcp.12196\/pdf","pmid":"25295998","pubdate":"2014-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"584","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Thymoma\u2010associated lymphocytosis in a dog","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thymomaassociated-lymphocytosis-dog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6268628,"mean":5.9882245608177,"rank":5329444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6268628,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154406,"mean":8.4039557009166,"rank":122611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154406,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":1.1470821917808,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
