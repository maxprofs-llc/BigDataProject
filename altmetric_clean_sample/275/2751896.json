Here, we investigated the effect of the rubber hand illusion (RHI) on the perceived discomfort caused by cold stimulus applied to the real hand. The results showed reduced discomfort to cold reflected in behavioural and subjective measures. The stronger the illusion, the later the cold temperature became unpleasant and the less intense the experience was rated. We discuss the link between thermoception and body ownership as well as possible theoretical and methodological implications for studies on pain experience under RHI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Marta Siedlecka","Anna Klimza","Marta \u0141ukowska","Micha\u0142 Wierzcho\u0144"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0109909","first_seen_on":"2014-10-09T12:45:51+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1481298789,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0109909#s1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25295527?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0109909#s1","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0109909","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/metrics\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0109909","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4190400\/pdf\/pone.0109909.pdf","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4190400\/pdf\/pone.0109909.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0109909.pdf","pmid":"25295527","pubdate":"2014-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e109909","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Rubber Hand Illusion Reduces Discomfort Caused by Cold Stimulus","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rubber-hand-illusion-reduces-discomfort-caused-cold-stimulus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.35,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7866440,"mean":6.6628832942016,"rank":1205902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6657163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7866440,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196390,"mean":7.7122677543042,"rank":34912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":161331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196390,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110717,"mean":10.310219787565,"rank":23646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":86966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110717,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2895,"mean":16.040567380788,"rank":739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":2153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2895,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":11}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
