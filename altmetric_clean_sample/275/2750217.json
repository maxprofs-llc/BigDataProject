Batch (batch soaking) and continuous flow (quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation) methods were used to evaluate the impact of CNCs on bacterial initial adhesion. This study demonstrated that bacterial initial adhesion to solid surfaces can be significantly hindered by CNCs using both methods. In the presence of CNCs, it was observed that bacteria with more EPS aggregated more significantly compared to bacteria with less EPS, and that bacterial deposition under this condition decreased to a greater extent. The classic DLVO theory failed to predict bacterial adhesion behavior in this study. A detailed discussion is provided regarding potential antibacterial adhesion mechanisms of CNCs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000898b","authors":["Xiaohui Sun","Qingye Lu","Yaman Boluk","Yang Liu"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4sm00946k","first_seen_on":"2014-10-07T15:46:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-6848"],"journal":"Soft Matter","last_mentioned_on":1412696647,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25283690?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25283690","pubdate":"2014-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"title":"The impact of cellulose nanocrystals on the aggregation and initial adhesion of Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-cellulose-nanocrystals-aggregation-initial-adhesion-pseudomonas-fluorescens-bacteria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506116,"mean":5.115759950541,"rank":2325693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1539150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506116,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120747,"mean":8.2042244546404,"rank":58595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":48939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120747,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1480,"mean":1.85830831643,"rank":427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1480,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.4011627906977,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
