Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in AIDS patients worldwide but very little is known about early TB infection or TB\/HIV co-infection in infants. A clinically relevant newborn animal model to study TB infection is urgently needed. We have successfully established an aerosol newborn\/infant model in neonatal nonhuman primates (NHPs) that mimics clinical and bacteriological characteristics of Mtb infection as seen in human newborns\/infants. Further, this model will allow the establishment of a TB coinfection model of pediatric AIDS. Aerosol versus intra broncho-alveolar Mtb infection was studied. Interestingly, 42 days post infection specific lesions were detected suggestive of the classic Ghon focus in human children. Concurrently, specific cellular immune responses developed 4-6 weeks after Mtb infection. Using the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays, we found that IL-12 production correlated with early Mtb infection lesions seen by routine thoracic radiographs. Overall, this work represents the first example of early Mtb infection of newborn macaques. This study gives us a unique opportunity to further characterize immunopathogenesis and establish a TB\/SIV co-infection model for pediatric AIDS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c14","authors":["Cepeda M","Salas M","Folwarczny J","Leandro AC","Hodara VL","de la Garza MA","Dick EJ Jr","Owston M","Armitige LY","Gauduin MC"],"doi":"10.1016\/s1472-9792(13)70011-8","first_seen_on":"2014-10-09T23:56:24+00:00","issns":["1472-9792"],"issue":"","journal":"Tuberculosis (formerly Tubercle and Lung Disease)","last_mentioned_on":1415375643,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24388650","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24388650?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24388650","pubdate":"2014-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Establishment of a neonatal rhesus macaque model to study Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.","type":"article","volume":"93 Suppl","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/establishment-neonatal-rhesus-macaque-model-study-mycobacterium-tuberculosis-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.866,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.866},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4478505,"mean":4.7770715355304,"rank":496351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3982179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4478505,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120619,"mean":7.3564402328011,"rank":17923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":102696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120619,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":2.231702970297,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.38888888888889,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
