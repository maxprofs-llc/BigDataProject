In livers, kidneys, and bones (tarsus), mallards and spot-billed ducks with embedded shot had greater lead concentrations than white-fronted geese and spot-billed ducks without lead shot. Lead concentrations in spot-billed ducks were greater in bones than in livers and kidneys suggesting chronic exposure to lead. Lead concentrations in 8 of 32 livers, 5 of 32 kidneys, and 9 of 32 bones exceeded the threshold level of abnormal exposure for wild birds (>5\u00a0\u00b5g\/g dw in lives, >6\u00a0\u00b5g\/g dw in kidney, and >6.75\u00a0\u00b5g\/g dw in bone). Increased lead concentrations in soft tissues and bones might be attributed to increased lead shot ingestion and embedded shot. Lead concentrations were correlated between livers and kidneys, between livers and bones, and between kidneys and bones. These results suggest that a relationship between acute exposure in livers and kidneys and chronic exposure in bones.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649d","authors":["Jungsoo Kim","Jong-Min Oh"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00244-014-0039-1","first_seen_on":"2014-10-09T18:42:44+00:00","issns":["1432-0703","0090-4341"],"journal":"Archives of Environmental Contamination & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1412880136,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00244-014-0039-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00244-014-0039-1.pdf","pmid":"24854704","pubdate":"2014-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Monitoring\/Analysis","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pollution, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Soil Science & Conservation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Assessment of Lead Exposure in Waterfowl Species, Korea","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-lead-exposure-waterfowl-species-korea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4348929,"mean":4.8990146302829,"rank":3408288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":126616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4348929,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117402,"mean":7.7511749985095,"rank":90326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117402,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":393,"mean":2.8224744897959,"rank":261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":393,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":0.98846153846154,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ecotoxicology\/status\/520283119115829248","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2753914],"posted_on":"2014-10-09T18:42:16+00:00","author":{"name":"ecotoxicology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/499652563751280642\/9Yw-u5dW_normal.png","description":"Ecotoxicology and Environmental Pollution  Publications Feed.
