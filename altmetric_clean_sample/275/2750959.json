An approximate expression involving two adjustable parameters is introduced to estimate k(pr) from molecular structure. As a result, using only a hand-held calculator, ln(h(50)) values are estimated with a good reliability (R(2) \u2243 0.8) compared to previous schemes. These results support the underlying assumption that sensitivity primarily depends on the ability of reacting species to propagate the decomposition before the released energy dissipates away.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Didier Mathieu"],"doi":"10.1021\/jp507057r","first_seen_on":"2014-10-07T20:28:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-5639"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","last_mentioned_on":1412713695,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jp507057r"],"pmid":"25254318","pubdate":"2014-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
