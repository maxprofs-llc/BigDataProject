They are referred to as orphan receptors because the COUP-TF ligands have yet to be identified. Since the discovery of COUP-TFs in 1986, extensive studies have demonstrated their crucial functions in a variety of developmental processes, such as organogenesis, angiogenesis, and metabolic homeostasis. Recently, emerging evidence has highlighted that COUP-TFs, specifically COUP-TFII, play important roles in tumorigenesis. In this review, we will discuss the critical functions of COUP-TFII in the development of the tumor microenvironment, the progression of various cancers, and its underlying mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006861","authors":["Mafei Xu","Jun Qin","Sophia Y Tsai","Ming-jer Tsai"],"doi":"10.1038\/aps.2014.86","first_seen_on":"2014-10-07T18:29:19+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1671-4083","1745-7254"],"journal":"Acta Pharmacologica Sinica","last_mentioned_on":1412614021,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/aps\/rss\/aop\/~3\/goRiAj5NGvM\/aps.2014.86"],"pmid":"25283503","pubdate":"2014-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"The role of the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TFII in tumorigenesis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-orphan-nuclear-receptor-couptfii-tumorigenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4335299,"mean":4.931929451188,"rank":532551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3778465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4335299,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116842,"mean":7.9028930255648,"rank":19490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":96193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116842,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":3.9744128686327,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":6.9375,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
