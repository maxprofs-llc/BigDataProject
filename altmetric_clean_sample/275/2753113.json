Here, we exploit the distinct spatial and temporal localizations of these cells to selectively ablate BMP signaling in each compartment and examine its functional role. We find that BMP signaling is required for HFSC quiescence and to promote TAC differentiation along different lineages as the hair cycle progresses. We also combine in vivo genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep-sequencing, transcriptional profiling, and loss-of-function genetics to define BMP-regulated genes. We show that some pSMAD1\/5 targets, like Gata3, function specifically in TAC lineage-progression. Others, like Id1 and Id3, function in both HFSCs and TACs, but in distinct ways. Our study therefore illustrates the complex differential roles that a key signaling pathway can play in regulation of closely related stem\/progenitor cells within the context of their overall niche.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e1f","doi":"10.1016\/j.stem.2014.09.009","first_seen_on":"2014-10-09T16:24:05+00:00","funders":["niams"],"issns":["1934-5909","19345909","1875-9777"],"journal":"Cell Stem Cell","last_mentioned_on":1437127295,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?code=cell-site&rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell-stem-cell%2Fabstract%2FS1934-5909%252814%252900400-7","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=7&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell-stem-cell%2Fabstract%2FS1934-5909%252814%252900400-7&code=cell-site","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.stem.2014.09.009","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25312496?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25312496","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell-stem-cell%2Fabstract%2FS1934-5909%252814%252900400-7%3Frss%3Dyes&code=cell-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell-stem-cell%2Fabstract%2FS1934-5909%252814%252900400-7&code=cell-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?code=cell-site&rc=7&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell-stem-cell%2Fabstract%2FS1934-5909%252814%252900400-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1934590914004007\/pdf","pmid":"25312496","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"BMP Signaling and Its pSMAD1\/5 Target Genes Differentially Regulate Hair Follicle Stem Cell Lineages","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bmp-signaling-psmad15-target-genes-differentially-regulate-hair-follicle-stem-cell-lineages-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":33.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":33.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6882558,"mean":6.1766853014052,"rank":197396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":6685053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6882558,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191461,"mean":7.5187213308266,"rank":7687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":183770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191461,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1300,"mean":26.60542417244,"rank":218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1300,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":34.387692307692,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
