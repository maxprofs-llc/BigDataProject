Indeed, it is now well established that neutrophils generate a plethora of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are profoundly involved in the onset and evolution of the inflammatory reaction. Several recent studies have also shown that neutrophils can represent an important source of inflammatory cytokines in a number of pathophysiological settings. The inflammatory cytokines produced by neutrophils are generally encoded by immediate-early response genes, which in turn depend on the activation of transcription factors such as those belonging to the nuclear factor-kappa B and signal transducers and activators of transcription families. We have shown in the past that such factors are expressed and inducible in neutrophils stimulated by physiological agonists. However, the detection of intact (i.e., undegraded) transcription factors in neutrophils requires special precautions and an alternative protocol due to the huge amounts of endogenous proteases present in these cells. This protocol is the focus of this chapter.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["McDonald PP","Ye RD"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-62703-845-4_29","first_seen_on":"2014-10-10T11:04:28+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1064-3745"],"issue":"","journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1412938968,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24504970?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24504970","pubdate":"2014-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Detection of intact transcription factors in human neutrophils.","type":"article","volume":"1124","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-intact-transcription-factors-human-neutrophils"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4351319,"mean":4.8921243495113,"rank":3408239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":126789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4351319,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117734,"mean":7.7747196622868,"rank":90534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117734,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2978,"mean":1.4559778300302,"rank":1752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2978,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":1.4540579710145,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/520529877133312000","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2758697],"posted_on":"2014-10-10T11:02:48+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
