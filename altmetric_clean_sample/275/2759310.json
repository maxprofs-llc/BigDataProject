In this study, we aimed to determine whether individual helical fragments of Mistic are sufficient for its interaction with membranes in vivo and in vitro. To this end, fragments encompassing each of Mistic's helical segments and combinations of them were produced as GFP-fusions, and their cellular localization was studied in E. coli. Furthermore, peptides corresponding to the four helical fragments were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis, and their ability to acquire secondary structure in a variety of lipids and detergents was studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Both types of experiments demonstrate that the third helical fragment of Mistic interacts only with LDAO micelles but does not partition into lipid bilayers. Interestingly, the other three helices interact with membranes in vivo and in vitro. Nevertheless, all of these short sequences can replace full-length Mistic as N-terminal fusions to achieve overexpression of a human G-protein-coupled receptor in E. coli, although with different effects on quantity and quality of the protein produced. A bioinformatic analysis of the Mistic family expanded the number of homologs from four to twenty, including proteins outside the genus Bacillus. This information allowed us to discover a highly conserved Shine-Dalgarno sequence in the operon mstX-yugO that is important for downstream translation of the potassium ion channel yugO.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008646","authors":["Jacopo Marino","Natalie Bordag","Sandro Keller","Oliver Zerbe","Marino, Jacopo","Bordag, Natalie","Keller, Sandro","Zerbe, Oliver"],"doi":"10.1002\/pro.2582","endpage":"48","first_seen_on":"2014-10-10T12:34:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1469-896X","0961-8368"],"issue":"1","journal":"Protein Science","last_mentioned_on":1421748790,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25297828?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pro.2582\/abstract#UZH_Science"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pro.2582\/pdf","pmid":"25297828","pubdate":"2014-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Computation Theory And Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"38","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Mistic's membrane association and its assistance in overexpression of a human GPCR are independent processes","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mistics-membrane-association-assistance-overexpression-human-gpcr-independent-processes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6346178,"mean":5.9805673551182,"rank":2335328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3917067,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6346178,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164000,"mean":8.2216379246217,"rank":59347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":101354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164000,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":870,"mean":2.6134384349827,"rank":471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":870,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.0743870967742,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
