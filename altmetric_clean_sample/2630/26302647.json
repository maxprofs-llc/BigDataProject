The answer is that they evolve (behavioral evolution) as species evolve over generations (biological evolution). In biological evolution, under certain conditions, groups of cooperative organisms would be selected over groups of non-cooperative organisms, even when cooperation imposes a cost to individuals. Analogously, in behavioral evolution, patterns of acts may be selected even when each individual act in the pattern is costly. Although there is considerable debate among biologists whether the conditions for group selection are met in biological evolution, it is argued here that they are met in behavioral evolution (as well as in cultural evolution). The article shows how selection of patterns can explain the learning of self-control and altruism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023af","authors":["Howard Rachlin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.beproc.2017.09.005","first_seen_on":"2017-09-19T10:14:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03766357"],"journal":"Behavioural Processes","last_mentioned_on":1506826354,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0376635717302784","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0376635717302784?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor=&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb"],"pmid":"28899811","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Group selection in behavioral evolution","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/group-selection-behavioral-evolution"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":1.35,"1m":1.35,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0.25,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462593,"mean":7.1086032149407,"rank":4210705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4187213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462593,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126138,"mean":11.784526221489,"rank":59688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":65109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126138,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":989,"mean":9.3393744939271,"rank":540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":989,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.24,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
