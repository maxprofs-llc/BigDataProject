Salivary cortisol samples were collected pre- and post-simulation for both trials. Heart rate was measured continuously throughout the study.\nSignificant changes in salivary cortisol (P\u200a=\u200a0.000, \u03b7\u200a=\u200a0.139), average (P\u200a=\u200a0.006, \u03b7\u200a=\u200a0.087), and peak heart rate (P\u200a=\u200a0.013, \u03b7\u200a=\u200a0.077) from pre- to postsimulation were found. Varying task complexity did partially influence stress response; average (P\u200a=\u200a0.016, \u03b7\u200a=\u200a0.026) and peak heart rate (P\u200a=\u200a0.034, \u03b7\u200a=\u200a0.020) were higher in the experimental condition. Trainees also recorded higher average (P\u200a=\u200a0.000, \u03b7\u200a=\u200a0.054) and peak heart rates (P\u200a=\u200a0.027, \u03b7\u200a=\u200a0.022).\nPerforming simulated pilotage tasks evoked a measurable stress response in both trainee and expert maritime pilots.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
