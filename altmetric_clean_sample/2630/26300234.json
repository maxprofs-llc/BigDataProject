These fingerprints are further non-linearly transformed, their inner product is calculated and used to predict the binding potential. Moreover, we show that widely used benchmark datasets may be insufficient for testing structure-based virtual screening methods that utilize machine learning. Therefore, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, which we constructed based on DUD-E, MUV and PDBBind databases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100025f2","authors":["Adam Gonczarek","Jakub M.
