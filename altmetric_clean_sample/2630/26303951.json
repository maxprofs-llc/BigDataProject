The transmissibility and public health significance of some NAAT-identified infections are, however, not known.\nAdults attending an urban emergency department provided specimens for C trachomatis screening using NAAT. Participants testing positive were offered follow-up including re-testing for C trachomatis using NAAT and traditional methods, eg culture and direct fluorescent antibody, and were treated. Partners were offered identical evaluation and treatment. Overall, 90 C trachomatis-positive participants had one or more sexual partners enrolled.\nEvidence of transmission, as defined by infection concordance between partnerships, was observed among 75% of partners of index cases testing positive by both NAAT and traditional assay but only 45% of partners of index cases testing positive by NAAT only (prevalence ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.5). Among index participants returning for follow-up, 17% had no evidence of C trachomatis infection by NAAT or traditional assay (median follow-up three weeks).\nA substantial proportion of positive NAAT results for chlamydial infection may be of lower transmissibility and may not persist after a short follow-up. The long-term health effects of some positive NAAT are uncertain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003525","authors":["S M Rogers","W C Miller","C F Turner","J Ellen","J Zenilman","R Rothman","M A Villarroel","A Al-Tayyib","P Leone","C Gaydos","L Ganapathi","M Hobbs","D Kanouse"],"doi":"10.1136\/sti.2007.027029","first_seen_on":"2017-09-19T10:48:21+00:00","issns":["1368-4973","1472-3263"],"issue":"1","journal":"Sexually Transmitted Infections","last_mentioned_on":1237453928,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/sti.2007.027029"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/sti.bmj.com\/content\/sextrans\/84\/1\/23.full.pdf","pmid":"17911137","pubdate":"2008-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Medical Society for the Study of Venereal Disease","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"23","subjects":["sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"Concordance of chlamydia trachomatis infections within sexual partnerships","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/concordance-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-within-sexual-partnerships-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8398082,"mean":7.0731310424293,"rank":2155169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5096893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8398082,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92278,"mean":11.601504968736,"rank":27871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":63804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92278,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2001,"mean":8.822115,"rank":987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2001,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.9871578947368,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
