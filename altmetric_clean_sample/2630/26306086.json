In multivariate logistic regression analyses serum cholesterol concentration and smoking habit were independent predictors of coronary heart disease (odds ratio serum cholesterol concentration 6.1 (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 17.6) current smoking 2.9 (1.1 to 7.5)) and of all cause mortality (3.2 (1.3 to 7.9), 3.0 (1.4 to 6.7) respectively) in diabetic men whereas systolic blood pressure, body mass index, family history, marital state, and alcohol abuse were not. Low occupational class was an independent predictor of mortality (2.4 (1.01 to 5.5)), but not of coronary heart disease, in diabetic men.\nMiddle aged diabetic men with hypercholesterolaemia are at very high risk of developing coronary heart disease and of dying prematurely. Lowering serum cholesterol concentration in such subjects seems to be warranted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245c","authors":["A. Rosengren","L. Welin","A. Tsipogianni","L.
