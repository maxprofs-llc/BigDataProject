Among these genes, miRNAs, which are negative posttranscriptional regulators, are also embedded in the Wnt signaling network. Different from the Wnt-induced oncogenic miRNAs, the specific mechanism underlying the Wnt-repressed tumor-suppressive miRNAs is much less understood. In the present study, firstly by analyzing a ChIP-seq dataset against TCF4, the core transcription factor for initiation of Wnt signaling in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, we screened out several tumor-suppressive miRNAs potentially regulated by Wnt signaling. Then through siRNA mediated knock-down tests and protein and chromatin immunoprecipitations, we found the TCF4-\u03b2-catenin complex can recruit the histone trimethylation complex PRC2 as a co-repressor while binding to the TCF4-binding element (TBE) in the promoter regions of miR-145, miR-132 and miR-212. Thus, upon Wnt signaling activation, the PRC2-mediated trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 increases at these promoter regions, leading to decreased miRNA levels. Furthermore, we found that by targeting TCF4 and SUZ12, the key components of the negative regulation complexes, the tumor-suppressive miR-145 co-repressed by Wnt signaling and histone trimethylation, forms double-negative regulation loops with its negative regulators in CRC cells. And the inverse associations between miR-145 and its targets\/negative regulators have also been demonstrated in nude mice and clinical samples. Collectively, we elucidated the detailed molecular mechanism of how dysregulated Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling and tumor-suppressive miRNAs reciprocally regulate each other in CRC cells.
