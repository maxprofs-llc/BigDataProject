However, there is a paucity of empirically founded information that relates to the specific steps for breaking bad news. We report on a set of guidelines for breaking bad news that was developed using a consensus process and incorporates the views of medical oncologists, general practitioners, surgeons, nurse consultants, social workers, clergy, human rights representatives, cancer patients, hospital interns, and clinical directors of medical schools in Australia.\nIt is recommended that further research be undertaken in a number of areas. First, there is a need to assess patients' versus providers' perceptions of the importance of each of the steps in breaking bad news, in order to define criteria for minimal levels of competence in this area. Second, controlled trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of the guidelines in changing clinical practice, and to identify the most effective strategies for breaking bad news to patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a18","authors":["Girgis, A","Sanson-Fisher, R W","A Girgis","R W Sanson-Fisher"],"doi":"10.1200\/jco.1995.13.9.2449","first_seen_on":"2016-09-29T14:42:28+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0732-183X","1527-7755"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1412294400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1200\/JCO.1995.13.9.2449"],"pmid":"7666105","pubdate":"1995-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Breaking bad news: consensus guidelines for medical practitioners.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/ascopubs.org\/doi\/10.1200\/JCO.1995.13.9.2449","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/breaking-bad-news-consensus-guidelines-medical-practitioners-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8049254,"mean":6.8393577843774,"rank":1303866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6676003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8049254,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247906,"mean":12.691577249349,"rank":60295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":187400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247906,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8538,"mean":14.068358908282,"rank":3053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8538,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":49.638236024845,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1,"Philosophy":1}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Improving Palliative Care for Cancer","url":"https:\/\/www.nap.edu\/download\/10149","license":"public","citation_ids":[16702285,14584757,14986651,14986652,14927140,14986653,14986654,14986655,14986656,14584799,16702287,14986661,14986663,14986664,14986665,14986667,1254226,14986669,14986671,5796365,14986674,5832880,4251781,14986675,22760417,14986676,14986677,14986678,14986679,18317979,3198168,14986680,14986681,18315699,793505,18317981,14986686,14584590,4829204,4722349,16702279,14986691,14986692,14986693,14986695,14986696,14986697,5832864,14986699,14986701,625953,14986702,18317982,14986703,14986704,14986705,14986706,14986707,18312775,14986708,14986710,14986711,14986712,14986714,1789889,4953770,12285464,18317987,18317989,4141752,14986715,16702281,14986716,14986718,12457283,14986720,18318002,14986721,1494149,221194,14986722,14986723,14986724,14986725,14986726,14986728,14986729,14986730,14986731,16702282,14986735,14986737,14986739,14986741,14986743,14486488,14583661,14986745,14986747,14986749,14986752,14986759,18252750,14986761,14986764,14986766,14986768,14986771,14986773,14986779,14986783,2395236,14986785,14986787,3619482,5818507,14986792,14584608,2322769,18318008,14986798,14986803,5906155,14986811,14986814,14986639,14986640,14584532,14986642,14986804,3054834,14986645,14986646,20472034,3132316,14986647,14986648,14986649,14584736,14986650,14986821,14986823,14986828,14986831,14986836,22761137,14598054,14986849,14985630,14986862,1475557,2073218,14986865,14584765,14986869,15007485,8414064,14986874,14598917,14986878,1368862,14584483,14584497,14986881,14986883,14986888,14584519,14986892,14986897,14985656,14986899,5741535,1054387,14986904,20472035,14986908,14986909,14986914,14986917,14986921,14986924,12457275,3701078,14584813,14986929,948488,18316952,18318010,14986932,14986934,14986935,14986937,18318011,14986939,14986940,14985633,14986942,3979835,14986945,1188341,14511541,18318013,18318016,16702289,14986946,14986948,14584568,14986950,14986952,14986954,3173152,14597790,14986956,14986958,1368869,14584617,2555583],"posted_on":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"National Academies Press","description":"The US National Academies Press (NAP) was created by the National Academy of Sciences to publish the reports of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, operating under a charter granted by the Congress of the United States.
