In the present study it was hypothesized that physiotherapy prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) would be safe and effective for patients unable to receive low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). In addition, this study investigated whether a combined therapy of IPC with LMWH would be more effective for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in critical patients. A total of 500 patients were divided into four groups according to the prophylaxis of DVT. The IPC group consisted of 95 patients with heparin contraindication that received IPC treatment; the LMWH group consisted of 185 patients that received an LMWH injection; the LMWH + IPC group consisted of 75 patients that received IPC treatment and LMWH injection; and the control group consisted of 145 patients that received no IPC treatment or injection of LMWH. Each patient was evaluated clinically for development of DVT and the diagnosis was confirmed by Doppler study. Venous thromboembolism was a common complication among the trauma patients with severe injuries. Patients responded positively to the treatment used in the intervention groups. Patients exhibited an improved response to LMWH + ICP compared with IPC or LMWH alone, while no significant difference was detected between the IPC and LMWH groups. These results were applicable to patients that had a Wells score of \u22653; however, no significant differences in DVT incidence were observed among the patients who had a Wells score of <3. In this observational study, LMWH + ICP appeared to be more effective than either treatment alone in treating critically ill trauma patients with severe injuries that are at high risk for VTE and bleeding simultaneously.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b6","authors":["Wan, Bing","Fu, Hai-Yan","Yin, Jiang-Tao","Ren, Guo-Qing","BING WAN","HAI-YAN FU","JIANG-TAO YIN","GUO-QING REN"],"doi":"10.3892\/etm.2015.2795","first_seen_on":"2016-09-29T13:33:20+00:00","issns":["1792-0981","1792-1015"],"issue":"6","journal":"Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1493565017,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26668637","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4665354\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4665354","pmid":"26668637","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Spandidos Publications","startpage":"2331","title":"Low\u2011molecular\u2011weight heparin and intermittent pneumatic compression for thromboprophylaxis in critical patients","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lowmolecularweight-heparin-intermittent-pneumatic-compression-thromboprophylaxis-critical-patients-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154803,"mean":6.8922645386048,"rank":5909750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1955864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154803,"percentile":23},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248719,"mean":12.719365369615,"rank":162405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":73337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248719,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":865,"mean":1.5517777777778,"rank":296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":865,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":3.2932432432432,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/accpcritprn\/statuses\/781486619018792960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12284202],"posted_on":"2016-09-29T13:31:43+00:00","author":{"name":"ACCP CRIT PRN","url":"http:\/\/accp.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/672177354135855104\/_iodHqSa_normal.jpg","description":"Promoting excellence and innovation in critical care pharmacy practice","id_on_source":"accpcritprn","tweeter_id":"4432743553","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":836},"tweet_id":"781486619018792960"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Saudi_Pharma\/statuses\/809999093250539520","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12284202],"posted_on":"2016-12-17T05:50:07+00:00","author":{"name":"\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0626\u064a","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/722191784613441536\/dIlKDIEm_normal.jpg","description":"\u27b0#\u0635\u064a\u062f\u0644\u064a_\u0627\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0643\u064a (#\u0639\u0644\u0627\u062c\u064a\u0627\u062a_\u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0636_\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0628)\n#\u0635\u064a\u062f\u0644\u0629_\u0627\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629\u27b0 (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0631\u0643\u062a = \u0623\u0633\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0636\u0649)","id_on_source":"Saudi_Pharma","tweeter_id":"1594346707","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":13844},"tweet_id":"809999093250539520"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Saudi_Pharma\/statuses\/858700037483835392","license":"gnip","rt":["Saudi_Pharma"],"citation_ids":[12284202],"posted_on":"2017-04-30T15:10:17+00:00","author":{"name":"\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0626\u064a","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/722191784613441536\/dIlKDIEm_normal.jpg","description":"\u27b0#\u0635\u064a\u062f\u0644\u064a_\u0627\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0643\u064a (#\u0639\u0644\u0627\u062c\u064a\u0627\u062a_\u0623\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0636_\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0628)\n#\u0635\u064a\u062f\u0644\u0629_\u0627\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629\u27b0 (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0631\u0643\u062a = \u0623\u0633\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0636\u0649)","id_on_source":"Saudi_Pharma","tweeter_id":"1594346707","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":13844},"tweet_id":"858700037483835392"}]}}
