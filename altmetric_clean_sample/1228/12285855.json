In this study, we found that the psychological stress mediator adrenaline inhibited osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived stem cells (hMSC) by reducing microRNA-21 (miR-21) expression. Briefly, adrenaline significantly inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs, as observed with both Alizarin red staining and maker gene expression (RUNX2, OSX, OCN and OPN). During this process, miR-21 was suppressed by adrenaline via inhibition of histone acetylation, as verified by H3K9Ac chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. MiR-21 was confirmed to promote hMSC osteogenic differentiation, and overexpression of miR-21 reversed the impeditive effect of adrenaline on hMSC osteogenic differentiation. Our results demonstrate that down-regulation of miR-21 is responsible for the adrenaline-mediated inhibition of hMSC osteogenic differentiation. These findings indicate a regulation of bone metabolism by psychological stress and also provide a molecular basis for psychological stress-associated bone diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c3","authors":["Chen, Danying","Wang, Zuolin"],"doi":"10.1002\/cbin.10685","first_seen_on":"2016-09-29T15:03:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-8355"],"journal":"Cell Biology International","last_mentioned_on":1475161373,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbin.10685\/abstract;jsessionid=2B5E9B2BA7C7248B8032A8FF9057F9A6.f03t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbin.10685\/pdf","pmid":"27671240","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Adrenaline inhibits osteogenesis via repressing miR-21 expression","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adrenaline-inhibits-osteogenesis-via-repressing-mir21-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":4516351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2354285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252967,"mean":12.751446605472,"rank":139102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252967,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":1.922614213198,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.44444444444444,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
