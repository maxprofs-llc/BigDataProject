Nutrient intake was analyzed to estimate the daily consumption levels of various nutrients and compared with national guidelines for intake.\nThere were 658 FFQs available for analysis; 69.9\u00a0% of respondents were boys, with a median age [Interquartile range (IQR)] of 11\u00a0years (8-15). Median daily sodium, potassium, and phosphorus intake was 3089\u00a0mg (2294-4243), 2384\u00a0mg (1804-3076), and 1206\u00a0mg (894-1612) respectively. Sodium and phosphorus consumptions were higher than recommended in all age groups. Caloric intake decreased with dropping glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (p\u2009=\u20090.003). The median daily caloric intakes were 1307\u00a0kcal in male children 2-3\u00a0years old, 1875\u00a0kcal in children 4-8\u00a0years old, 1923\u00a0kcal in those 9-13\u00a0years old, and 2427\u00a0kcal in those 14-18\u00a0years old. Respective levels for girls were 1467\u00a0kcal, 1736\u00a0kcal, 1803\u00a0kcal, and 2281\u00a0kcal. Median protein intake exceeded recommended levels in all age groups, particularly among younger participants. Younger children were more likely than older children to exceed the recommended intakes for phosphorus (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and the age-specific recommended caloric intake (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Macronutrient distribution (carbohydrate:fat:protein) was consistent with recommendation.\nChildren in the CKiD cohort consumed more sodium, phosphorus, protein, and calories than recommended. The gap between actual consumption and recommendations indicates a need for improved nutritional counseling and monitoring.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b0","authors":["Wun Fung Hui","Aisha Betoko","Jonathan D.
