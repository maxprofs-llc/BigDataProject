The primary end point was to assess procedural feasibility and safety; the secondary end point was to evaluate cardiac function and heart failure status through 36-month follow-up.\nNo complications, including tumor formation, were reported within 36 months after CDC infusion. Echocardiography showed significantly greater improvement in right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) in infants receiving CDCs than in controls at 36 months (+8.0% \u00b1 4.7% vs +2.2% \u00b1 4.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). These cardiac function improvements resulted in reduced brain natriuretic peptide levels (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04), lower incidence of unplanned catheter interventions (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04), and higher weight-for-age z score (P\u00a0=\u00a0.02) at 36 months relative to controls. As independent predictors of treatment responsiveness, absolute changes in RVEF at 36 months were negatively correlated with age, weight-for-age z score, and RVEF at CDC infusion.\nIntracoronary CDC infusion after staged procedure in patients with HLHS is safe and improves RVEF, which persists during 36-month follow-up. This therapeutic strategy may enhance somatic growth and reduce incidence of heart failure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007efa","authors":["Tarui, Suguru","Ishigami, Shuta","Ousaka, Daiki","Kasahara, Shingo","Ohtsuki, Shinichi","Sano, Shunji","Oh, Hidemasa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jtcvs.2015.06.076","endpage":"1208.e2","first_seen_on":"2016-03-29T10:19:37+00:00","issns":["1097-685X","00225223"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1459246039,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26232942?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26232942?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26232942","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1198","subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Transcoronary infusion of cardiac progenitor cells in hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Three-year follow-up of the Transcoronary Infusion of Cardiac Progenitor Cells in Patients With Single-Ventricle Physiology (TICAP) trial","type":"article","volume":"150","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcoronary-infusion-cardiac-progenitor-cells-hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-threeyear-followup-t-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7458268,"mean":6.4789686129458,"rank":3838884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2087907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7458268,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274903,"mean":11.011700562382,"rank":149430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":97510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274903,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1619,"mean":3.2162237330037,"rank":683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1619,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":2.3627010309278,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
