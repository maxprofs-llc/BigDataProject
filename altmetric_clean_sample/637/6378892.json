We tried to evaluate subjective ratings of facial attractiveness and identify which facial aesthetic subunits were important for facial attractiveness.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted of 150 samples (referred to as candidates). Frontal photographs were analyzed. An orthodontist, a prosthodontist, an oral surgeon, a dentist, an artist, a photographer and two laymen (estimators) subjectively evaluated candidates' faces using visual analog scale (VAS) scores. As an objective method for facial analysis, we used balanced angular proportional analysis (BAPA). Using SAS 10.1 (SAS Institute Inc.), the Turkey's studentized range test and Pearson correlation analysis were performed to detect between-group differences in VAS scores (Experiment 1), to identify correlations between VAS scores and BAPA scores (Experiment 2), and to analyze the characteristic features of facial attractiveness and gender differences (Experiment 3); the significance level was set at P=0.05.\nExperiment 1 revealed some differences in VAS scores according to professional characteristics. In Experiment 2, BAPA scores were found to behave similarly to subjective ratings of facial beauty, but showed a relatively weak correlation coefficient with the VAS scores. Experiment 3 found that the decisive factors for facial attractiveness were different for men and women. Composite images of attractive Indian male and female faces were constructed.\nOur photogrammetric study, statistical analysis, and average composite faces of an Indian population provide valuable information about subjective perceptions of facial beauty and attractive facial structures in the Indian population.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef772a83ee09648b5289","authors":["Duggal, Shveta","Kapoor, D N","Verma, Santosh","Sagar, Mahesh","Lee, Yung-Seop","Moon, Hyoungjin","Rhee, Seung Chul","Kapoor, DN","Shveta Duggal","DN Kapoor","Santosh Verma","Mahesh Sagar","Yung-Seop Lee","Hyoungjin Moon","Seung Chul Rhee"],"doi":"10.5999\/aps.2016.43.2.160","first_seen_on":"2016-03-29T23:14:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2234-6163","2234-6171"],"issue":"2","journal":"Archives of Plastic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1485920367,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27019809?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.e-aps.org\/DOIx.php?id=10.5999\/aps.2016.43.2.160","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5999\/aps.2016.43.2.160","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27019809"],"pmid":"27019809","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"160","title":"Photogrammetric Analysis of Attractiveness in Indian Faces","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/synapse.koreamed.org\/DOIx.php?id=10.5999\/aps.2016.43.2.160","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/photogrammetric-analysis-attractiveness-indian-faces"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":5914444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1957620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":23},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280044,"mean":11.221911984945,"rank":180524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":82958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280044,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":2.4831428571429,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.55,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
