To guide our analysis and discussion, we followed the two-dimension model of CSR proposed by Quazi and O'Brien.\nAccording to interviewee responses, mean percentage of agreement with CSR concept was 77.4%, with a range of 54-85.7%. Main health-related issues among farmworkers were infectious diseases, crowding, and access to health-care services; there were acute cases of undernutrition among farmworkers' children and diets were of poor quality.\nAgribusiness owners and managers understand and practice CSR according to a wide and modern view, which contradicts with farmworkers' living conditions and health. Quazi and O'Brien model should consider the social context, in which it is analyzed, and the social manifestations of community development as a tool for further analysis on the perceptions and actions of entrepreneurs.","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b4570","authors":["Ortega, Mar\u00eda Isabel","Sabo, Samantha","Aranda Gallegos, Patricia","De Zapien, Jill Eileen Guernsey","Zapien, Antonio","Portillo Abril, Gloria Elena","Rosales, Cecilia"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpubh.2016.00054","first_seen_on":"2016-03-29T17:38:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2296-2565"],"journal":"Frontiers in Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1459262901,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpubh.2016.00054\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpubh.2016.00054\/pdf","pmid":"27066471","pubdate":"2016-03-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Agribusiness, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Health of Agricultural Migrant Workers","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agribusiness-corporate-social-responsibility-health-agricultural-migrant-workers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7458268,"mean":6.4789686129458,"rank":5644010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":997917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7458268,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274902,"mean":11.0117589896,"rank":193180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274902,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":831,"mean":8.5676240963855,"rank":563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":831,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":9.8863376623377,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
