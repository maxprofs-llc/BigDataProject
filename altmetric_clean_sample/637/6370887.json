Four compounds have been found to possess significant activity, in the nanomolar range, and represent hits for further optimisation towards novel treatments for Human and Animal African Trypanosomiases. Moreover, SAR indicates that the head group linking moiety is a significant modulator of biological activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["Scott, Fraser J","Khalaf, Abedawn I","Giordani, Federica","Wong, Pui Ee","Duffy, Sandra","Barrett, Michael","Avery, Vicky M","Suckling, Colin J","Scott, Fraser J.","Fraser J.
