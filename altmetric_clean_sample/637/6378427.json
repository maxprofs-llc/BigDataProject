In the presence of a large excess of 1-phenylethylamine, single crystals of the corresponding 1:3 host-guest complex were obtained, which provide the crystallographic structure of a host-guest complex consisting of an achiral porphyrin and a chiral monoamine. The structure reveals the 1-phenylethylamines adopt the \"inside\" binding mode that is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The NH2 of the 1-phenylethylamine is involved in both coordination and hydrogen bonding interactions. Circular dichroism (CD) and ultraviolet-visible spectra revealed that the 1:3 host-guest complex is dominant in the presence of a large excess of 1-phenylethylamine. The crystal structure shows there are two diastereomers of the 1:3 host-guest complexes. Density functional theory and TDDFT calculations suggest that one of the diastereomers is more energetically favorable, which dominates the CD signals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Zhen Han"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b02295","first_seen_on":"2016-03-29T22:49:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1459287122,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b02295?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b02295"],"pmid":"27023769","pubdate":"2016-03-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Crystallographic and Spectroscopic Studies of a Host\u2013Guest Complex Consisting of a Novel Zinc Trisporphyrinate and a Chiral Monoamine","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystallographic-spectroscopic-studies-hostguest-complex-consisting-novel-zinc-trisporphyrinate-chir"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7458268,"mean":6.4789686129458,"rank":3624634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3645425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7458268,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274902,"mean":11.011766810597,"rank":137764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":126726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274902,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8622,"mean":1.1068117387774,"rank":2005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":6293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8622,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":373,"mean":0.93413978494624,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":373,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":2,"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/714897711133118464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6378427],"posted_on":"2016-03-29T19:31:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1298},"tweet_id":"714897711133118464"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EmilyEHardy\/statuses\/714904267895808000","license":"gnip","rt":["InorganicNews"],"citation_ids":[6378427],"posted_on":"2016-03-29T19:57:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Emily Hardy","url":"http:\/\/ehardyeportfolio.weebly.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/900206141313077249\/F8nsS6rX_normal.jpg","description":"doctoral candidate \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udd2c f-block coordination chemist \u2622\ufe0f casual sailor \u26f5\ufe0f amateur painter \ud83c\udfa8 weekend musician \ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb7\ud83c\udfb8","id_on_source":"EmilyEHardy","tweeter_id":"89784158","geo":{"lt":32.60986,"ln":-85.48078,"country":"US"},"followers":150},"tweet_id":"714904267895808000"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorgChem\/statuses\/714928124564213761","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6378427],"posted_on":"2016-03-29T21:32:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/IC","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2249495742\/ic-twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief Bill Tolman and IC staff on fundamental studies in all phases of inorganic chemistry, including bioinorganic chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorgChem","tweeter_id":"583802897","geo":{"lt":38.91706,"ln":-77.00025,"country":"US"},"followers":5831},"tweet_id":"714928124564213761"}]}}
