Acute and late gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity were prospectively evaluated according to modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. Biochemical control was defined according to the Phoenix criteria (prostate-specific antigen nadir\u2009+\u20092\u2009ng\/mL).\nIn total, 215 patients were enrolled in the IMRT group (n\u2009=\u2009109) or the 3DCRT group (n\u2009=\u2009106). The 3DCRT arm had a 27% rate of grade\u2009\u2265\u20092 acute GU toxicity compared with a 9% rate in the IMRT arm (P\u2009=\u2009.001) and a 24% rate of grade\u2009\u2265\u20092 acute GI toxicity compared with a 7% rate in the IMRT arm (P\u2009=\u2009.001). The maximal rate of grade \u22652 late GU toxicity during the entire period of follow-up was 3.7% in the IMRT group versus 12.3% in the 3DCRT group (P\u2009=\u2009.02). The maximal rate of grade \u22652 late GI toxicity during the entire follow-up was 6.4% in the IMRT group versus 21.7% in the 3DCRT group (P\u2009=\u2009.001). The 5-year rate of freedom from biochemical failure was 95.4% in the IMRT arm and 94.3% in the 3DCRT arm (P\u2009=\u2009.678).\nIMRT reduced the delivery of significant radiation doses to the bladder and rectum using a similar target volume. This dosimetric advantage resulted in a lower rate of acute\/late grade\u2009\u2265\u20092 GI and GU toxicity for IMRT compared with 3DCRT.
