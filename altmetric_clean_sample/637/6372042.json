Nevertheless, the results remain controversial and inconclusive. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of all eligible case-control studies to evaluate the association between L55M polymorphism and cancer risk. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the associations. Finally, a total of 5,627 cases and 6,390 controls, arising from 21 case-control studies, were enrolled in our study. Significant associations between PON1-L55M polymorphism and overall cancer risk were identified in all genetic models. In the stratified analyses by cancer type, PON1-L55M polymorphism was a risk factor for breast cancer in all genetic models, prostate cancer in the heterozygote model (ML vs LL: OR =1.304, 95% CI =1.049-1.620, P heterogeneity=0.067), and ovarian cancer in the recessive model (MM vs ML\/LL: OR =1.526, 95% CI =1.110-2.097, P heterogeneity=0.464). Similarly, an increased risk was also identified for the Caucasian population in the heterozygote comparison and homozygote models, and hospital-based controls in all genetic models. To sum up, our study suggests that the PON1-L55M allele increased the risk of cancer. Future well-designed studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further verify these findings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bca2","authors":["Chen, Lei","Lu, Wei","Fang, Lu","Xiong, Hu","Wu, Xun","Zhang, Meng","Wu, Song","Yu, Dexin"],"doi":"10.2147\/ott.s96990","first_seen_on":"2016-03-29T10:36:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-6930"],"journal":"OncoTargets and therapy","last_mentioned_on":1459246630,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27019599?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27019599","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1151","title":"Association between L55M polymorphism in Paraoxonase 1 and cancer risk: a meta-analysis based on 21 studies","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-l55m-polymorphism-paraoxonase-1-cancer-risk-metaanalysis-based-21-studies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7458268,"mean":6.4789686129458,"rank":6460283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7458268,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274903,"mean":11.011710202181,"rank":232583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274903,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":881,"mean":1.3130454545455,"rank":567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":881,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":1.845,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/714758289855262721","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6372042],"posted_on":"2016-03-29T10:17:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"714758289855262721"}]}}
