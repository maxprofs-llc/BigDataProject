In this study, we explored the influence of chronic OSA on left ventricular structural remodeling in canines, and the potential therapeutical role of metoprolol.\nChronic OSA model was established by stopping the ventilator and closing the airway for 4 h\/day apnea-ventilation cycles every other day for 12 weeks while metoprolol (5 mg\u00b7 kg(-1)\u00b7 day(-1)) were administered continuously. Norepinephrine concentration was measured by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Transmission electron microscopy, Hematoxylin and eosin, TUNEL and Masson trichrome staining were employed to detect the morphology, apoptosis and fibrosis of cardiomyocytes. Protein expression of apoptosis and fibrosis-related factors including apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), caspase 3, Bcl-2, Bax, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were examined by Western blotting.\nNorepinephrine concentration was markedly increased in chronic OSA dogs and reduced by metoprolol. Both the apoptotic ratio and collagen volume fraction were significantly increased in left ventricular myocytes of chronic OSA dogs, and was reversed by metoprolol. Moreover, chronic OSA-induced upregulation of AIF, cleaved caspase 3, Bax, \u03b1-SMA, and TGF-\u03b21 as well as downregulation of Bcl-2 was markedly recovered by metoprolol, which was mediated by p38 MAPK.\nMetoprolol protects against chronic OSA-induced cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis in left ventricular myocytes of canines, which may provide new potential strategy for drug therapy of OSA. \u00a9 2015 S.
