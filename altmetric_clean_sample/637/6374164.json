We investigated differentiation within the forma specialis of their obligate powdery mildew pathogen, Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt). A total of 61 Bgt isolates were collected from the three host species in four geographic regions of Israel. Genetic relatedness of the isolates was characterized using both virulence patterns on 38 wheat lines (including 21 Pm differentials) and presumptively neutral molecular markers (simple-sequence repeats and single-nucleotide polymorphisms). All isolates were virulent on at least some genotypes of all three wheat species tested. All assays divided the Bgt collection into two distinct groups: those from domesticated hosts and those from wild emmer wheat. One-way migration was detected from the domestic-wheat Bgt population to the wild emmer Bgt population at a rate of five to six migrants per generation. This gene flow may help explain the overlap between the distinct domestic and wild Bgt groups. Overall, Bgt is significantly differentiated into wild-emmer and domesticated-wheat populations although the results do not support the existence of a separate f.sp. dicocci.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003329","authors":["Ben-David, Roi","Parks, Ryan","Dinoor, Amos","Kosman, Evsey","Wicker, Thomas","Keller, Beat","Cowger, Christina","Roi Ben-David"],"doi":"10.1094\/phyto-07-15-0177-r","endpage":"870","first_seen_on":"2016-03-29T15:04:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0031-949X"],"issue":"8","journal":"Phytopathology","last_mentioned_on":1477662420,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27019062?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1094\/PHYTO-07-15-0177-R"],"pmid":"27019062","pubdate":"2016-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"861","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Differentiation among Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolates originating from wild vs. domesticated Triticum species in Israel","type":"article","volume":"106","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differentiation-among-blumeria-graminis-f-sp-tritici-isolates-originating-wild-versus-domesticated-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":3933700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2132547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276556,"mean":11.032759834391,"rank":150560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":98277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276556,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":847,"mean":2.8766595744681,"rank":594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":847,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":4.0754146341463,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
