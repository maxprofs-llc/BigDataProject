Western blotting was used to detect antibodies to CagA. Semen parameters were determined following World Health Organization guidelines and sperm apoptosis and necrosis by annexin V and propidium iodide assay.\nTwenty-eight subjects were infected by HP (HP+); among them, 12 were CagA seropositive (CagA+) and 16 were negative (CagA-). Eighty-one men were HP seronegative (HP-). Semen TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 concentrations were increased in HP+ vs HP- groups (TNF-\u03b1: 41 pg\/mL vs 27 pg\/mL; IL-6: 11 pg\/mL vs 5 pg\/mL; P\u00a0<.01). In comparison to the HP- group, CagA+ group showed reduced sperm motility (24% vs 32% motile sperm; P\u00a0<.05), enhanced necrosis (33.5% vs 21% necrotic sperm; P\u00a0<.05), and increased cytokines levels (TNF-\u03b1: 46 pg\/mL vs 27 pg\/mL; P\u00a0<.01; IL-6: 17.5 pg\/mL vs 5 pg\/mL; P\u00a0<.01). Sperm motility of CagA+ group was lower vs CagA- group (24% vs 36.5% motile sperm; P\u00a0<.05). Both IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels positively correlated with the percentage of necrotic sperm (P\u00a0<.001).\nCagA+ HP infection increases semen levels of inflammatory cytokines, which may reduce sperm motility and determine sperm damage and contribute to reduce the reproductive potential in men.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Moretti, Elena","Figura, Natale","Campagna, Maria Stella","Gonnelli, Stefano","Iacoponi, Francesca","Collodel, Giulia","Elena Moretti","Natale Figura","Maria Stella Campagna","Stefano Gonnelli","Francesca Iacoponi","Giulia Collodel"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urology.2015.02.068","endpage":"47","first_seen_on":"2016-03-29T12:25:14+00:00","issns":["1527-9995","00904295"],"issue":"1","journal":"Urology","last_mentioned_on":1459281750,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26142579","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.urology.2015.02.068"],"pmid":"26142579","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"41","title":"Sperm Parameters and Semen Levels of Inflammatory Cytokines in Helicobacter pylori\u2013infected Men","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sperm-parameters-semen-levels-inflammatory-cytokines-helicobacter-pyloriinfected-men"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7458268,"mean":6.4789686129458,"rank":3292471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4092659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7458268,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274903,"mean":11.011697652254,"rank":119326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":151077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274903,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2938,"mean":3.6281498127341,"rank":1296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2938,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":2.766815920398,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
