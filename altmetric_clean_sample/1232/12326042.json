DNA was obtained from peripheral blood white cells.\nSignificant difference was found in family history of alcoholism and use of other psychoactive substances to compare alcoholics with controls. When allelic frequencies for each category (gender) were considered, frequency of A2 allele carriers in ADH2 was found higher in male patients than controls. In women, the relative frequency for c1 allele in CYP2E1 was lower in controls than alcoholics. The ALDH2 locus is monomorphic. No significant differences in allele distributions of the loci examined to compare two populations were observed, however when stratifying the same trend was found that these differences tended to be significant.\nThis study allows us to conclude the positive association between family history of alcoholism and alcoholism suggesting that there is a favourable hereditary predisposition. Since substance dependence requires interaction of multiple genes, the combination of genotypes ADH2 * 2, CYP2E1 * 1 combined with genotype homozygous ALDH2 * 1 found in this study could be leading to the population to a potential risk to alcoholism.","altmetric_jid":"56a768df2a83eeb12a8b47ee","authors":["M\u00e9ndez, Claudia","Rey, Mauricio"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-30T13:49:32+00:00","issns":["1657-9534"],"issue":"4","journal":"Colombia M\u00e9dica","last_mentioned_on":1475243357,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26848198"],"pmcid":"PMC4732507","pmid":"26848198","title":"Characterization of polymorphisms of genes ADH2, ADH3, ALDH2 and CYP2E1 and relationship to the alcoholism in a Colombian population.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-polymorphisms-genes-adh2-adh3-aldh2-cyp2e1-relationship-alcoholism-colombian-popula"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":6414647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253248,"mean":12.767612402121,"rank":176833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":45797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253248,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.5192380952381,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
