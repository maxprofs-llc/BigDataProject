Its purpose was to identify strategies that individuals and systems can use to mitigate the detrimental effects of moral distress and foster moral resilience. On August 11 and 12, 2016, an invitational symposium, State of the Science: Transforming Moral Distress into Moral Resilience in Nursing, was held at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in Baltimore, Maryland. Forty-five nurse clinicians, researchers, ethicists, organization representatives, and other stakeholders took part. The result of the symposium was group consensus on recommendations for addressing moral distress and building moral resilience in four areas: practice, education, research, and policy. Participants and the organizations represented were energized and committed to moving this agenda forward.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002204","authors":["Rushton, Cynda Hylton","Schoonover-Shoffner, Kathy","Kennedy, Maureen Shawn","Cynda Hylton Rushton","Kathy Schoonover-shoffner","Maureen Shawn Kennedy"],"doi":"10.1097\/01.naj.0000512203.08844.1d","endpage":"S6","first_seen_on":"2017-01-18T09:17:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1538-7488","0002-936X"],"issue":"2 Suppl 1","journal":"American Journal of Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1487270092,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28085699","http:\/\/insights.ovid.com\/ajn-american-nursing\/ajnr\/2017\/02\/001\/collaborative-state-science-initiative\/1\/00000446","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ajnonline\/Fulltext\/2017\/02001\/A_Collaborative_State_of_the_Science_Initiative__.1.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ajnonline\/2017\/02001\/A_Collaborative_State_of_the_Science_Initiative__.1.pdf","pmid":"28085699","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"S2","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"A Collaborative State of the Science Initiative","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/content.wkhealth.com\/linkback\/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&an=00000446-201702001-00001","volume":"117"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.88,"score_history":{"1y":11.88,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.88},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":712267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7506652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266627,"mean":12.738645135883,"rank":36787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":229830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266627,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1259,"mean":4.4890015898251,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1259,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":8.0442857142857,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mykhalko\/statuses\/821647536012361729","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15559715],"posted_on":"2017-01-18T09:16:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Natalya Mykhalko","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/466684084865888256\/LR9j5Lzk_normal.jpeg","description":"Bioethicist (bioethics of reproduction)  Research&interests:  #reproethics #bioethics http:\/\/mykhalkonata.blogspot.com\/","id_on_source":"mykhalko","tweeter_id":"81108258","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3071},"tweet_id":"821647536012361729"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bermaninstitute\/statuses\/826097366583406593","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15559715],"posted_on":"2017-01-30T15:58:54+00:00","author":{"name":"JHU Berman Institute","url":"http:\/\/www.bioethicsinstitute.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/875715835020677121\/SxG9TLCz_normal.jpg","description":"The Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics.
