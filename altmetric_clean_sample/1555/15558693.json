Here, the authors have developed a nanohybrid material to significantly enhance the catalytic activity of AuNCs by combining them with other inorganic enzyme mimetics, Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), through electrostatic attraction. Owing to the synergistic effect by incorporating AuNCs and MNPs, the constructed nanohybrids yielded highly enhanced catalytic activity and enabled rapid catalytic oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine substrate to produce a blue-colored solution in proportional to the amount of H2O2. Moreover, a highly sensitive and selective glucose biosensing strategy was developed based on the coupled catalytic action between glucose oxidase and the nanohybrids. Using this method, target glucose was successfully detected in a linear concentration range from 150 to 750\u2009\u03bcM with a detection limit as low as 100\u2009\u03bcM. Along with excellent linearity, high precision and reproducibility were achieved by employing real human blood serums, which enables its use for the reliable quantification of glucose in practical use. Based on these results, the authors anticipate that the nanohybrids consisting of MNPs and AuNCs can serve as potent peroxidase mimics for the detection of clinically important target molecules.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5693cf058f610004b26","authors":["Seongyeon Cho","Ho Yun Shin","Moon Il Kim"],"doi":"10.1116\/1.4974198","first_seen_on":"2017-01-18T07:56:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1934-8630","1559-4106"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biointerphases","last_mentioned_on":1484858921,"links":["http:\/\/avs.scitation.org\/doi\/full\/10.1116\/1.4974198"],"pmid":"28095700","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"01A401","subjects":["biomedicalengineering","biotechnology"],"title":"Nanohybrids consisting of magnetic nanoparticles and gold nanoclusters as effective peroxidase mimics and their application for colorimetric detection of glucose","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanohybrid-consisting-magnetic-nanoparticles-gold-nanoclusters-effective-peroxidase-mimic-applicatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":3592255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4402157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259149,"mean":12.823120934755,"rank":115861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":139017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259149,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":2.33975,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.5083333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
