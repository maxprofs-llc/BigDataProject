However, the mechanisms underlying OXT's antinociceptive effect on neuropathic pain are not fully understood. In the present study, we examined the peripheral effect of OXT on mechanical hypersensitivity induced by partial ligation of the infraorbital nerve (PNL) in rats. Mechanical hypersensitivity in the whisker pad skin following PNL was attenuated by the direct administration of OXT into the trigeminal ganglion (TG). The proportion of vasopressin 1A receptor (V1A-R)-immunoreactive, but not OXT-receptor-immunoreactive, neurons significantly increased among TG neurons innervating the whisker pad skin after PNL. In a patch-clamp recording from TG neurons isolated from PNL rats, the resting membrane potential (RMP) of OXT-treated neurons was significantly decreased, and the current thresholds of OXT-treated neurons for spike generation (rheobases) were significantly greater than those of vehicle-treated neurons. Additionally, OXT increased voltage-gated K (Kv) channel currents in PNL animals. Furthermore, intra-TG administration of a selective V1A-R antagonist reversed the OXT-induced alleviation of mechanical hypersensitivity, and co-application of the antagonist opposed OXT's effects on the RMP, rheobase, and K current. These findings suggest that OXT is effective at suppressing TG neuronal hyperexcitability following nerve injury, likely by modulation of Kv channels via V1A-R. This signaling mechanism represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of orofacial neuropathic pain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003281","authors":["Kubo, Asako","Shinoda, Masamichi","Katagiri, Ayano","Takeda, Mamoru","Suzuki, Tatsuro","Asaka, Junichi","Yeomans, David C","Iwata, Koichi","Asako Kubo","Masamichi Shinoda","Ayano Katagiri","Mamoru Takeda","Tatsuro Suzuki","Junichi Asaka","David C Yeomans","Koichi Iwata"],"doi":"10.1097\/j.pain.0000000000000808","first_seen_on":"2017-01-18T06:45:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-6623","0304-3959"],"journal":"Pain (03043959)","last_mentioned_on":1493078400,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28072605","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/j.pain.0000000000000808"],"pmid":"28072605","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Pain","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Oxytocin alleviates orofacial mechanical hypersensitivity associated with infraorbital nerve injury via vasopressin 1A receptors of the rat trigeminal ganglia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxytocin-alleviates-orofacial-mechanical-hypersensitivity-associated-infraorbital-nerve-injury-throu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093859,"mean":6.8854427063012,"rank":3803968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4109708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093859,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260555,"mean":12.807583049962,"rank":126550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":126802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260555,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3255,"mean":9.4887695144438,"rank":2178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3255,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":31.076683544304,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
