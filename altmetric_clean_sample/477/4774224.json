Scleral fixation of acrylic hydrophilic PCIOL was performed according to the described technique, and the patients were evaluated on the day 1, 3, 14, and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively for IOL centration, pseudophakodonesis, change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and any other complications.\nOut of twenty-nine eyes of 24 patients, who completed the study, 25 (86.2%) eyes had improved, 2 (6.9%) eyes showed no change, and 2 (6.9%) eyes had worsening of BCVA. Three (10.3%) eyes developed postoperative complications. A significant improvement in mean BCVA (P < 0.0001) was observed after the procedure. Mean duration of follow-up was 26.2 months (range 22-35 months).\nThe use of closed loop haptic acrylic IOL for scleral fixation appears to be safe and effective alternative to conventional scleral fixated polymethyl methacrylate intraocular lenses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aaf","authors":["Agrawal","Siddharth Agrawal","Vinita Singh","Sanjiv Kumar Gupta","Nibha Misra","Rajat M Srivastava"],"doi":"10.4103\/0301-4738.169797","first_seen_on":"2015-11-17T19:49:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1998-3689"],"issue":"8","journal":"Indian Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1447785569,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijo.in\/text.asp?2015\/63\/8\/649\/169797"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijo.in\/article.asp?issn=0301-4738;year=2015;volume=63;issue=8;spage=649;epage=653;aulast=Agrawal;type=2","pmid":"26576522","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Transscleral fixation of closed loop haptic acrylic posterior chamber intraocular lens in aphakic nonvitrectomized eyes","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transscleral-fixation-closed-loop-haptic-acrylic-posterior-chamber-intraocular-lens-aphakic-nonvitre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6577121,"mean":6.1012807651375,"rank":5611507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6577121,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247792,"mean":9.280614009387,"rank":196038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247792,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":596,"mean":0.94504201680672,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":596,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":0.70283018867925,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/statuses\/666687115439251456","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4774224],"posted_on":"2015-11-17T18:39:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
