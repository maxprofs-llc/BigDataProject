The net effect of LTBI treatment was quantified in terms of quality-adjusted life-years gained or lost. Analyses were conducted for a representative set of hypothetical patients.LTBI treatment was estimated to be beneficial when the annual risk of TB reactivation exceeded 13\/100\u200a000 to 93\/100\u200a000 for females aged 10-75\u2005years and 15\/100\u200a000 to 119\/100\u200a000 for males aged 10-75\u2005years; the numbers needed to treat to avoid one case of TB were 93, 77, 85 and 72, respectively, at these threshold levels.LTBI treatment was estimated to confer a positive net benefit across a broad range of patients with characteristics typically seen in a low incidence setting for TB. Use of the decision aid has the potential to facilitate and increase confidence with LTBI treatment decisions by providing clinicians and patients with personalised estimates of likely net benefit.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007384","authors":["Claudia C.
