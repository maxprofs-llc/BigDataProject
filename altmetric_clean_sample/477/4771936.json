Anti-infection strategies must be tested in relevant animal models that will lead to appropriate clinical studies.\nFourteenNew Zealand White rabbits were divided into two groups: group 1: infected unmodified Ti screw group (n\u200a=\u200a6), group 2: infected polyethylene glycol grafted polypropylene based Silver nanoparticle(PP-g-PEG-Ag) covered Ti screw group (n\u200a=\u200a6), and two rabbits as sterile (sham operated and control)group. In all groups left L4- right L6 vertebra levels were exposed and screws were drilled to transverse processes after contamination of burr holes and surrounding tissue with 0.1 ml of 10 CFU MRSA solutionsin group 1 and 2.After 21 days, samples were collected and infection was analyzed via light and scanning electron microscopy and culturing. Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NP) on the screws and tissues were assayed pre and postoperatively.\nThe bacterial colony count for modified-Ti screw group was lower compared to unmodified Ti screw (17,2 vs 200 x 10\u200aCFU\/mL, p\u200a=\u200a0,029) with less biofilm formation. There was no difference in duration of surgery among groups and within the surgical sites. Ag-NPs were detected on the screw surface postoperatively.\nThis novel experimental design of implantation in rabbits is easy to apply and resembles human stabilization technique. Modified Ti screws were shown to have antimicrobial effect with especially inhibiting the biofilm formation. This anchored Ag NPs which remained after 21 day of implantation shows that it is resistant to tapping forces of the screw.\nN\/A.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Hazer, Derya Burcu","Sakar, Mustafa","Dere, Yelda","Altnkanat, G\u00fcl\u015fen","Ziyal, M Ibrahim","Hazer, Baki","Altinkanat, G\u00fclsen","Ziyal, M.
