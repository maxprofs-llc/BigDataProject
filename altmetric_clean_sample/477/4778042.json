Stabilized topoisomerase I cleavage complexes (Top1cc) by natural compounds or common DNA alterations are transcription-blocking lesions whose repair depends primarily on Top1 proteolysis and excision by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase-1 (TDP1). We previously reported that stabilized Top1cc produce transcription-dependent DSBs that activate ATM in neurons. Here, we use camptothecin (CPT)-treated serum-starved quiescent cells to induce transcription-blocking Top1cc and show that those DSBs are generated during Top1cc repair from Top1 peptide-linked DNA single-strand breaks generated after Top1 proteolysis and before excision by TDP1. Following DSB induction, ATM activates DNA-PK whose inhibition suppresses H2AX and H2A ubiquitination and the later assembly of activated ATM into nuclear foci. Inhibition of DNA-PK also reduces Top1 ubiquitination and proteolysis as well as resumption of RNA synthesis suggesting that DSB signaling further enhances Top1cc repair. Finally, we show that co-transcriptional DSBs kill quiescent cells. Together, these new findings reveal that DSB production and signaling by transcription-blocking Top1 lesions impact on non-replicating cell fate and provide insights on the molecular pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as SCAN1 and AT syndromes, which are caused by TDP1 and ATM deficiency, respectively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Agnese Cristini","Joon-Hyung Park","Giovanni Capranico","Ga\u00eblle Legube","Gilles Favre","Olivier Sordet"],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gkv1196","first_seen_on":"2015-11-18T10:13:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1448556973,"links":["http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/11\/16\/nar.gkv1196.full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=26578593"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/11\/16\/nar.gkv1196.full.pdf","pmid":"26578593","pubdate":"2015-11-19T22:00:53+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"DNA-PK triggers histone ubiquitination and signaling in response to DNA double-strand breaks produced during the repair of transcription-blocking topoisomerase I lesions.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dnapk-triggers-histone-ubiquitination-signaling-response-dna-doublestrand-breaks-produced-during-rep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6611727,"mean":6.131580845607,"rank":2459917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4052653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6611727,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249284,"mean":9.2774758005961,"rank":94016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":150783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249284,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9638,"mean":4.0948757912213,"rank":5656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":3812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9638,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":380,"mean":7.2439313984169,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":380,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
