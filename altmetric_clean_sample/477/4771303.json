Moreover, their biocompatibility is attractive for nutrient or drug delivery system applications. Here the three-dimensional organization of dispersed cubic lipid self-assembled phases is fully revealed by cryo-electron tomography and compared with simulated structures. It is demonstrated that the interior is constituted of a perfect bicontinuous cubic phase, while the outside shows interlamellar attachments, which represent a transition state between the liquid crystalline interior phase and the outside vesicular structure. Therefore, compositional gradients within cubosomes are inferred, with a lipid bilayer separating at least one water channel set from the external aqueous phase. This is crucial to understand and enhance controlled release of target molecules and calls for a revision of postulated transport mechanisms from cubosomes to the aqueous phase.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Davide Demurtas","Paul Guichard","Isabelle Martiel","Raffaele Mezzenga","C\u00e9cile H\u00e9bert","Laurent Sagalowicz"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms9915","first_seen_on":"2015-11-17T13:58:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1733","2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1502027699,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/NCOMMS9915","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1038\/NCOMMS9915","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/151117\/ncomms9915\/full\/ncomms9915.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/151117\/ncomms9915\/full\/ncomms9915.html?WT.ec_id=NCOMMS-20151118&spMailingID=50043462&spUserID=NDkwMjM5MzE2MwS2&spJobID=802458284&spReportId=ODAyNDU4Mjg0S0|website=Nature.com|publisher=Nature Communications","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/151117\/ncomms9915\/full\/ncomms9915.html?WT.ec_id=NCOMMS-20151118|website=Nature.com|publisher=Nature Communications"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms9915.pdf","pmid":"26573367","pubdate":"2015-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"ncomms9915","title":"Direct visualization of dispersed lipid bicontinuous cubic phases by cryo-electron tomography","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-visualization-dispersed-lipid-bicontinuous-cubic-phases-cryoelectron-tomography"},"altmetric_score":{"score":73.75,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":73.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":122367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8208885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296907,"mean":8.9897085407501,"rank":6944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":289961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296907,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12989,"mean":44.449598244533,"rank":2204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":10784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12989,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":650,"mean":52.613550077042,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":650,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
