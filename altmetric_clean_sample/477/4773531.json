Age and geographically matched prostate cancer controls treated with prostatectomy only (n\u2009=\u200986) were assessed at similar time intervals. Grip strength measured upper body strength, the Chair Rise Test measured lower body strength, and the SF-12 Physical Functioning scale measured self-reported physical functioning.\nAs expected, self-reported physical functioning and upper body muscle strength declined in ADT recipients but remained stable in prostate cancer controls. Contrary to expectations, lower body muscle strength remained stable in ADT recipients but improved in prostate cancer controls. Higher Gleason scores, more medical comorbidities, and less exercise at baseline predicted greater declines in physical functioning in ADT recipients.\nADT is associated with declines in self-reported physical functioning and upper body muscle strength as well as worse lower body muscle strength relative to prostate cancer controls. These findings should be included in patient education regarding the risks and benefits of ADT. Findings also underscore the importance of conducting research on ways to prevent or reverse declines in physical functioning in this patient population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035ed","authors":["Gonzalez, Brian D","Jim, Heather S L","Small, Brent J","Sutton, Steven K","Fishman, Mayer N","Zachariah, Babu","Heysek, Randy V","Jacobsen, Paul B","Brian D.
