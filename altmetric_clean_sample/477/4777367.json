Major-gene models have been considered for human handedness which allow for phenocopy and reduced penetrance, i.e. an imperfect correspondence between genotype and phenotype. However, a recent genome-wide association scan did not detect any common polymorphisms with substantial genetic effects. Previous linkage studies in families have also not yielded significant findings. Genetic heterogeneity and\/or polygenicity are therefore indicated, but it remains possible that relatively rare, or even unique, major-genetic effects may be detectable in certain extended families with many non-right-handed members. Here we applied whole exome sequencing to 17 members from a single, large consanguineous family from Pakistan. Multipoint linkage analysis across all autosomes did not yield clear candidate genomic regions for involvement in the trait and single-point analysis of exomic variation did not yield clear candidate mutations\/genes. Any genetic contribution to handedness in this unusual family is therefore likely to have a complex etiology, as at the population level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a5","authors":["Kavaklioglu, Tulya","Ajmal, Muhammad","Hameed, Abdul","Francks, Clyde"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropsychologia.2015.11.010","first_seen_on":"2015-11-18T04:17:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00283932","1873-3514"],"journal":"Neuropsychologia","last_mentioned_on":1448269096,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0028393215302256","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26581626?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26581626","pubdate":"2015-11-20T11:13:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"Whole exome sequencing for handedness in a large and highly consanguineous family.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/whole-exome-sequencing-handedness-large-highly-consanguineous-family"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6597995,"mean":6.1232477659116,"rank":1357303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5228936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6597995,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248792,"mean":9.277533536181,"rank":65181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":182920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248792,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2115,"mean":5.9692185430464,"rank":628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2115,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":7.6511081081081,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":4,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":2,"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MPI_NL\/statuses\/666832458881495040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4777367],"posted_on":"2015-11-18T04:17:02+00:00","author":{"name":"MaxPlanck-Psycholing","url":"http:\/\/www.mpi.nl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/890858600247283712\/D_oUWTaV_normal.jpg","description":"Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics | #language | Onderzoeksinstituut voor #taal, van genetica tot gedrag |","id_on_source":"MPI_NL","tweeter_id":"2589476659","geo":{"lt":51.8425,"ln":5.85278,"country":"NL"},"followers":2531},"tweet_id":"666832458881495040"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rctatman\/statuses\/666860974129811456","license":"gnip","rt":["MPI_NL"],"citation_ids":[4777367],"posted_on":"2015-11-18T06:10:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Rachael Tatman","url":"http:\/\/rachaeltatman.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/858109555506528257\/K0dUBw0w_normal.jpg","description":"Data Preparation Analyst @kaggle & Linguistics PhD.
