The algorithm exploits the sparseness and\/or symmetry of matrices to simplify the computational procedure. Thus plenty of invalid operations can be avoided by offline derivation using a block matrix technique. For enhanced efficiency, a new parallel computational mechanism is established by subdividing and restructuring calculation processes after analyzing the extracted \"useful\" data. As a result, the algorithm saves about 90% of the CPU processing time and 66% of the memory usage needed in a classical Kalman filter. Meanwhile, the method as a numerical approach needs no precise-loss transformation\/approximation of system modules and the accuracy suffers little in comparison with the filter before computational optimization. Furthermore, since no complicated matrix theories are needed, the algorithm can be easily transplanted into other modified filters as a secondary optimization method to achieve further efficiency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Shaoxing Hu"],"doi":"10.3390\/s151128402","first_seen_on":"2015-11-17T22:03:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"11","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1447797803,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/15\/11\/28402\/htm"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/15\/11\/28402\/pdf","pmid":"26569247","pubdate":"2015-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Optimization Algorithm for Kalman Filter Exploiting the Numerical Characteristics of SINS\/GPS Integrated Navigation Systems","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimization-algorithm-kalman-filter-exploiting-numerical-characteristics-sinsgps-integrated-navigat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6577121,"mean":6.1012807651375,"rank":3127339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1963585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6577121,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247791,"mean":9.2806349166633,"rank":129892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":91525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247791,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1872,"mean":2.007583110636,"rank":651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1872,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":2.4779797979798,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2,"Psychology":1,"Computer Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AR":1},"mendeley":{"CN":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LCR_UTN\/statuses\/666738429191979008","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4776139],"posted_on":"2015-11-17T22:03:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Rodrigo Gonzalez","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/rodralez\/navego","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/597224145592709120\/5lhgFt3e_normal.jpg","description":"Ph.D. Assistant Professor at UTN.
