Extrapolating from the 11.5% incidence rate of HIV-infected newborns in 1997, we projected the number of cases of MTCT of HIV that were averted over the 16-year period. A published estimate of lifetime HIV treatment costs was used to estimate HIV treatment costs saved from the averted infections; expenditures for clinical protocols and other services directly associated with preventing MTCT of HIV were also estimated. The ROI was then calculated by dividing program benefits by the expenditures incurred to achieve these benefits.\nWe estimate that 898 cases of MTCT of HIV were averted between 1998 and 2013, resulting in a savings of $321.03 million in HIV treatment costs. Expenditures to achieve these benefits totaled $81.07 million, yielding a ROI of $3.96.\nAside from the human suffering from MTCT of HIV that is averted, expenditures for treatment protocols and interventions to prevent MTCT of HIV are relatively inexpensive and can result in almost four times their value in HIV treatment cost savings realized.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c37","authors":["Laufer, Franklin N","Warren, Barbara L","Pulver, Wendy P","Smith, Lou C","Wright, Rodney L","Birkhead, Guthrie S","Laufer, Franklin N.","Warren, Barbara L.","Pulver, Wendy P.","Smith, Lou C.","Wright, Rodney L.","Birkhead, Guthrie S."],"doi":"10.1097\/qai.0000000000000899","first_seen_on":"2015-11-17T19:27:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-4135","1531-2291","1944-7884"],"issue":"5","journal":"JAIDS: Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes","last_mentioned_on":1462872225,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jaids\/9000\/00000\/Return_on_Investment_from_Expenditures_Incurred_to.97370.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jaids\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Return_on_Investment_from_Expenditures_Incurred_to.97370.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26974414","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jaids\/pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=04150&article=00014&type=abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jaids\/9000\/00000\/Return_on_Investment_from_Expenditures_Incurred_to.97370.pdf","pmid":"26569543","pubdate":"2015-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Return on Investment from Expenditures Incurred to Eliminate Mother-to-Child Transmission Among HIV-Infected Women in New York State: 1998-2013.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jaids\/Fulltext\/2016\/04150\/Return_on_Investment_From_Expenditures_Incurred_to.14.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/return-investment-expenditures-incurred-eliminate-mothertochild-transmission-among-hivinfected-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8460391,"mean":7.1076606534604,"rank":1944241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6500601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8460391,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298293,"mean":9.0005683692487,"rank":75762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":221717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298293,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2507,"mean":4.0660367118915,"rank":590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2507,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":1.8058823529412,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Psychology":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":3},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/journalaids\/statuses\/666665641689001985","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4773992],"posted_on":"2015-11-17T17:14:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Journal of AIDS","url":"http:\/\/www.jaids.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/828741468932161537\/L5hup48i_normal.jpg","description":"JAIDS: Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes is the trusted, interdisciplinary resource for HIV- and AIDS-related information.","id_on_source":"journalaids","tweeter_id":"334232510","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":443},"tweet_id":"666665641689001985"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ViiVHC\/statuses\/669893403610517506","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4773992],"posted_on":"2015-11-26T15:00:08+00:00","author":{"name":"ViiV Healthcare","url":"http:\/\/www.viivhealthcare.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/887970855560425477\/3PnZXD_B_normal.jpg","description":"Official feed for ViiV Healthcare, 100% focused on working with the #HIV community.
