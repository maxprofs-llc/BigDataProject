Self-inflicted injuries to the gingiva are rare and their management by periodontal therapy alone is inadequate. Proper management of this condition requires early detection and effective psychological treatment through behavioral therapy in addition to the treatment of dental lesion. Three male patients in their twenties presented with traumatic injuries of gingiva with history of self-injury and underlying emotional disturbances. Following basic periodontal intervention, their self-inflicting behavior was confirmed on psychiatric consultation. All of them underwent cognitive behavior therapy and were able to successfully curb their self-inflicting behavior prior to any definitive dental procedures. These cases illustrate the essentiality of behavioral intervention in addition to periodontal procedures in the management of such lesions.","altmetric_jid":"56e8230b2a83eea2188b4573","authors":["Pattnaik, Naina"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/678504","first_seen_on":"2015-11-18T14:51:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090-6447"],"journal":"Case Reports in Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1447858247,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/crid\/2015\/678504\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/crid\/2015\/678504.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4667073","pmid":"26664762","pubdate":"2015-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Interdisciplinary Management of Gingivitis Artefacta Major: A Case Series","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interdisciplinary-management-gingivitis-artefacta-major-case-series"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6581713,"mean":6.1066319197804,"rank":5615381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6581713,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248218,"mean":9.2789449795945,"rank":196340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248218,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":1.2827927927928,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.4785714285714,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/666991948637454336","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4778770],"posted_on":"2015-11-18T14:50:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"666991948637454336"}]}}
