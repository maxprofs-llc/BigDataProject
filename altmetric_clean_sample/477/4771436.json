Many previous studies have not distinguished between genders.\nIn this nationwide study we compared quality of life, anxiety, and depression symptoms between the genders in ICD recipients, and determined predictors of each of these variables in men and women. All adult Swedish ICD recipients were invited by mail to participate and 2,771 patients (66 \u00b1 12 years) completed standardized measures of quality of life, symptoms of anxiety, and depression. Time since implantation ranged from 1 year to 23 years with a mean of 4.7 \u00b1 3.9.\nWomen reported worse quality of life (mean index 0.790 vs 0.825) and higher prevalence of anxiety (20.5% vs 14.7%) than did men (P < 0.001 for both comparisons), while there were no differences in symptoms of depression (8.8% vs 8.2%).\nMost ICD recipients report a good quality of life, without emotional distress, but among the minority with distress, women fare worse than men.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000327d","authors":["MILLER, JENNIFER L.","THYL\u00c9N, INGELA","Moser, Debra K.","MOSER, DEBRA K."],"doi":"10.1111\/pace.12786","endpage":"159","first_seen_on":"2015-11-17T14:05:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1540-8159"],"issue":"2","journal":"Pacing & Clinical Electrophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1447758585,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/pace.12786"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pace.12786\/pdf","pmid":"26856629","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"149","subjects":["physiology","cardiology"],"title":"Gender Disparities in Symptoms of Anxiety, Depression and Quality of Life in Defibrillator Recipients","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gender-disparities-symptoms-anxiety-depression-quality-life-defibrillator-recipients-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6577121,"mean":6.1012807651375,"rank":3102186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3449788,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6577121,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247791,"mean":9.2806464183381,"rank":128447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":117898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247791,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":384,"mean":2.1733472584856,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":384,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.84090909090909,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TullyJodi\/statuses\/666573935748739072","license":"gnip","rt":["psych2evidence"],"citation_ids":[4771436],"posted_on":"2015-11-17T11:09:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Jodi","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/767865381021188097\/1_0beCUX_normal.jpg","description":"What saves a man is to take a step.
