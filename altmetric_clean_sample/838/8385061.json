The teeth can be lost due to external root resorption. The aim of this study was to histologically assess of the effect of laser phototherapy (\u03bb780 nm) on replanted teeth in rats.\nSixty Wistar Albinus rats had their maxillary right incisors extracted and were then divided into four groups: G1-absence of storage medium; G2-milk as storage medium; G3-milk as storage medium followed by a laser irradiation of the root surfaces and entrance of the alveolus (\u03bb = 780 nm; P = 70 mW; CW; DE = 21 J\/cm(2) ); G4-milk as storage medium, laser irradiation as in G3 before replantation. After this procedure, laser irradiation was performed on the buccal and palatal mucosa (8.4 J\/cm(2) per session) every 48 h for 15 days. The animals were euthanized 15, 30, and 60 days after replantation.\nThe histological results showed that after 15 days, G4 exhibited intense chronic inflammation with the presence of clastic cells and moderate external inflammatory root resorption (P < 0.05) when compared with G3, in which these outcomes were not observed. At the 30th day, G1, G2, and G4 showed chronic inflammation varying from discrete to moderate, as well as intense external inflammatory root resorption. G3 remained without any inflammation and external inflammatory root resorption up to the 60th day.\nThe use of laser phototherapy on the root surface and at the entrance of the alveolus prior to replantation had a positive biomodulative effect on alveolar repair after tooth replantation in rats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026da","authors":["Carvalho, Fab\u00edola Bastos","Andrade, Aline Silva","Barbosa, Artur Felipe dos Santos","Aguiar, M\u00e1rcio Cajazeira","Cangussu, Maria Cristina Teixeira","Pinheiro, Ant\u00f4nio Luiz Barbosa","Ramalho, Luciana Maria Pedreira"],"doi":"10.1111\/edt.12289","endpage":"494","first_seen_on":"2016-05-31T05:22:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1600-9657"],"issue":"6","journal":"Dental Traumatology","last_mentioned_on":1464681507,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/edt.12289&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/edt.12289\/pdf","pmid":"27242245","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"488","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Evaluation of laser phototherapy (\u03bb 780 nm) after dental replantation in rats","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-laser-phototherapy-780-nm-after-dental-replantation-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":3817065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3958409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269297,"mean":11.365250497593,"rank":131094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":135432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269297,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":396,"mean":1.7822632911392,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":396,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.0475,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
