Either way, the paper is great #nih"],"citation":{"abstract":"This review discusses the major contributors to the subtle magnetic properties of brain tissue and how they affect MRI contrast. With the increased availability of high-field scanners, the use of magnetic susceptibility contrast for the study of human brain anatomy and function has increased dramatically. This has not only led to novel applications, but has also improved our understanding of the complex relationship between MRI contrast and magnetic susceptibility. Chief contributors to the magnetic susceptibility of brain tissue have been found to include myelin as well as iron. In the brain, iron exists in various forms with diverse biological roles, many of which are now only starting to be uncovered. An interesting aspect of magnetic susceptibility contrast is its sensitivity to the microscopic distribution of iron and myelin, which provides opportunities to extract information at spatial scales well below MRI resolution. For example, in white matter, the myelin sheath that surrounds the axons can provide tissue contrast that is dependent on the axonal orientation and reflects the relative size of intra- and extra-axonal water compartments. The extraction of such ultrastructural information, together with quantitative information about iron and myelin concentrations, is an active area of research geared towards the characterization of brain structure and function, and their alteration in disease.
