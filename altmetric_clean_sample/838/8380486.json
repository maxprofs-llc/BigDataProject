Thanks to its unique characteristics, mRNA can act not only as a source for antigen but also as an adjuvant for activation of the immune system. The search for additional adjuvants that can be combined with mRNA to further improve the potency of the immunization revealed Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)\u00a0ligand as a potent candidate. Systemic administration of the dendritic cell-activating FLT3 ligand prior to or along with mRNA immunization-enhanced priming and expansion of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in lymphoid organs, T-cell homing into melanoma tumors, and therapeutic activity of the intranodally administered mRNA. Both compounds demonstrate a successful combination in terms of boosting the immune response. This chapter describes methods for intranodal immunization with naked mRNA by co-administration of FLT3 ligand, which leads to strong synergistic effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Kreiter, Sebastian","Diken, Mustafa","Selmi, Abderraouf","Petschenka, Jutta","T\u00fcreci, \u00d6zlem","Sahin, Ugur"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-3625-0_11","first_seen_on":"2016-05-30T21:22:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-6029","1064-3745"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1464832468,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27236799?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27236799"],"pmid":"27236799","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Synthetic mRNA","type":"article","volume":"1428","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/flt3-ligand-molecular-adjuvant-naked-rna-vaccines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":757712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7058078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269241,"mean":11.36270569009,"rank":38748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":229510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269241,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5529,"mean":1.8878560057887,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":5335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5529,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.0391428571429,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
