The additional budget required for the UNAIDS target strategy would be $7.965 billion over 5 years and $15.979 billion over 10 years, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2720 and $1260 per year of life saved, respectively.\nOutcomes generally varied less than 20% from base-case outcomes when key input parameters were varied within plausible ranges.\nSeveral pathways may lead to 73% overall virologic suppression; these were examined in sensitivity analyses.\nReaching the 90-90-90 HIV suppression target would be costly but very effective and cost-effective in South Africa. Global health policymakers should mobilize the political and economic support to realize this target.\nNational Institutes of Health and the Steve and Deborah Gorlin MGH Research Scholars Award.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000227a","authors":["Rochelle P.
