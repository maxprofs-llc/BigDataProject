Saline (0.4\u00a0mL\u00a0kg(-1)) was injected in control animals. Sensory nerve blockade was evaluated by scoring cutaneous sensation in targeted nerves. Motor nerve blockade was evaluated based on weight bearing, conscious proprioception and withdrawal reflex scores. Times to execute the technique in UNB and ENB were compared using t tests (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Scores for sensory and motor nerve blockades in each treatment were compared with scores before treatment and with control treatment scores using nonparametric repeated-measures two-way analysis of variance. Time to onset and duration of sensory nerve block were assessed using scores for four sensory nerve functions. A successful sensory nerve block was defined by decreases in scores for these functions. Success rates of nerve blocks were compared among treatments using McNemar's test.\nIn UNB and ENB, onset times of sensory nerve blocks were 1 hour and 1.5 hours, respectively. Onset times of motor nerve blocks were 0.5 hour in both treatments. In UNB and ENB, durations of sensory nerve block were 3 hours and 0.5 hour, respectively, and durations of motor nerve block were 7.5 hours and 6.5 hours, respectively. Success rates did not differ between the techniques.\nThe UNB brachial plexus block had a shorter onset time and longer duration than ENB. UNB can be performed in conscious dogs or those under mild sedation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f7","authors":["Minori Akasaka","Miki Shimizu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vaa.2016.08.001","first_seen_on":"2017-01-12T14:32:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["14672987","1467-2995"],"journal":"Veterinary Anaesthesia & Analgesia","last_mentioned_on":1501094040,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1467298717300259","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28624495?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28624495\/?i=5&from=anesthesia%20dog","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.vaa.2016.08.001"],"pmid":"28624495","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Comparison of ultrasound- and electrostimulation-guided nerve blocks of brachial plexus in dogs","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-ultrasound-electrostimulationguided-nerve-blocks-brachial-plexus-dogs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8277330,"mean":6.982694453965,"rank":3796343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4398130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8277330,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269859,"mean":12.527461894774,"rank":123362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":142565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269859,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":512,"mean":1.0480430528376,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":512,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":0.6445652173913,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/819552434800525312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15413696],"posted_on":"2017-01-12T14:31:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2115},"tweet_id":"819552434800525312"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/876742079954657280","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15413696],"posted_on":"2017-06-19T10:02:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
