The aim of this study was to investigate whether LA reservoir strain by speckle-tracking echocardiography, as a measure of LA compliance, is impaired in patients with CS and no history of atrial fibrillation.\nA retrospective case-control study of 742 patients (mean age, 59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0years; 54% men; 371 with CS and 371 control subjects) was conducted. LA reservoir strain was quantified using speckle-tracking echocardiography.\nLA strain was significantly lower among patients with CS than control subjects (30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3% vs 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Current smoking (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% CI, 1.7-4.0; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.17 per 10\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg increase; 95% CI, 1.06-1.29; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), antihypertensive treatment (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.30-0.66; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), larger indexed left ventricular end-systolic volume (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P\u00a0=\u00a0.02), higher E\/E' ratio (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P\u00a0=\u00a0.01), mitral regurgitation (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7; P\u00a0=\u00a0.003), and lower LA reservoir strain (OR, 1.07 per 1% reduction; 95% CI, 1.05-1.10; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) were independently associated with CS. Importantly, LA reservoir strain conferred incremental discriminatory value in the identification of patients with CS (likelihood ratio P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).\nSubtle LA dysfunction, as assessed by LA reservoir strain with speckle-tracking echocardiography, is associated with CS independent of other cardiovascular risk factors. These findings suggest a potential role for LA strain to risk-stratify patients in the prevention of stroke.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ac0","authors":["Leong, Darryl P","Joyce, Emer","Debonnaire, Philippe","Katsanos, Spyridon","Holman, Eduard R","Schalij, Martin J","Bax, Jeroen J","Delgado, Victoria","Marsan, Nina Ajmone"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.echo.2016.09.013","first_seen_on":"2017-01-12T11:39:31+00:00","issns":["1097-6795"],"journal":"Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1484221153,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27843104"],"pmid":"27843104","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Left Atrial Dysfunction in the Pathogenesis of Cryptogenic Stroke: Novel Insights from Speckle-Tracking Echocardiography.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/left-atrial-dysfunction-pathogenesis-cryptogenic-stroke-novel-insights-speckletracking-echocardiogra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063599,"mean":6.8425680134317,"rank":4263840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2237039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063599,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255059,"mean":12.788234213394,"rank":144037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":86077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255059,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":491,"mean":2.9723918367347,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":491,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.6035714285714,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
