However, it is still unclear which high-level brain areas are involved and how they interact with low-level brain areas. Further, the temporal range over which perceptual expectation can effectively attenuate repetition suppression effects remains unclear. To elucidate the details of this top-down modulatory process, we used two short and long inter-stimulus intervals for a perceptual expectation paradigm of paired stimulation. We found that top-down modulation enhanced the response to the unexpected stimulus when repetition suppression was weak and that the effect disappeared at 1,000\u2009ms prior to stimulus exposure. The high-level areas involved in this process included the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG_L) and left parietal lobule (IPL_L). We also found two systems providing modulatory input to the right fusiform face area (FFA_R): one from IFG_L and the other from IPL_L. Most importantly, we identified two states of networks through which perceptual expectation modulates sensory responses: one is a dynamic state and the other is a steady state. Our results provide the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence of temporally nested networks in brain processing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Uk-Su Choi","Yul-Wan Sung","Seiji Ogawa"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep40626","first_seen_on":"2017-01-12T16:30:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1484237683,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep40626"],"pmid":"28079163","pubdate":"2017-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cognitive control","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Perception","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"40626","subjects":["science"],"title":"Steady-state and dynamic network modes for perceptual expectation","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/steadystate-dynamic-network-modes-perceptual-expectation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063599,"mean":6.8425680134317,"rank":6982223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063599,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255058,"mean":12.788291409371,"rank":210538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255058,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32709,"mean":14.962627247157,"rank":27714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32709,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3248,"mean":16.297788728057,"rank":2666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3248,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/uranus_2\/statuses\/819578362972618753","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15415970],"posted_on":"2017-01-12T16:14:43+00:00","author":{"name":"\u30de\u30fc\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\uff12\u4e16","url":"http:\/\/smetc.blog120.fc2.com\/?sp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/650483455248064512\/EOJq3sZX_normal.png","description":"\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3068\u3082\u5927\u5b66\u521d\u5e74\u6b21\u307e\u3067\u306f\u5834\u9762\u7dd8\u9ed9\u75c7\uff08\u81ea\u5df1\u8a3a\u65ad\uff09\u3060\u3063\u305f\u7537\u3002Twitter\u307e\u3068\u3081(http:\/\/psychobrain.seesaa.net\/)\u3002 \u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805\u2460\u8ad6\u6587\u306f\u8981\u7d04\u3057\u304b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u306a\u3044\u5834\u5408\u304c\u591a\u3044\u2461\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u2462\u79c1\u306f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002","id_on_source":"uranus_2","tweeter_id":"253847599","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3417},"tweet_id":"819578362972618753"}]}}
