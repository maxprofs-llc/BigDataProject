Multidrug resistance (MDR) in Gram-negative bacteria is often ascribed to the presence of multiple and different resistance mechanisms in the same strain. RND efflux pumps play a major role and are an attractive target to discover new antibacterial drugs. Areas covered: This review discusses the prevalence of efflux pumps, their overexpression in clinical scenarios, their polyselectivity, their effect on the intracellular concentrations of various antibiotics associated with the alteration of the membrane permeability and their involvement in pathogenicity are discussed. Expert Opinion: Efflux pumps are new targets for the development of adjuvant in antibiotic treatments by of efflux pump inhibition. They may allow us to rejuvenate old antibiotics acting on their concentration inside the bacteria and thus potentiating their activity while blocking the release of virulence factors. It is a pharmacodynamic challenge to finalize new combined therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c2","authors":["Alibert, Sandrine","N'Gompazza Diarra, Joannah","Hernandez, Jessica","Stutzmann, Aur\u00e9lien","Fouad, Marwa","Boyer, G\u00e9rard","Pag\u00e8s, Jean-Marie","Sandrine Alibert"],"doi":"10.1080\/17425255.2017.1251581","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2016-10-22T07:15:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-7607","1742-5255"],"journal":"Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1478477302,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27764576","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17425255.2017.1251581?ai=1lm3u&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"27764576","pubdate":"2016-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Multidrug efflux pumps and their role in antibiotic and antiseptic resistance: A pharmacodynamic perspective","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multidrug-efflux-pumps-role-antibiotic-antiseptic-resistance-pharmacodynamic-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7659635,"mean":6.5812991774756,"rank":3742794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3721762,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7659635,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238605,"mean":12.584644314429,"rank":120975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":108999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238605,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":692,"mean":1.6654037626628,"rank":267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":692,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":0.7974358974359,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
