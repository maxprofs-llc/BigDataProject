Not a study, but it suggests that amygdala connectivity relates to extraversion\/neuroticism"],"citation":{"abstract":"The amygdala plays a key role in emotion processing. Its functional connectivity with other brain regions has been extensively demonstrated to be associated with extraversion and neuroticism. However, how the amygdala affects other regions and is affected by others within these connectivity patterns associated with extraversion and neuroticism remains unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the effective connectivity of the amygdala using Granger causality analysis on the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 70 participants. Results showed that extraversion was positively correlated with the influence from the right inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) to the left amygdala, and from the bilateral IOG to the right amygdala; such result may represent the neural correlates of social interactions in extraverts. Conversely, neuroticism was associated with an increased influence from right amygdala to right middle frontal gyrus and a decreased influence from right precuneus to right amygdala. This influence might affect the modulations of cognitive regulation function and self-referential processes in neurotic individuals. These findings highlight the importance of the causal influences of amygdala in explaining the individual differences in extraversion and neuroticism, and offer further insights into the specific neural networks underlying personality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yajing Pang","Qian Cui","Yifeng Wang","Yuyan Chen","Xiaona Wang","Shaoqiang Han","Zhiqiang Zhang","Guangming Lu","Huafu Chen"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep35484","first_seen_on":"2016-10-22T06:15:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1504548523,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep35484","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/srep35484","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep35484?WT.feed_name=subjects_neuroscience"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep35484.pdf","pmid":"27765947","pubdate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Amygdala","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Human behaviour","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"35484","subjects":["science"],"title":"Extraversion and neuroticism related to the resting-state effective connectivity of amygdala","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extraversion-neuroticism-related-restingstate-effective-connectivity-amygdala"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360463,"mean":7.0503912403329,"rank":3480733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4834515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360463,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248615,"mean":12.805189048082,"rank":97886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":148758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248615,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36870,"mean":14.721233448154,"rank":14759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":21815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36870,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3115,"mean":16.483501605652,"rank":1421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3115,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
