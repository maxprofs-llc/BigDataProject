Subjects were assigned to the severe hypoxemia group (24 cases), mild-moderate hypoxemia group (91 cases) on the basis of PaO2. The psychological aspects of subjects were assessed by using the Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (MMPI).\nCompared between OSAHS group and the control group, differences of 6 clinical scales depression (D), hysteria (Hy), masculinity (Mf), paranoia (Pa), anxiety (A), ego strength (Es) were significant (t value was 2.609, 2.133, -2.294, 2.520, 2.041, 2.675 respectively, all P < 0.05). The scores of OSAHS group were higher than the control group on five clinical scales, depression (D), hysteria (Hy), paranoia (Pa), anxiety (A), ego strength (ES). The scores of OSAHS group were lower than the control group on clinical scale masculinity (Mf). Compared between severe OSAHS group and mild-moderate OSAHS group, differences of 6 clinical scales depression (D), paranoia (Pa), psychasthenia (Pt) anxiety (A), manifest anxiety scale (MAS), dependency (Dy) were significant (t value was 2.460, 2.086, 2.181, 2.121, 2.954, 1.982, respectively). The scores of severe OSAHS group were all higher than the mild-moderate OSAHS group on these six clinical scales. Compared between severe hypoxemia group and the contrast group, differences of 4 clinical scales depression (D), masculinity (Mf), paranoia (Pa), ego strength (Es) were significant (t value was respectively 2.992, -2.221, 2.164, 2.165, all P < 0.05). The scores of severe hypoxemia group were higher than the control group on 3 clinical scales, depression (D), paranoia (Pa), ego strength (ES), and lower than the control group on clinical scale masculinity (Mf). Compared between severe hypoxemia group and mild-moderate hypoxemia group, psychasthenia (Pt) were significant (t value was 1.984). The scores of severe hypoxemia group were higher.\nCompared with health people, OSAHS patients have special personality and character. The degree of OSAHS can infect the personality and character of OSAHS patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9213cf058f61000d8b1","authors":["Li, Yaojun","Wang, Wei","Lin, Peng","Lu, Honghua","Zhang, Yuan","Li, Qianwei","Zhang, Ziyue"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T10:20:32+00:00","issns":["1673-0860"],"issue":"7","journal":"Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery","last_mentioned_on":1467921065,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26695984?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26695984","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"[Study on the psychologic status and personality traits of patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome].","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-psychologic-status-personality-traits-patients-obstructive-sleep-apnea-hypopnea-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019832,"mean":6.784478957969,"rank":6940551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019832,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259499,"mean":11.524640428828,"rank":218027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259499,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":0.67067901234568,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.7,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/751141508598738944","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9336594],"posted_on":"2016-07-07T19:51:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":415},"tweet_id":"751141508598738944"}]}}
