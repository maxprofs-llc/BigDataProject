A gene encoding RING finger protein 186 (RNF186) is located within UC-susceptible loci. However, it is unclear whether RNF186 is involved in IBD pathogenesis. Here, we show that RNF186 controls protein homeostasis in colonic epithelia and regulates intestinal inflammation. RNF186, which was highly expressed in colonic epithelia, acted as an E3 ligase mediating polyubiquitination of its substrates. Permeability of small organic molecules was augmented in the intestine of Rnf186(-\/-) mice. Increased expression of several RNF186 substrates, such as occludin, was found in Rnf186(-\/-) colonic epithelia. The disturbed protein homeostasis in Rnf186(-\/-) mice correlated with enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in colonic epithelia and increased sensitivity to intestinal inflammation after dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment. Introduction of an UC-associated Rnf186 mutation led to impaired E3 ligase activity and increased sensitivity to DSS-induced intestinal inflammation in mice. Thus, RNF186 maintains gut homeostasis by controlling ER stress in colonic epithelia.Mucosal Immunology advance online publication 6 July 2016. doi:10.1038\/mi.2016.58.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000423d","authors":["Kosuke Fujimoto","Makoto Kinoshita","Hiroo Tanaka","Daisuke Okuzaki","Yosuke Shimada","Hisako Kayama","Ryu Okumura","Yoki Furuta","Masashi Narazaki","Atsushi Tamura","Shigetsugu Hatakeyama","Masahito Ikawa","Kiichiro Tsuchiya","Mamoru Watanabe","Atsushi Kumanogoh","Sachiko Tsukita","Kiyoshi Takeda"],"doi":"10.1038\/mi.2016.58","first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T10:12:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1935-3456","1933-0219"],"journal":"Mucosal Immunology (1933-0219)","last_mentioned_on":1468690816,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/mi\/rss\/aop\/~3\/cj3UobaJFAM\/mi.2016.58","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/mi\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/mi201658a.html"],"pmid":"27381925","pubdate":"2016-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Regulation of intestinal homeostasis by the ulcerative colitis-associated gene RNF186","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-intestinal-homeostasis-ulcerative-colitisassociated-gene-rnf186"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078414,"mean":6.8578859978971,"rank":6993284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078414,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259682,"mean":11.583211109014,"rank":217591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259682,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":613,"mean":6.3020751633987,"rank":548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":613,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":7.2655555555556,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
