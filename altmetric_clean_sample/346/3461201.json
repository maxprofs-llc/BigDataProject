These genes are induced rapidly by androgens\/growth factors and may have functions related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. To investigate the TR3 orphan receptor gene transcriptional regulation, a 2.3-kilobase genomic DNA fragment containing the TR3 orphan receptor gene promoter region was isolated, sequenced, and characterized. Sequence homology search within this promoter region revealed some potential cis-acting elements such as cAMP response element, interleukin-6 response element, estrogen response element, and GC box. Deletion analysis and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay also showed a novel cis-acting element of TR3 orphan receptor gene (NCAE-TR3), 200-181 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. Gel retardation assay further demonstrated that some nuclear factors can bind to this NCAE-TR3. Together, our data suggest that NCAE-TR3 could be a new enhancer element associated with the transcription of an early response gene for mitogenesis and apoptosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["H Uemura","A Mizokami","C Chang"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T16:35:03+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1195512646,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7890657"],"pmid":"7890657","pubdate":"1995-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Identification of a new enhancer in the promoter region of human TR3 orphan receptor gene.
