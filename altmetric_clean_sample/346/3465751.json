We report the cloning and characterization of two novel proteins that are splice isoforms of the caspase-10 family. Caspase-10\/c is a truncated protein that is essentially a prodomain-only form of the caspase that lacks proteolytic activity in vitro but efficiently induces the formation of perinuclear filamentous structures and cell death in vivo. Caspase-10\/c mRNA is specifically up-regulated upon TNF stimulation, suggesting a potential role of this isoform in amplifying the apoptotic response to extracellular stimuli such as cytokines. Caspase-10\/d is a hybrid of the known caspases Mch4 and FLICE2, as it is identical to FLICE2 except for the small (p12) catalytic subunit, which is identical to Mch4. Caspase-10\/d is proteolytically active in vitro and also induces cell death in vivo, although it is less active than Mch4. The mRNAs for all known isoforms of caspase-10 are abundantly expressed in fetal lung, kidney, and skeletal muscle but are very poorly expressed or absent in these tissues in the adult, implying a possible role for the caspase-10 family in fetal development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Patrick W.
