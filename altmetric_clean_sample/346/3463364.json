Its gene on chromosome 5q12 encodes 5 splice variants, which show tissue-dependent expression and regulation. The genomic arrangement of PDE4D was determined using in silico methods, and a putative promoter of one of the protein kinase A-activated, long isoforms, PDE4D5 was identified. Promoter-luciferase constructs, transiently transfected into a beta(2) adrenoreceptor-expressing CHO-K1 cell line, were used to demonstrate that the PDE4D5 promoter up-regulated reporter gene expression in response to increased cell cAMP. Site-directed mutagenesis of the cAMP-response element (CRE) at position -201 identified this as the principal component of the mechanism underlying this cAMP responsiveness. In the second part of this study, cAMP-dependent induction of PDE4D5 transcript in primary cultured human airway smooth muscle cells (hASMs) was demonstrated using both qualitative reverse-transcriptase PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Isolated PDE4D5 isoenzyme activity, measured after selective immunoprecipitation from hASMs, confirmed that this increase in expression led to an up-regulation of functional activity. We present evidence for cAMP-driven PDE4D5 up-regulation in hASMs and suggest a CRE-containing, isoform-specific promoter as the primary mechanism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Ivan R.
