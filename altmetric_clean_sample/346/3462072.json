The increase in luciferase activity that occurred when cells were either incubated in sterol-depleted medium or cotransfected with a cDNA encoding sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1a was prevented by coexpression of wild-type E1A or a Gal4-CBP (1-451) fusion protein. The inhibitory effect of E1A was overcome by coexpression of CBP. The increase in reporter gene activity noted above was not affected when the cells were cotransfected with cDNAs that encoded either a mutant E1A that is unable to interact with the transcriptional activator CBP or Gal4-CBP fusion proteins encoding separate fragments of CBP, which span the remainder of the CBP molecule. A preformed SREBP-1a:[32P]DNA complex bound specifically to membrane-immobilized GST-CBP fusion proteins that contained amino-terminal portions of CBP. In order to investigate the role of CBP in the regulation of endogenous genes, we isolated stable transformants that express Gal4-CBP(1-451) in response to added doxycycline. Induction of endogenous FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase mRNAs, in response to cellular cholesterol depletion, was prevented when cells expressed Gal4-CBP(1-451). We conclude that when cells are incubated in the absence of sterols, the transcriptional activation of the HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, FPP synthase, and low density lipoprotein receptor genes is dependent on a specific interaction between SREBP, which is bound to the promoter DNA, and the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1-451) of CBP.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["J Ericsson","P A Edwards"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T16:57:14+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"28","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1195076564,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9651391"],"pmid":"9651391","pubdate":"1998-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"CBP is required for sterol-regulated and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-regulated transcription.","type":"article","volume":"273","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cbp-required-sterolregulated-sterol-regulatory-element-binding-proteinregulated-transcription"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633425,"mean":4.921826751301,"rank":815866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633425,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96060,"mean":8.2401167615738,"rank":25079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96060,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28043,"mean":2.6367520861565,"rank":1751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":10016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28043,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4317520661157,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
