The interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) transduces non-redundant signals for both T and B-cell development from HSC. The upregulation of the IL-7R occurs at the stage of the clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor, a recently identified population that can give rise to all lymphoid lineages (T, B and natural killer cells) at a single cell level. The IL-7R plays a critical role in the rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes required for B-cell development. IL-7R expression is critically regulated in developing thymocytes; thymocytes that fail the positive selection process downregulate the IL-7R, but those undergoing positive selection upregulate or maintain IL-7R expression. Recent data indicate that IL-7 signaling enhances the survival of developing thymocytes and mature T cells, presumably by its upregulating Bcl-2. Detailed analysis of the signaling cascades activated by the IL-7R may help to reveal the differential roles of IL-7 signaling in T and B-cell development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a98","authors":["K Akashi","M Kondo","I L Weissman"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T18:18:35+00:00","issns":["0105-2896"],"journal":"Immunological Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1294321727,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9850848"],"pmid":"9850848","pubdate":"1998-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Role of interleukin-7 in T-cell development from hematopoietic stem cells.","type":"article","volume":"165","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-interleukin7-tcell-development-hematopoietic-stem-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991404,"mean":5.0365276857663,"rank":917473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2527542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991404,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126858,"mean":9.1228837561293,"rank":38590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126858,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":455,"mean":2.3911453744493,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":455,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.7875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
