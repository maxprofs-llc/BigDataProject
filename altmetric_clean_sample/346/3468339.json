The restriction endonuclease map, in comparison with the previously published sequences of the human ODC gene, indicated that hODC41B contained a 15.7-kb sequence that extended from the sixth exon to about 10 kb upstream of the ODC gene. A 2.5-kb genomic fragment containing the 5' flanking region and the first exon was subcloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed multiple putative promoter\/enhancer elements (a TATA box, a CAAT box, 17 GC boxes, and a cAMP-responsive element) but no consensus AP-1 sequences (TGAGTCA) in the 2.5-kb 5' flanking region. However, three AP-1 sequences were located in introns 3, 5, and 11. We constructed a series of chimeric genes containing part of the first exon and increasingly longer 5' flanking sequences of the ODC gene fused to either bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or luciferase reporter genes. TPA inducibility was determined by transient transfection and measurement of CAT or luciferase expression in HeLa cells. The induction of CAT activity by TPA decreased with decreasing lengths of the 5' flanking sequences up to nt -82. The TPA induction from the construct -72 ODC CAT was threefold to sevenfold, and the TPA inducibility of the same fragment was about ninefold to 30-fold with the luciferase reporter gene. Further deletion analysis revealed TPA-responsive sequences in ODC nt -42 to +54. Gel mobility shift assays using alpha-32P-end labeled ODC nt -42 to +60 revealed that nt -42 to +60 specifically bound HeLa cell nuclear proteins. HeLa cell nuclear protein binding to ODC nt -42 to +60 could not be completely competed by AP-1-, AP-2-, AP-3-, or SP1-responsive sequences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e1","authors":["Y J Kim","H Pan","A K Verma"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T19:05:01+00:00","issns":["0899-1987"],"issue":"3","journal":"Molecular Carcinogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1195428682,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8043198"],"pmid":"8043198","pubdate":"1994-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"Non-AP-1 tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive sequences in the human ornithine decarboxylase gene.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonap1-tumor-promoter-12otetradecanoylphorbol13acetateresponsive-sequences-human-ornithine-decarboxy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620975,"mean":4.9297103293237,"rank":815880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2281475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620975,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93849,"mean":7.3274218949792,"rank":23832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93849,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288,"mean":1.7039303135889,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.9763157894737,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"ODC1","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=172376954#altmetric_citation_15","license":"public","citation_ids":[3468338,3468339],"posted_on":"2007-11-18T23:31:22+00:00","summary":"Ornithine decarboxylase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ODC1 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14166851","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
