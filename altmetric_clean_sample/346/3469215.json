This is because elevated basal FSH is associated with poorer assisted reproduction treatment outcome. It has been argued that high FSH reflects not only reduced ovarian reserve but also poor oocyte quality. The aim of this study is to assess the value of treating cycling women who have elevated basal FSH and to assess the reasons for the reduction in both pregnancy rate (PR) and live birth rate (LBR).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100072ea","authors":["H.
