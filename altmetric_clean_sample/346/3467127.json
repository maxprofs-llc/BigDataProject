We have cloned and sequenced the breakpoint in a patient with a t(14;19) and shown that the breakpoint on chromosome 14 occurred in the C mu switch region, and that the breakpoint on chromosome 19 occurred in the 5' untranslated region of the BCL3 gene. This is in contrast to all the other reported cases with a t(14;19) in which the breakpoints on chromosome 14 occurred in the C alpha 1 or C alpha 2 switch region, and the breakpoints on chromosome 19 occurred upstream of the BCL3 gene. Our results further emphasize the importance of the switch region in the t(14;19) translocation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007519","authors":["P E Crossen","M A Kennedy","D C Heaton","M J Morrison"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T18:40:14+00:00","issns":["1045-2257"],"issue":"1","journal":"Genes, Chromosomes, and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1195416087,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7691160"],"pmid":"7691160","pubdate":"1993-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"Cloning and sequencing of a t(14;19) breakpoint that involves the C mu switch region.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-sequencing-t1419-breakpoint-involves-c-mu-switch-region"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630432,"mean":4.9299514944696,"rank":816209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630432,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95605,"mean":8.1951772310784,"rank":24874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95605,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":2.0860793201133,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.45,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"BCL3","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=172336595#altmetric_citation_6","license":"public","citation_ids":[3467126,3467127],"posted_on":"2007-11-18T20:01:27+00:00","summary":"B-cell lymphoma 3-encoded protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BCL3 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14164436","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
