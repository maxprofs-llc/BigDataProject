Increased expression is mediated in part by the recruitment of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors alpha and gamma, together with estrogen-related receptor alpha, which functions through a novel binding site on the Ucp1 enhancer. This demonstrates that regulation of Ucp1 expression in the absence of RIP140 involves derepression of at least three different nuclear receptors. The ability to increase expression of Ucp1 by beta-adrenergic signaling is independent of RIP140, as shown by the action of the beta(3)-adrenergic agonist CL 316,243 to stimulate expression in both brown and white adipocytes in the presence and absence of the corepressor. Therefore, the expression of this metabolic uncoupling protein in adipose cells is regulated by inhibition as well as activation of distinct signaling pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e5","authors":["Darja Debevec"],"doi":"10.1210\/me.2007-0103","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T18:53:07+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Molecular Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1220246205,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1210\/me.2007-0103","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17456798","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2072047"],"pmcid":"PMC2072047","pmid":"17456798","pubdate":"2007-04-25T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","endocrinology"],"title":"Receptor Interacting Protein 140 Regulates Expression of Uncoupling Protein 1 in Adipocytes through Specific Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Isoforms and Estrogen-Related Receptor \u03b1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/receptor-interacting-protein-140-regulates-expression-uncoupling-protein-1-adipocytes-through-specif"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631524,"mean":4.926174121992,"rank":816076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631524,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95795,"mean":8.208787189177,"rank":24960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95795,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":928,"mean":2.4427529665588,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":928,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.328125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"NRIP1","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=235527159#altmetric_citation_22","license":"public","citation_ids":[3467774],"posted_on":"2008-09-01T05:16:45+00:00","summary":"Nuclear receptor-interacting protein 1 (NRIP1) also known as receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP140) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NRIP1 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14167435","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
