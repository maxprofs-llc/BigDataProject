Whereas the encoded proteins of the three genes share highly conserved regions distinct from other bZIP families such as Jun or Fos, remaining regions diverged considerably from each other. Chromosomal localization by fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrates that these genes are non-syntenic. p45-NF-E2 mapped to chromosome 12q13.1-13.3, whereas Nrf1 and 2 mapped to 17q21.3 and 2q31, respectively. However, these three genes were probably derived from a single ancestor by chromosomal duplication as other genes that also map in these regions are related to one another.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a0d","authors":["J Y Chan","M C Cheung","P Moi","K Chan","Y W Kan"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T17:18:27+00:00","issns":["0340-6717"],"issue":"3","journal":"Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1195086320,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7868116"],"pmid":"7868116","pubdate":"1995-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Chromosomal localization of the human NF-E2 family of bZIP transcription factors by fluorescence in situ hybridization.","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chromosomal-localization-human-nfe2-family-bzip-transcription-factors-fluorescence-situ-hybridizatio-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":816127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95749,"mean":8.2098489994571,"rank":24947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95749,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1753,"mean":3.3475947488584,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1753,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.0928571428571,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
