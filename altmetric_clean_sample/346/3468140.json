Three biologically important mutations in Usher syndrome type IIa patients were identified in a gene (USH2A) isolated from this critical region. The USH2A gene encodes a protein with a predicted size of 171.5 kilodaltons that has laminin epidermal growth factor and fibronectin type III motifs; these motifs are most commonly observed in proteins comprising components of the basal lamina and extracellular matrixes and in cell adhesion molecules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1998Sci...280.1753E","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["James D.
