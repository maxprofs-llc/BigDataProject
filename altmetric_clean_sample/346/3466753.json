We have localized the Pur alpha gene (PURA) to human chromosome band 5q31 by fluorescence in situ hybridization with a 16-kb genomic probe together with hybridization of a cDNA probe to blots of DNA from human-hamster cell lines containing individual human chromosomes. Sequences with homology to the PURA locus are also present at 6q14. The 5q31 locus is frequently deleted in myelogenous leukemia and other cancers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c3","authors":["Z W Ma","T Pejovic","V Najfeld","D C Ward","E M Johnson"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T18:32:29+00:00","issns":["0301-0171"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cytogenetics & Cell Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1195413656,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7606931"],"pmid":"7606931","pubdate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Localization of PURA, the gene encoding the sequence-specific single-stranded-DNA-binding protein Pur alpha, to chromosome band 5q31.","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/localization-pura-gene-encoding-sequencespecific-singlestrandeddnabinding-protein-pur-chromosome-ban"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95587,"mean":8.1943645094472,"rank":24866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95587,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":728,"mean":2.6440852819807,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":728,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"PURA","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=172328929#altmetric_citation_6","license":"public","citation_ids":[3466751,3466753],"posted_on":"2007-11-18T19:20:56+00:00","summary":"Transcriptional activator protein Pur-alpha is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PURA gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14162129","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
