The mouse numb (m-numb) gene encodes a membrane-associated protein that is asymmetrically localized to the apical cell membrane of dividing cortical progenitor cells and may be segregated to only the apical daughter cell that has been suggested to remain as a progenitor cell. To examine m-numb function during neural development, we generated a loss-of-function mutant allele of m-numb. Mice homozygous for this mutation exhibit severe defects in cranial neural tube closure and precocious neuron production in the forebrain and die around embryonic day 11.5 (E11. 5). These findings suggest that m-numb is an essential gene that plays a role in promoting progenitor cell fate during cortical neurogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2000PNAS...97.6844Z","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Weimin Zhong","Ming-Ming Jiang","Marcus D.
