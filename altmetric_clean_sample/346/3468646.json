We have detected RNAs capable of hybridizing to a rat stromelysin cDNA in 11 of 69 human tumours tested. Molecular cloning of cDNAs to these RNAs has identified them as a mixture of stromelysin RNA and a transcript of a hitherto-undescribed related human gene, the stromelysin-2 gene. We have also isolated cDNAs corresponding to a more distantly related new human gene, the pump-1 gene. A comparison of the cDNA-derived amino acid sequences of stromelysin-2 and pump-1 with the known sequences of stromelysin and collagenase reveals significant similarities, with conservation of sequence motifs believed to have functional importance in metalloproteinase action. We conclude that the collagenase gene family in humans consists of at least four members, and speculate that expression of these genes plays a role in cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["D Muller","B Quantin","M C Gesnel","R Millon-Collard","J Abecassis","R Breathnach"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T19:11:11+00:00","issns":["0264-6021"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochemical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1367999304,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2844164","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1149273"],"pmcid":"PMC1149273","pmid":"2844164","pubdate":"1988-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The collagenase gene family in humans consists of at least four members.","type":"article","volume":"253","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/collagenase-gene-family-humans-consists-least-four-members"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":817889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94770,"mean":8.1006834935475,"rank":24525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94770,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3760,"mean":2.4099898909284,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3760,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.7214285714286,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"PT":1,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"MMP10","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=172450710#altmetric_citation_6","license":"public","citation_ids":[3468646],"posted_on":"2007-11-19T08:17:11+00:00","summary":"Stromelysin-2 also known as matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP-10) or transin-2 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MMP10 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14171158","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}},{"title":"Stromelysin 2","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=554092793#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3468646],"posted_on":"2013-05-08T07:41:50+00:00","summary":"This enzyme belongs to the peptidase family M10 (interstitial collagenase family).","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=39333376","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Dcirovic","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Dcirovic"}},{"title":"Matrilysin","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=554093507#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3468646],"posted_on":"2013-05-08T07:48:24+00:00","summary":"This enzyme is present in rat uterus.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=39333410","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Dcirovic","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Dcirovic"}}]}}
