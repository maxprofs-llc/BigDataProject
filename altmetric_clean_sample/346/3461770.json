Here we show that the GPCR kinase-interacting protein-1 (GIT1) is a substrate for c-Src that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to angiotensin II (AngII) and EGF in vascular smooth muscle and 293 cells. GIT1 associates with PLCgamma via the PLCgamma Src homology 2 and 3 domains constitutively, and the interaction is unaltered by AngII and EGF. GIT1 interaction with PLCgamma is required for PLCgamma activation based on inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium mobilization after GIT1 knockdown with antisense GIT1 oligonucleotides. GIT1 interacts with PLCgamma via a novel Spa homology domain (SHD) and a coiled-coil domain. Deletion mutation analysis showed that GIT1(SHD) is required for AngII- and EGF-mediated PLCgamma activation (measured by phosphorylation of Tyr783 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation). We propose that GIT1 is a novel regulator of PLCgamma function that mediates PLCgamma activation by c-Src and integrates signal transduction by GPCRs and TKRs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Judith Haendeler","Guoyong Yin","Yukihiro Hojo","Yuji Saito","Matthew Melaragno","Chen Yan","Virendra K.
