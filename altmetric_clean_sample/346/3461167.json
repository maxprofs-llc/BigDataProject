Ets binding sites have been described on the promoters or enhancers of many proteinases and several Ets members transcriptionally regulate such promoters in transient cotransfection assays. Ets-1 is involved in both normal and pathological functions. Ets-1 is expressed in a variety of cells, including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and epithelial cells. Ets-1 regulates the expression of several angiogenic and extracellular matrix remodeling factors promoting an invasive phenotype. The Ets family of transcription factors may play a role in the disease progression of breast cancer. In tumors, including breast neoplasia, Ets-1 expression is indicative of poorer prognosis. This review will summarize the role of Ets-1 in both the tumor cells, and the tumor endothelial cells as it relates to breast tumor growth and spread.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074a4","authors":["Lincoln DW 2nd","Bove K"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T16:34:23+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Frontiers in Bioscience","last_mentioned_on":1194130082,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15574387"],"pmid":"15574387","pubdate":"2004-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"The transcription factor Ets-1 in breast cancer.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcription-factor-ets1-breast-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632408,"mean":4.9240837059336,"rank":815995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632408,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95890,"mean":8.2225134686984,"rank":25015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95890,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":475,"mean":2.4555400843882,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":475,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.7777777777778,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
