The enzyme required PQQ for PVA dehydrogenation with phenazine methosulfate, phenazine ethosulfate, and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as electron acceptors and did not show PVA oxidase activity leading to H2O2 formation. The enzyme was active toward low-molecular-weight secondary alcohols rather than primary alcohols. A membrane-bound PVA oxidase was also present in cells of VM15C. Although the purified oxidase showed a substrate specificity similar to that of PQQ-dependent PVA dehydrogenase and about threefold-higher PVA-dehydrogenating activity with phenazine methosulfate or phenazine ethosulfate than PVA oxidase activity with H2O2 formation, it was shown that the enzyme does not contain PQQ as the coenzyme, and PQQ did not affect its activity. Incubation of the membrane fraction of cells with PVA caused a reduction in the cytochrome(s) of the fraction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["M Shimao","K Ninomiya","O Kuno","N Kato","C Sakazawa"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T17:35:04+00:00","issns":["0099-2240"],"issue":"2","journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1357625949,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3513704","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC238858"],"pmcid":"PMC238858","pmid":"3513704","pubdate":"1986-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Existence of a novel enzyme, pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent polyvinyl alcohol dehydrogenase, in a bacterial symbiont, Pseudomonas sp. strain VM15C.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/existence-novel-enzyme-pyrroloquinoline-quinonedependent-polyvinyl-alcohol-dehydrogenase-bacterial-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628563,"mean":4.9406420973419,"rank":817025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628563,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95244,"mean":8.1666661696924,"rank":24722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95244,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3358,"mean":3.6961602621388,"rank":640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3358,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":2.3052325581395,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
