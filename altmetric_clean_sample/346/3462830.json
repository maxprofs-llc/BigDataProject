Axin has been shown to have distinct binding sites for GSK-3 and beta-catenin and to promote the phosphorylation of beta-catenin and its consequent degradation. This provides an explanation for the ability of Axin to inhibit signaling through beta-catenin. In addition, a more N-terminal region of Axin binds to adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a tumor suppressor protein that also regulates levels of beta-catenin. Here, we report the results of a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the C-terminal third of Axin, a region in which no binding sites for other proteins have previously been identified. We found that Axin can bind to the catalytic subunit of the serine\/threonine protein phosphatase 2A through a domain between amino acids 632 and 836. This interaction was confirmed by in vitro binding studies as well as by co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins expressed in cultured cells. Our results suggest that protein phosphatase 2A might interact with the Axin.APC.GSK-3.beta-catenin complex, where it could modulate the effect of GSK-3 on beta-catenin or other proteins in the complex. We also identified a region of Axin that may allow it to form dimers or multimers. Through two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies, we demonstrated that the C-terminal 100 amino acids of Axin could bind to the same region as other Axin molecules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Wei Hsu","Li Zeng","Frank Costantini"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.274.6.3439","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T17:14:14+00:00","issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1195499086,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.274.6.3439","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9920888"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/274\/6\/3439.full.pdf","pmid":"9920888","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Identification of a domain of Axin that binds to the serine\/threonine protein phosphatase 2A and a self-binding domain.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-domain-axin-binds-serinethreonine-protein-phosphatase-2a-selfbinding-domain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4044031,"mean":5.0612478665178,"rank":932736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2553819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4044031,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129073,"mean":9.1508687864139,"rank":39551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":87715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129073,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29208,"mean":2.5133087273599,"rank":1934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":12102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29208,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":324,"mean":3.6196037151703,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":324,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
