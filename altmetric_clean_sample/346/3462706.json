Among four distinct NFAT family members identified to date, mRNAs of NFAT1, NFATc, and NFATx are expressed in the thymus. Here, we report the distribution of these three NFAT family members in human fetal thymocyte subsets and in peripheral mature T cells. We show that NFATx mRNA was expressed in all T lymphocyte subsets tested and was highest in CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes. Conversely, NFAT1 mRNA was preferentially expressed in the mature CD4+ single positive (SP) populations. NFATc mRNA was present at low levels in all subsets but strongly induced upon treatment with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore. Interestingly, we detected NFAT-DNA binding complexes in DP thymocytes, albeit at lower levels than in CD4 SP cells. Corresponding to the mRNA expression, we observed that NFATx was responsible for the NFAT-DNA binding in DP thymocytes. Moreover, this DNA binding was inhibited by cyclosporin A, indicating that NFATx nuclear translocation was regulated by the calcineurin phosphatase in DP thymocytes. For the CD4 SP populations, NFAT1 and NFATc, and to some extent NFATx, were responsible for the NFAT-DNA binding complexes. These results indicate that NFAT family members are differentially regulated during the development of T cells, and that NFATx may play a distinct role in calcineurin-dependent signaling in DP thymocytes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Y Amasaki","E S Masuda","R Imamura","K Arai","N Arai"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T17:11:27+00:00","issns":["0022-1767"],"issue":"5","journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1197981865,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9498773"],"pmid":"9498773","pubdate":"1998-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Distinct NFAT family proteins are involved in the nuclear NFAT-DNA binding complexes from human thymocyte subsets.","type":"article","volume":"160","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distinct-nfat-family-proteins-involved-nuclear-nfatdna-binding-complexes-human-thymocyte-subsets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991404,"mean":5.0365276857663,"rank":917481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2527544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991404,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126859,"mean":9.1230069449374,"rank":38591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126859,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228,"mean":1.8494258634538,"rank":514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":4381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":2.5097348484848,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
