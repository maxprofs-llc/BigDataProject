They all have four transmembrane-spanning domains with a single major extracellular loop. The CD37 is expressed on B cells and on a subpopulation of T cells. The CD53 is known as a panleukocyte marker. The R2 protein is an activation antigen of T cells. The CD37, CD53, and R2 genes were assigned with the help of human\/rodent somatic cell hybrids and human-specific probes to human chromosomes 19, 1, and 11, respectively. For the regional assignment, various deletion hybrids were used to map CD37 to 19p13-q13.4, CD53 to 1p12-p31, and R2 to 11p12.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a97","authors":["K I Virtaneva","P Angelisov\u00e1","T Baumruker","V Horejs\u00ed","H Nevanlinna","J Schr\u00f6der"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T16:16:07+00:00","issns":["0093-7711"],"issue":"6","journal":"Immunogenetics","last_mentioned_on":1201975759,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8436422"],"pmid":"8436422","pubdate":"1993-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The genes for CD37, CD53, and R2, all members of a novel gene family, are located on different chromosomes.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genes-cd37-cd53-r2-members-novel-gene-family-located-different-chromosomes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991404,"mean":5.0365276857663,"rank":917488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991404,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126924,"mean":9.1323195556258,"rank":38527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126924,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":547,"mean":2.2928058608059,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":547,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.4166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"CD53","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=186042901#altmetric_citation_13","license":"public","citation_ids":[3460235,3460238],"posted_on":"2008-01-22T04:12:39+00:00","summary":"Leukocyte surface antigen CD53 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CD53 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=12303542","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Andrew Su","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Andrew Su"}},{"title":"CD37","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=188634482#altmetric_citation_7","license":"public","citation_ids":[3460235,3460238],"posted_on":"2008-02-02T18:09:19+00:00","summary":"Leukocyte antigen CD37 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CD37 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=12303540","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
