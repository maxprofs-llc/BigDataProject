In mice these inputs are detected mainly by the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE). We investigated the role of VNO-mediated inputs in experience-dependent plasticity of reproductive responses. We applied a sex-specific conditioned olfactory aversion (COA) paradigm on adult, wild-type (WT) male mice and on male mice impaired in VNO-mediated signal transduction (TrpC2(-\/-) ). We found that WT males, which underwent COA to female soiled-bedding, lost their innate preference to female odors and presented lower motivation to approach a sexually receptive female. COA also abolished the testosterone surge normally seen following exposure to female pheromones. Moreover, the conditioned males displayed impairments in copulatory behaviors, which lasted for several weeks. Surprisingly, these males also exhibited phobic behaviors towards receptive females, including freezing and fleeing responses. In contrast, WT males which underwent COA specifically to male pheromones showed no change in olfactory preference and only a marginally significant elevation in male-male aggression. Finally, we show that TrpC2(-\/-) males were able to acquire aversion to female soiled-bedding and presented similar behavioral alterations following COA in their responses to female cues. Our results demonstrate that the intrinsic rewarding value of female pheromones can be overridden through associative olfactory learning, which occurs independently of VNO inputs, probably through MOE signaling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293f","authors":["Beny, Yamit","Kimchi, Tali","Beny, Y.","Kimchi, T."],"doi":"10.1111\/gbb.12320","endpage":"732","first_seen_on":"2016-08-18T13:54:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1601-183X","16011848"],"issue":"8","journal":"Genes, Brain & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1485653684,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/gbb.12320","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/gbb.12320&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gbb.12320\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gbb.12320\/full?hootPostID=620307379ecf6895d758a0344d6b99d6","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gbb.12320\/full?hootPostID=157fb6a9b3dcc9c8b1812379013ff8e6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gbb.12320\/pdf","pmid":"27535696","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"722","subjects":["brain","behavioralsciences","genetics"],"title":"\n              Conditioned odor aversion induces social anxiety towards females in wild-type and\n              TrpC2\n              knockout male mice\n            ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/gbb.12320","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conditioned-odor-aversion-induces-social-anxiety-towards-females-wildtype-trpc2-knockout-male-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.8,"score_history":{"1y":5.8,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148366,"mean":6.8920487793494,"rank":1420289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6724394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148366,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252143,"mean":12.220277708592,"rank":59917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":192015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252143,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":660,"mean":4.8410591805766,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":660,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":8.6578125,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
