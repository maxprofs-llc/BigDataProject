O-mannosylation profile of E-cadherin is a newly-described post-translational modification crucial for its adhesive functions in homeostasis. However, the role of O-mannosyl glycans in E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion in cancer and their interplay with N-glycans remains largely unknown. We herein demonstrated that human gastric carcinomas exhibiting a non-functional E-cadherin display a reduced expression of O-mannosyl glycans concomitantly with increased modification with branched complex N-glycans. Accordingly, overexpression of MGAT5-mediated branched N-glycans both in gastric cancer cells and transgenic mice models led to a significant decrease of O-mannosyl glycans attached to E-cadherin that was associated with impairment of its tumour suppressive functions. Importantly, overexpression of protein O-mannosyltransferase 2 (POMT2) induced a reduced expression of branched N-glycans which led to a protective effect of E-cadherin biological functions. Overall, our results reveal a newly identified mechanism of (dys)regulation of E-cadherin that occur through the interplay between O-mannosylation and N-glycosylation pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Carvalho, Sandra","Oliveira, Tiago","Bartels, Markus F","Miyoshi, Eiji","Pierce, Michael","Taniguchi, Naoyuki","Carneiro, F\u00e1tima","Seruca, Raquel","Reis, Celso A","Strahl, Sabine","Pinho, Salom\u00e9 S"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.11245","first_seen_on":"2016-08-18T13:14:24+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1472038502,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27533452?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27533452","pubdate":"2014-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"<i>O<\/i>&#x2013;mannosylation and <i>N<\/i>-glycosylation: two coordinated mechanisms regulating the tumour suppressor functions of E-cadherin in cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/omannosylation-nglycosylation-two-coordinated-mechanisms-regulating-tumour-suppressor-functions-ecad"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":5981102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1996069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254066,"mean":12.210885104205,"rank":165453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":73395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254066,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8803,"mean":3.1459686434901,"rank":3765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8803,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":5.6563492063492,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
