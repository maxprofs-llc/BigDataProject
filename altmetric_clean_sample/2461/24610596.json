CaV 3.2 T-type calcium channels are expressed in both VSMCs and ECs of small arteries. The T-type channels are important drug targets but due to the lack of specific antagonists our understanding of the role of CaV 3.2 channels in vasomotor tone at various ages is scarce. We evaluated the myogenic response, flow-mediated vasodilatation, structural remodeling, and mRNA + protein expression in small mesenteric arteries from CaV 3.2 knock-out vs. wild-type mice at young vs. mature adult age. In young mice, only, deletion of CaV 3.2 led to enhanced myogenic response and \u223c50 % reduction of flow-mediated vasodilatation. Ni(2+) had both CaV 3.2-dependent and -independent effects. No changes in mRNA expression of several important K(+) and Ca(2+) channel genes were induced by CaV 3.2 knock-out. However, the expression of the other T-type channel isoform (CaV 3.1) was reduced at the mRNA and protein level in mature adult compared to young WT arteries. Our study shows important roles of the CaV 3.2 T-type calcium channels in myogenic tone and flow-mediated vasodilation that disappear with aging. Since increased arterial tone is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease we conclude that CaV 3.2 channels, by modulating pressure- and flow-mediated vasomotor responses to prevent excess arterial tone, protect against cardiovascular disease.
