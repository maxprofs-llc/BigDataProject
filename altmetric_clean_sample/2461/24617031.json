Although the biosynthetic pathways of some plant and microbial GLA have been deciphered, current understanding of the correlation between desaturases and GLA synthesis in oleaginous fungi is incomplete. In previous work, we found that a large amount of oleic acid (OA) had not been converted to linoleic acid (LA) or GLA in Mucor circinelloides CBS 277.49, which may be due to inadequate activities of the delta-12 or delta-6 desaturases, and thus leading to the accumulation of OA and LA. Thus, it is necessary to explore the main contributing factor during the process of GLA biosynthesis in M. circinelloides.\nTo enhance GLA production in M. circinelloides, homologous overexpression of delta-12 and two delta-6 desaturases (named delta-6-1 and delta-6-2, respectively) were analyzed. When delta-6 desaturase were overexpressed in M. circinelloides, up to 43% GLA was produced in the total fatty acids, and the yield of GLA reached 180\u00a0mg\/l, which were, respectively, 38 and 33% higher than the control strain.\nThese findings revealed that delta-6 desaturase (especially for delta-6-1 desaturase) plays an important role in GLA synthesis by M. circinelloides. The strain overexpressing delta-6-1 desaturase may have potential application in microbial GLA production.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086e","authors":["Yao Zhang","Xiao Luan","Huaiyuan Zhang","Victoriano Garre","Yuanda Song","Colin Ratledge","Yao Zhang","Xiao Luan","Huaiyuan Zhang","Victoriano Garre","Yuanda Song","Colin Ratledge"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12934-017-0723-8","first_seen_on":"2017-09-01T14:17:52+00:00","issns":["1475-2859"],"issue":"1","journal":"Microbial Cell Factories","last_mentioned_on":1504275455,"links":["https:\/\/microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12934-017-0723-8"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12934-017-0723-8?site=microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28637506","pubdate":"2017-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Enzymology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetic Engineering","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"113","subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Improved \u03b3-linolenic acid production in Mucor circinelloides by homologous overexpressing of delta-12 and delta-6 desaturases","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improved-%CE%B3linolenic-acid-production-mucor-circinelloides-homologous-overexpressing-delta12-delta6-de"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":6416996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173772,"mean":12.406081382969,"rank":122939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173772,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":591,"mean":2.732813559322,"rank":361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":591,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.4475,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
