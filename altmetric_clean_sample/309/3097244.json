The metabolic effects of GH predominantly involve the stimulation of lipolysis in the adipose tissue resulting in an increased flux of free fatty acids (FFAs) into the circulation. In the muscle and liver, GH stimulates triglyceride (TG) uptake, by enhancing lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression, and its subsequent storage. The effects of GH on carbohydrate metabolism are more complicated and may be mediated indirectly via the antagonism of insulin action. Furthermore, GH has a net anabolic effect on protein metabolism although the molecular mechanisms of its actions are not completely understood. The major questions that still remain to be answered are (i) What are the molecular mechanisms by which GH regulates substrate metabolism? (ii) Does GH affect substrate metabolism directly or indirectly via IGF-1 or antagonism of insulin action?","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f6100075bb","authors":["Vijayakumar A","Novosyadlyy R","Wu Y","Yakar S","LeRoith D"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ghir.2009.09.002","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2015-01-23T12:57:37+00:00","issns":["1096-6374","10966374"],"issue":"1","journal":"Growth Hormone & IGF Research","last_mentioned_on":1439387581,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19800274","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ghir.2009.09.002"],"pmid":"19800274","pubdate":"2010-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Biological effects of growth hormone on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biological-effects-growth-hormone-carbohydrate-lipid-metabolism-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5476686,"mean":6.3617939567448,"rank":1183587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4259132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5476686,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189898,"mean":8.5787886907113,"rank":48052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":141263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189898,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":2.494612244898,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.87,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
