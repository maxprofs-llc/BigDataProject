Anti-inflammatories and antioxidant drugs has demonstrated significant renoprotection in experimental nephropathies. Moreover, the inclusion of natural antioxidants derived from food and herbal extracts (such as polyphenols, curcumin and lycopene) as an adjuvant therapy for slowing CKD progression has been largely tested. Brazilian propolis is a honeybee product, whose anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant effects have been widely shown in models of sepsis, cancer, skin irritation and liver fibrosis. Furthermore, previous studies demonstrated that this compound promotes vasodilation and reduces hypertension. However, potential renoprotective effects of propolis in CKD have never been investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a subtype of Brazilian propolis, the Red Propolis (RP), in the 5\/6 renal ablation model (Nx). Adult male Wistar rats underwent Nx and were divided into untreated (Nx) and RP-treated (Nx+RP) groups, after 30 days of surgery; when rats already exhibited marked hypertension and proteinuria. Animals were observed for 90 days from the surgery day, when Nx+RP group showed significant reduction of hypertension, proteinuria, serum creatinine retention, glomerulosclerosis, renal macrophage infiltration and oxidative stress, compared to age-matched untreated Nx rats, which worsened progressively over time. In conclusion, RP treatment attenuated hypertension and structural renal damage in Nx model. Reduction of renal inflammation and oxidative stress could be a plausible mechanism to explain this renoprotection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Fl\u00e1vio Teles","Tarcilo Machado da Silva","Francisco Pessoa da Cruz J\u00fanior","Vitor Hugo Honorato","Henrique de Oliveira Costa","Ana Paula Fernandes Barbosa","Sabrina Gomes de Oliveira","Zenaldo Porf\u00edrio","Alexandre Braga Lib\u00f3rio","Raquel Lerner Borges","Camilla Fanelli"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0116535","first_seen_on":"2015-01-22T19:22:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1451994514,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0116535","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25607548?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25607548","pubdate":"2015-01-21T08:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0116535","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Brazilian red propolis attenuates hypertension and renal damage in 5\/6 renal ablation model.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brazilian-red-propolis-attenuates-hypertension-renal-damage-56-renal-ablation-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":5151679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":988338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230074,"mean":7.8222512767688,"rank":152154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":47340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230074,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102136,"mean":9.9638102903022,"rank":74703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":16258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102136,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2099,"mean":13.702052430887,"rank":1529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2099,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
