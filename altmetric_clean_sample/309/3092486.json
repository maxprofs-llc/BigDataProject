On examination, her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in her right eye was 3\/10 and her BCVA in her left eye was 2\/10. Fundus and optical coherence tomography examination revealed severe bilateral macular edema. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer 6 years ago and was receiving tamoxifen at a dosage of 20 mg\/day ever since. Tamoxifen therapy was discontinued, and the patient received 250 mg of acetazolamide three times a day for a period of 1 month. Both foveae regained their normal contour within 2 months, and her vision was restored to 10\/10 BCVA 3 months later. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported where bilateral intraretinal macular edema is the only retinal manifestation in a patient on oral tamoxifen.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dfa","authors":["Paraskevas Zafeiropoulos","Panagiotis Nanos","Evangelos Tsigkoulis","Maria Stefaniotou"],"doi":"10.1159\/000370144","first_seen_on":"2015-01-22T13:08:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1663-2699"],"issue":"3","journal":"Case Reports in Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1421932069,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25606038?dopt=Abstract#pubmed"],"pmid":"25606038","title":"Bilateral macular edema in a patient treated with tamoxifen: a case report and review of the literature.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bilateral-macular-edema-patient-treated-tamoxifen-case-report-review-literature-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4768206,"mean":5.5000451050449,"rank":3884607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4768206,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159438,"mean":8.6553270194498,"rank":127128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159438,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190,"mean":0.97190476190476,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.96318181818182,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OCTMD\/status\/558249678375239681","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3092486],"posted_on":"2015-01-22T13:07:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Brandon Lujan, MD","url":"http:\/\/OCTMD.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459117248297189376\/n_gr2d1r_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical Retina and Imaging Specialist with Expertise in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).","id_on_source":"OCTMD","tweeter_id":"244660420","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":1320},"tweet_id":"558249678375239681"}]}}
