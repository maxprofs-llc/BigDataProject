Allergic reactions to EO are rare and have been observed mainly in patients during hemodialysis and myelomeningocele patients. We describe severe anaphylaxis to EO in a patient with myelomeningocele during general anesthesia. A detailed description is provided about the prevention measures aimed at reducing exposure to EO including a novel approach by resterilization with plasma. Also, pretreatment with omalizumab was implemented for the first time in such a case. With these measures, further surgeries in our patient were uneventful.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb62a83ee005f8b4577","authors":["Adrian Listyo","Kathrin Scherer Hofmeier","Oliver Bandschapp","Thomas Erb","Carol-Claudius Hasler","Andreas J Bircher"],"doi":"10.1097\/acc.0b013e3182a08ff1","first_seen_on":"2015-01-23T23:39:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2325-7237"],"issue":"1","journal":"A&A Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1422031140,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25612258"],"pmid":"25612258","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Severe Anaphylactic Shock Due to Ethylene Oxide in a Patient with Myelomeningocele: Successful Exposure Prevention and Pretreatment with Omalizumab.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/severe-anaphylactic-shock-due-ethylene-oxide-patient-myelomeningocele"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8214888,"mean":6.9557961245171,"rank":7108996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8214888,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240133,"mean":8.1772218279947,"rank":193420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240133,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":328,"mean":1.3422018348624,"rank":233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":328,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.1777777777778,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
