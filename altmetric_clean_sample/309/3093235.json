Using a terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-Q-PCR), we compared communities of bacteria, fungi, and archaea in a marsh microcosm with one of seven macrophytes, Typha latifolia, Phragmites japonica, Miscanthus sacchariflorus, Scirpus lacustris, Juncus effusus, Phragmites australis, or Zizania latifolia, after exposing them to eCO2 and\/or amended N for 110\u00a0days. Overall, our results showed that the elevated CO2 and N may affect the bacterial and archaeal communities, while they may not affect the fungal community in terms of both diversity and abundance. The effects of elevated CO2 and N on microbial community vary depending on the plant types, and each microbial community shows different responses to the elevated CO2 and N. In particular, elevated CO2 might force a shift in the archaeal community irrespective of the plant type, and the effect of elevated CO2 was enhanced when combined with the N effect. This study indicates that elevated CO2 and N addition could lead to changes in the community structures of bacteria and archaea. Our results also suggest that the fungal group is less sensitive to external changes, while the bacterial and archaeal groups are more sensitive to them. Finally, the characteristics of the plant type and relevant physicochemical factors induced by the elevated CO2 and N may be important key factors structuring the microbial community's response to environmental change, which implies the need for a more comprehensive approach to understanding the pattern of the wetland response to climate change.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022dc","authors":["Seung-Hoon Lee","Seon-Young Kim","Weixing Ding","Hojeong Kang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00253-015-6385-8","first_seen_on":"2015-01-22T15:56:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0614","0175-7598"],"journal":"Applied Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1502219793,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25605423?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00253-015-6385-8?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00253-015-6385-8.pdf","pmid":"25605423","pubdate":"2015-01-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Impact of elevated CO2 and N addition on bacteria, fungi, and archaea in a marsh ecosystem with various types of plants.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-elevated-co2-n-addition-bacteria-fungi-archaea-marsh-ecosystem-various-types-plants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":4447143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2322212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241157,"mean":8.1687839987394,"rank":122057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":92565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241157,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2178,"mean":2.1253752870923,"rank":972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2178,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.7343965517241,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
