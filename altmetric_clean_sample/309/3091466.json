V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are specifically and strongly activated by small organic pyrophosphate molecules termed phosphoantigens (phosphoAg). These low molecular weight compounds are metabolites that are produced by either microbes or endogenously, as intermediates of the mammalian mevalonate pathway, and can accumulate intracellularly during cell stress like transformation or infection. Despite the characterization of numerous natural and synthetic phosphoAg, the mechanism(s) underlying the unique and specific antigenic activation process induced by these compounds remains poorly understood. Activation is both TCR- and cell-to-cell contact-dependent, and results of previous studies have also strongly suggested a key contribution of membrane-associated molecules of primate origin expressed on target cells. The recent identification of B7-related butyrophilin (BTN) molecules CD277\/BTN3A, and more precisely their BTN3A1 isoforms, as mandatory molecules in the phosphoAg-induced recognition of target cells by V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells opens important opportunities for research and applications in this field. Here, we review the unusual and complex antigenic reactivity of human V\u03b39V\u03b42\u2009T cells. We highlight the recent advances in our understanding of this process, and propose a model that integrates the type I glycoprotein BTN3A1 and its intracellular B30.2 domain as a physical intermediate implicated in the detection of dysregulated intracellular levels of phosphoAg and the sensing of cell stress by V\u03b39V\u03b42T cells. A better understanding of this mechanism will help optimize novel immunotherapeutical approaches that utilize the unique functional potential of this major \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Harly, Christelle","Peign\u00e9, Cassie-Marie","Scotet, Emmanuel"],"doi":"10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00657","first_seen_on":"2015-01-22T07:24:17+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1664-3224"],"journal":"Frontiers in immunology","last_mentioned_on":1421911417,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00657\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fimmu.2014.00657\/pdf","pmid":"25601861","pubdate":"2014-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Molecules and Mechanisms Implicated in the Peculiar Antigenic Activation Process of Human V\u03b39V\u03b42 T Cells","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecules-mechanisms-implicated-peculiar-antigenic-activation-process-human-v%CE%B39v%CE%B42-t-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4768206,"mean":5.5000451050449,"rank":3884624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4768206,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159437,"mean":8.6552905115534,"rank":127127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159437,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1953,"mean":1.8424098360656,"rank":1366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1953,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158,"mean":2.1773885350318,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
