We aimed to investigate immunophenotype alterations of na\u00efve and memory B cells and B1a cells in peripheral whole blood from Iranian patients with CGD. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on peripheral blood samples from 31 CGD patients and 23 healthy controls (HC) to study na\u00efve (IgD+\/CD27-), memory (CD27+) B and B1a (CD5+) cells. Soluble CD27 (sCD27) and immunoglobulins were also measured by ELISA and the nephelometric method, respectively. We found significantly higher levels of na\u00efve B cells and B1a cells but lower levels of memory B cells in CGD patients compared to HC.. There was no significant difference in soluble CD27 (sCD27) alteration between CGD patients and HC. Our findings suggested a role for NADPH oxidase in process of B cell differentiation and impairing conversion of na\u00efve B cells to memory B cells and altered B1a cells in CGD patients. Increased susceptibility of CGD patients to opportunistic infections and autoimmune disorders could be partly explained by the altered phenotype of B lymphocytes in these patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f03","authors":["Mohsenzadegan M","Fattahi F","Fattahi F","Mirshafiey A","Fazlollahi MR","Naderi Beni F","Movahedi M","Pourpak Z"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-23T13:08:55+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Iranian Journal of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1422018488,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24659119?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24659119","pubdate":"2014-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Altered Pattern of Na\u00efve and Memory B cells and B1 Cells in Patients with Chronic Granulomatous Disease.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/altered-pattern-na%C3%AFve-memory-b-cells-b1-cells-patients-chronic-granulomatous-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4771370,"mean":5.4999909468322,"rank":3886585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4771370,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159939,"mean":8.6667544923659,"rank":127541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159939,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":0.90272,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.1611111111111,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
