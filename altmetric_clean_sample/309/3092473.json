To examine whether the patient-determined OABSS underestimates or overestimates the true status, its results were compared to those of the OABSS derived from a 7-day bladder diary (OABSS-BD). Methods: Records of patients who visited our outpatient clinic with lower urinary tract symptoms were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were asked to complete the OABSS and the 7-day bladder diary (BD). The OABSS-BD was created from the 7-day BD. Questions were compared between the OABSS and the OABSS-BD. Results: A total of 44 men and 31 women were evaluated. For daytime frequency, the mean OABSS score was 1.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.57 and the OABSS-BD score was 0.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52 (P\u2009<\u20090.01). For nighttime frequency, the mean OABSS score was 2.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.84, and the OABSS-BD score was 1.96\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00 (P\u2009=\u20090.04). For urinary urgency, the mean OABSS score was 2.49\u2009\u00b1\u20091.83, and the OABSS-BD score was 2.70\u2009\u00b1\u20091.90 (P\u2009=\u20090.27). For urgency incontinence, the mean OABSS score was 1.67\u2009\u00b1\u20091.92, and the OABSS-BD score was 1.52\u2009\u00b1\u20091.87 (P\u2009=\u20090.28). For the total score, the mean OABSS total score was 7.26\u2009\u00b1\u20093.92, and the OABSS-BD score was 6.98\u2009\u00b1\u20093.26 (P\u2009=\u20090.23). Conclusions: The OABSS is a very simple and useful tool. However, compared to the results from the 7-day FVC, the present patients overestimated daytime and nighttime frequency. Neurourol.
