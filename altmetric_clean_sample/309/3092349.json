Here we use a combination of multi-scale experimentation and computation to show that water is an integral part of the collagen molecule, which changes conformation upon water removal. The consequence is a shortening of the molecule that translates into tensile stresses in the range of several to almost 100\u2009MPa, largely surpassing those of about 0.3\u2009MPa generated by contractile muscles. Although a complete drying of collagen would be relevant for technical applications, such as the fabrication of leather or parchment, stresses comparable to muscle contraction already occur at small osmotic pressures common in biological environments. We suggest, therefore, that water-generated tensile stresses may play a role in living collagen-based materials such as tendon or bone.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Admir Masic","Admir Masic","Luca Bertinetti","Roman Schuetz","Shu-Wei Chang","Till Hartmut Metzger","Markus J.
