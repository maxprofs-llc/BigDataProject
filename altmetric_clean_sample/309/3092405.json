In this work, densely packed silicon nanotextures with feature sizes smaller than 50\u2009nm enhance the broadband antireflection compared with that predicted by their geometry alone. A significant fraction of the nanotexture volume comprises a surface layer whose optical properties differ substantially from those of the bulk, providing the key to improved performance. The nanotexture reflectivity is quantitatively well-modelled after accounting for both its profile and changes in refractive index at the surface. We employ block copolymer self-assembly for precise and tunable nanotexture design in the range of ~10-70\u2009nm across macroscopic solar cell areas. Implementing this efficient antireflection approach in crystalline silicon solar cells significantly betters the performance gain compared with an optimized, planar antireflection coating.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Atikur Rahman","Ahsan Ashraf","Huolin Xin","Xiao Tong","Peter Sutter","Matthew D Eisaman","Charles T Black"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms6963","first_seen_on":"2015-01-22T12:47:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723","2041-1733"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1438001629,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25607887?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/150121\/ncomms6963\/full\/ncomms6963.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25607887","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ncomms6963","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1038\/ncomms6963"],"pmid":"25607887","pubdate":"2015-01-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Sub-50-nm self-assembled nanotextures for enhanced broadband antireflection in silicon solar cells","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sub50nm-selfassembled-nanotextures-enhanced-broadband-antireflection-silicon-solar-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":101,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":101},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5407728,"mean":6.3062360211608,"rank":45864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":5361850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5407728,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186598,"mean":8.5784886788106,"rank":2648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":183950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186598,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8990,"mean":35.729858938703,"rank":798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":8190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8990,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":593,"mean":34.839935810811,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":593,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
