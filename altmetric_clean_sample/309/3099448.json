AMF possesses advantageous properties due to its less-hydrophilic acetoxymethyl group relative to the hydroxymethyl group of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The hydrophobicity and chemical stability of AMF allowed practical isolation and purification to afford a highly pure product of up to 99.9\u2009%. AMF was produced in good to excellent yields under mild conditions from 5-chloromethylfurfural (CMF) and alkylammonium acetates, both of which could be obtained directly from lignocellulosic biomass. Heterogeneous reactions with polymer-supported alkylammonium acetates were also established; this showed the feasibility of a continuous process for this pathway. AMF could be transformed into various promising furanic compounds, such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), 2,5-furandimethanol (FDM), and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furanoic acid (HFA), in high yields.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Kang, Eun\u2010Sil","Hong, Yeon\u2010Woo","Chae, Da Won","Kim, Bora","Kim, Baekjin","Kim, Yong Jin","Cho, Jin Ku","Kim, Young Gyu","Kang ES","Hong YW","Chae DW","Kim B","Kim YJ","Cho JK","Kim YG"],"doi":"10.1002\/cssc.201403252","endpage":"1188","first_seen_on":"2015-01-24T05:25:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1864-564X","1864-5631"],"issue":"7","journal":"ChemSusChem","last_mentioned_on":1451283929,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201403252\/abstract;jsessionid=9DA51A35890DCACB9F0C1E7799652829.f03t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201403252\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201403252\/abstract;jsessionid=E4E6AF665BE31B746EB02A8C505331AF.f04t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201403252\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cssc.201403252"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201403252\/pdf","pmid":"25619448","pubdate":"2015-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Materials Science","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1179","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"From Lignocellulosic Biomass to Furans via 5\u2010Acetoxymethylfurfural as an Alternative to 5\u2010Hydroxymethylfurfural","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lignocellulosic-biomass-furans-via-5acetoxymethylfurfural-alternative-5hydroxymethylfurfural"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6886791,"mean":6.1810264663194,"rank":1104126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5779124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6886791,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230518,"mean":7.8412772680542,"rank":44273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":186048,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230518,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1457,"mean":2.6779464285714,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":1302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1457,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":4.7333454545455,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
