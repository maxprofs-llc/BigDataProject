Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) is a leading cause of food poisoning worldwide. Here, we show that NLRP12-deficient mice were highly resistant to S. typhimurium infection. Salmonella-infected macrophages induced NLRP12-dependent inhibition of NF-\u03baB and ERK activation by suppressing phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and ERK. NLRP12-mediated down-regulation of proinflammatory and antimicrobial molecules prevented efficient clearance of bacterial burden, highlighting a role for NLRP12 as a negative regulator of innate immune signaling during salmonellosis. These results underscore a signaling pathway defined by NLRP12-mediated dampening of host immune defenses that could be exploited by S. typhimurium to persist and survive in the host.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Md.
