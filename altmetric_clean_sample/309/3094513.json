{"altmetric_id":3094513,"citation":{"abstract":"The sector focus for this issue concerns school based management, current conditions and recommendations for the future. Lao People's Democratic Republic 's (PDR's) education system faces challenges in meeting its goals of providing all students with access to education and improving learning outcomes. The study presents a framework explaining how school based management can help improve education quality. The Lao economy is estimated to grow at 8.1 percent in 2013, fueled by a vibrant resource sector, continued Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)-financed investment in hydropower, and accommodative macro economic policies. Growth is projected to moderate to 7.2 percent in 2014, reflecting a small projected slowdown in some real sectors, mainly mining and construction. Inflationary pressures, mainly through food prices, are not showing signs of dissipating by end 2013. In FY12-13, the fiscal deficit widened markedly due to a combination of a large increase in public sector wages and benefits, and a decline in grants and mining revenues. The FY13-14 budget plan indicates a narrower fiscal deficit of about 4.3 percent. The risk of debt distress remains moderate, according to the recent Joint International Monetary Fund (IMF)-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) 2013. While the Bank of Lao PDR maintains nominal exchange rate stability of the Lao kip against major currencies, foreign exchange policy should probably give more consideration to reserve management and competitiveness. Foreign exchange reserves and net foreign assets continued to fall in the third quarter of 2013.","altmetric_jid":"repec","authors":["World Bank","Santibanez,  Lucrecia","Nghardsaysone,  Konesawang","D'Hoore,  Alain W.","Vongviengkham,  Saysanith","Anantavrasilpa,  Ratchada","Verghis,  Mathew","Record,  Richard","Phimmahasay,  Keomanivone","Davading,  Somneuk","April,  Leah","Regel,  Omporn"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-22T22:37:59+00:00","handle":"10986\/17363","handles":["10986\/17363"],"isbns":[],"issns":[],"journal":"Research Papers in Economics (RePEc)","last_mentioned_on":1420070400,"links":["https:\/\/openknowledge.worldbank.org\/bitstream\/handle\/10986\/17363\/848070WP0LEM0J00Box382144B00PUBLIC0.pdf?sequence=1","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10986\/17363","http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2014\/01\/19127189\/managing-risks-macroeconomic-stability"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/openknowledge.worldbank.org\/bitstream\/10986\/17363\/1\/848070WP0LEM0J00Box382144B00PUBLIC0.pdf","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Vientiane","repec":"RePEc:wbk:wboper:17363","startpage":"1","title":"Lao PDR Economic Monitor, January 2014 : Managing Risks for Macroeconomic Stability","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/19127189"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8079148,"mean":6.8934123253286,"rank":1745302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6277126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8079148,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238786,"mean":8.1274832171201,"rank":57652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":180168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238786,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11203,"mean":4.9017746830923,"rank":3831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":7348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11203,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":6.992407079646,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"counts":{"policy":{"unique_users_count":1,"unique_users":["who"],"posts_count":1},"total":{"posts_count":3},"twitter":{"unique_users_count":2,"unique_users":["RePEc_NEP_SEA","RePEc_NEP_MAC"],"posts_count":2}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RePEc_NEP_SEA\/status\/510483801785368576","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3094513],"posted_on":"2014-09-12T17:43:17+00:00","author":{"name":"NEP-SEA","url":"http:\/\/nep.repec.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502856481373290496\/dEB2Qkhq_normal.png","description":"The latest working papers from RePEc.
