A systematic analysis of the dark matter of the human proteome for druggability and biomarker discovery is crucial to mining the genome. Numerous data mining tools are available to mine these ORFs to develop a comprehensive knowledge base for future target discovery and validation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dcf","authors":["Delgado AP","Brandao P","Chapado MJ","Hamid S","Narayanan R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-23T03:04:11+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"Cancer Genomics & Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1421982157,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25048349?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25048349","pubdate":"2014-07-23T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","geneticsmedical","biochemistry"],"title":"Open Reading Frames Associated with Cancer in the Dark Matter of the Human Genome.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/open-reading-frames-associated-cancer-dark-matter-human-genome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4771370,"mean":5.4999909468322,"rank":3286849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":884782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4771370,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159939,"mean":8.6667407370357,"rank":110210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":32395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159939,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":1.0717454545455,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/eQTL_papers\/status\/558459760308011008","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3095574],"posted_on":"2015-01-23T03:02:37+00:00","author":{"name":"eQTLpapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"TwitterBot for eQTL papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
