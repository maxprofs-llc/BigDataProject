The molecular receptors of noxious mechanical, temperature, or chemical stimuli are expressed in these neurons and have drawn considerable attention as possible targets for analgesic development to improve treatment for the millions who suffer from chronic pain conditions. A number of thermoTRPs, a subset of the transient receptor potential family of ion channels, are activated by a wide range on noxious stimuli. In this review, we review the function of these channels and examine the evidence that thermoTRPs play a vital role in acute, inflammatory and neuropathic nociception.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ae","authors":["Robyn J Laing","Ajay Dhaka"],"doi":"10.1177\/1073858414567884","endpage":"187","first_seen_on":"2015-01-23T19:16:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1089-4098","1073-8584"],"issue":"2","journal":"Neuroscientist","last_mentioned_on":1461892207,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25608689?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/nro.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/2\/171?etoc","http:\/\/nro.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/2\/171.abstract?utm_source=SAGE_social"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nro.sagepub.com\/content\/22\/2\/171.full.pdf","pmid":"25608689","pubdate":"2015-01-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"171","subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"ThermoTRPs and Pain.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thermotrps-pain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7625034,"mean":6.5623772256419,"rank":1712470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5878759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7625034,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235594,"mean":7.9668630477138,"rank":60323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":174203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235594,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":375,"mean":5.6398877005348,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":375,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":5.9490909090909,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
