The present paper reports the case of negation in which imagery could slow down processing. Negation reverses the truth value of a proposition from false to true or vice versa. Consequently, negation works only on propositions (reversing their truth value) and cannot apply directly to other forms of knowledge representation such as images (although they can be veridical or not). This leads to a paradoxical hypothesis: despite the advantage of visualizable words for general processing, the negation of clauses containing words related to the representation of an image would be more difficult than negation containing non-visualizable words. Two experiments support this hypothesis by showing that sentences with a previously negated visualizable word took longer to be read than sentences with previously negated non-visualizable words. The results suggest that a verbal code is used to process negation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002165","doi":"10.1016\/j.actpsy.2014.09.013","first_seen_on":"2015-01-24T01:48:07+00:00","issns":["00016918"],"journal":"Acta Psychologica","last_mentioned_on":1422064068,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0001691814002194"],"pmid":"25463550","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Visual content of words delays negation ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visual-content-words-delays-negation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4773711,"mean":5.4974658684639,"rank":3888116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":126096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4773711,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160402,"mean":8.6513426973649,"rank":127921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160402,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":456,"mean":5.634356043956,"rank":411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":456,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":13.55,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
