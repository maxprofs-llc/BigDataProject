The choice of a more sedentary lifestyle can lead to physical de-conditioning, thereby aggravating asthma symptoms and increasing the risk of obesity.\nThis study aimed at performing a battery of function-related assessments in patients with asthma and comparing them to a healthy control group. A prospective, transversal and case-control study was designed. It was set up at Santa Casa de Miseric\u00f3rdia Hospital -Sao Paulo and Nove de Julho University on a population of outpatients. Subjects of the study were patients affected by moderate to severe asthma. A case-control study was carried out involving 20 patients with moderate to severe asthma and 15 healthy individuals (control group). All participants underwent body composition analysis (BMI and BIA) and a controlled walk test (Shuttle test), resistance muscle test (1RM) and answered a physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ). The group with asthma also answered a questionnaire addressing the clinical control of the illness (ACQ).\nIn comparison to the control group (unpaired Student's t-test), the patients with asthma had a significantly higher BMI (31.09\u2009\u00b1\u20095.98 vs. 26.68\u2009\u00b1\u20097.56 kg\/m(2)) and percentage of body fat (38.40\u2009\u00b1\u20096.75 vs. 33.28\u2009\u00b1\u20098.23%) as well as significantly lower values regarding distance traveled on the walk test (369\u2009\u00b1\u2009110 vs. 494\u2009\u00b1\u200985 meters) and metabolic equivalents (3.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.87 vs. 4.72\u2009\u00b1\u20090.60). A strong correlation was found between the distance completed and peripheral muscle strength (r: 0.57, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and METs (Metabolic equivalents - minutes\/week) and peripheral muscle strength of 1RM (r: 0.61, p\u2009=\u20090.009).\nThe individuals with asthma had lower functional capacity and levels of physical activity as well as a higher percentage of body fat compared to healthy individuals. This suggests that such patients have a reduced physical performance stemming from a sedentary lifestyle. Despite the existence of few studies reporting moderate to severe asthmatic patients and functional capacity assessment, it is clear that the assessment presented in the current study is a valid and accessible tool in clinical practice.","altmetric_jid":"508ef9853cf0583035000000","authors":["Ramos, Elisangela","de Oliveira, Luis Vicente Franco","Silva, Audrey Borghi","Costa, Ivan Peres","Corr\u00eaa, Jo\u00e3o Carlos Ferrari","Costa, Dirceu","Alves, Vera Lucia","Donner, Claudio F","Stirbulov, Roberto","Arena, Ross","Sampaio, Luciana Malosa"],"doi":"10.1186\/2049-6958-10-3","first_seen_on":"2015-01-22T12:17:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2049-6958","1828-695X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Multidisciplinary Respiratory Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1431702255,"links":["http:\/\/www.mrmjournal.com\/content\/10\/1\/3\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25973197?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/2049-6958-10-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mrmjournal.com\/content\/pdf\/2049-6958-10-3.pdf","pmid":"25973197","pubdate":"2015-01-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","startpage":"3","title":"Peripheral muscle strength and functional capacity in patients with moderate to severe asthma.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peripheral-muscle-strength-functional-capacity-patients-moderate-severe-asthma-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5099351,"mean":6.0430677784442,"rank":519409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4576307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5099351,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180408,"mean":8.5072048423843,"rank":24427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":155725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180408,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":3.7760784313725,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":13.157090909091,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
