Among these, osteocytes have recently emerged as an important regulator of bone homeostasis, although their mechanism of regulation is unclear. Here, intravital bone imaging by two-photon excitation microscopy allowed us to directly visualize 'osteocytic osteolysis', or resorption of bone in the lacuno-canalicular system. Osteocyte lacunae and the canalicular network in the cortex of murine tibiae were imaged by in vivo calcein staining, and local acidification in these structures was monitored using a topically applied pH sensor. We also demonstrated that sciatic neurectomy causes significant acidification around osteocytic lacunae and enlargement of lacuno-canalicular areas. These results provide strong evidence for osteocytic osteolysis, and demonstrate that two-photon intravital microscopy is useful for analysis of this phenomenon.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002413","authors":["Sano H","Kikuta J","Furuya M","Kondo N","Endo N","Ishii M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bone.2015.01.013","first_seen_on":"2015-01-24T02:10:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["8756-3282"],"journal":"BONE","last_mentioned_on":1429315246,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebonejournal.com%2Farticle%2FS8756-3282%252815%252900025-3%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=bon-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S8756328215000253"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thebonejournal.com\/article\/S8756328215000253\/pdf","pmid":"25624000","pubdate":"2015-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","orthopedics"],"title":"Intravital bone imaging by two-photon excitation microscopy to identify osteocytic osteolysis in vivo","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intravital-bone-imaging-twophoton-excitation-microscopy-identify-osteocytic-osteolysis-vivo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5005300,"mean":5.928903969976,"rank":3540555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":820590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5005300,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177126,"mean":8.5453992604095,"rank":121671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":35389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177126,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1298,"mean":2.2216114109483,"rank":740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1298,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":8.0318181818182,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
