On pages 148-154 Heyn et al. discuss how gene architectural features - such as the number and length of exons and introns - can influence gene expression. The back cover shows an iconic drawing of early embryonic development of Drosophila by Victoria Foe rendered as an image mosaic. The mosaic was generated by CoverMaker, a Fiji plugin, drawing from a large database of images of gene expression patterns in Drosophila embryos. The mosaic was combined with schematic representation of steps in mRNA splicing reaction to highlight the role of splicing in progression of early embryonic development of fruit flies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cb","doi":"10.1002\/bies.201470025","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2015-01-23T09:12:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-1878","0265-9247"],"issue":"2","journal":"BioEssays","last_mentioned_on":1422100216,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.201470025\/abstract;jsessionid=6EB54F5268A6A40A94719DA221A43D5E.f02t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/bies.201470025&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25616040?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.201470025\/pdf","pmid":"25616040","pubdate":"2015-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","biology"],"title":"Back Cover: BioEssays 2\u22152015.","type":"article","volume":"37"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7918051,"mean":6.6979415254961,"rank":6003070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1063633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7918051,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237240,"mean":8.029112666973,"rank":158634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":46254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237240,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1390,"mean":6.1470323974082,"rank":1167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1390,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":4.00845,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Back Cover: BioEssays 2\u22152015 - 2015 - BioEssays - Wiley Online Library","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/759435357433091\/posts\/844024408974185","license":"public","citation_ids":[3096513],"posted_on":"2015-01-23T09:12:50+00:00","summary":"onlinelibrary.wiley.com","author":{"name":"\u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\u03a3\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/759435357433091","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/759435357433091\/picture","id_on_source":"759435357433091"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fly_papers\/status\/558954935916580864","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3096513],"posted_on":"2015-01-24T11:50:16+00:00","author":{"name":"flypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3298285242\/dc1d0402d707fe3606f9d653cd85fe6d_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Drosophila papers in #PubMed\/#arXiv\/#bioRxiv\/#PeerJ\/#F1000.
