A systematic review of the literature was conducted to: a) estimate the prevalence of second victims among healthcare workers, b) describe personal and work outcomes of second victims, c) identify coping strategies used by second victims to face their problems, and d) describe current support strategies. Findings reveal that the prevalence of \"second victims\" of medical errors is high, ranging in four studies from 10.4% to 43.3%. Medical errors have a negative impact on healthcare providers involved, leading to physical, cognitive and behavioural symptoms including the practice of defensive medicine. Managers of health organizations need to be aware of the \"second victim\" phenomenon and ensure adequate support is given to healthcare providers involved. The best strategy seems to be the creation of networks of support at both the individual and organizational levels. More research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of support structures for second victims and to quantify the extent of the practice of defensive medicine following medical error.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9213cf058f61000d7fb","authors":["Panella M","Rinaldi C","Vanhaecht K","Donnarumma C","Tozzi Q","Di Stanislao F"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-22T12:57:31+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Igiene e sanit\u00e0 pubblica","last_mentioned_on":1450114251,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24770362"],"pmid":"24770362","pubdate":"2014-04-29T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"[Second victims of medical errors: a systematic review of the literature].","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/second-victims-medical-errors-systematic-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6756570,"mean":6.169004694245,"rank":2329593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4404346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6756570,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229326,"mean":7.8055098920747,"rank":68964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":159469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229326,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.1796875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2,"US":1},"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SallyPezaro\/status\/558246920138002432","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3092440],"posted_on":"2015-01-22T12:56:52+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"SallyPezaro","tweeter_id":"2485507898","geo":{"lt":52.40656,"ln":-1.51217,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"558246920138002432"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/proftombourne\/statuses\/676057449665794048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[3092440],"posted_on":"2015-12-13T15:13:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Professor Tom Bourne","url":"http:\/\/www1.imperial.ac.uk\/medicine\/people\/t.bourne\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/594583608247132161\/Jh00hpzE_normal.jpg","description":"Gynaecologist, Ultrasound, Academic, Strategy - Imperial College, London & KU Leuven, Belgium.
