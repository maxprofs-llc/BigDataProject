Recently, there has been evidence that magnetic fields exert multiple effects on the biological performance of cells and may aid in the treatment of vascular disease. However, the effect of a static magnetic field (SMF) on human VSMCs still remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of low strength SMF on human VSMCs in an in vitro restenosis model. A SMF was established using neodymium-yttrium-iron permanent magnet. Human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (hUASMCs) were isolated and seeded to a fibronectin-coated plate to form an in vitro restenosis model and then exposed to a vertically oriented field of 5\u00a0militesla (mT). MTT, transwell, and adhesion assays were used to demonstrate that the proliferation, migration, and adhesion potential of hUASMCs were significantly decreased after exposure to 5\u00a0mT SMF for 48\u00a0h compared with a non-treated group. Meanwhile, confocal microscopy analysis was used to demonstrate that integrin \u03b2(1) clustering was inhibited by exposure to 5\u00a0mT SMF. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was markedly inhibited, and the upregulated cytosolic free calcium had been reversed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, the biological effects of low strength SMF on hUASMCs could be blocked by the administration of GRGDSP-the blockade of integrins. In conclusion, a low strength SMF can influence the proliferation, migration, and adhesion of VSMCs by inhibiting the clustering of integrin \u03b21, decreasing cytosolic free calcium concentration, and inactivating FAK. With further validation, SMFs may aid in attenuating abnormal VSMCs biological performance and has potential to block atherogenesis and prevent restenosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5693cf058f610004b0e","authors":["Yan Li","Li-Qiang Song","Michael Q.
