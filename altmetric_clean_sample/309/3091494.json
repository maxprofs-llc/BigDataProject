Target naming (n=1482) and non-target naming (other, n=2411) were coded for synchronous spoken words and object motion (multimodal motherese) and other naming styles. Indian mothers abundantly used multimodal motherese with target words to highlight novel word-referent relations, paralleling earlier findings from American mothers. They used it with target words more often for prelexical infants than for advanced lexical children and to name target actions later in children's development. Unlike American mothers, Indian mothers also abundantly used multimodal motherese to name target objects later in children's development. Finally, monolingual mothers who spoke a verb-dominant Indian language used multimodal motherese more often than bilingual mothers who also spoke noun-dominant English to their children. The findings suggest that within a dynamic and reciprocal mother-infant communication system, multimodal motherese adapts to unify novel words and referents across cultures. It adapts to children's level of lexical development and to ambient language-specific lexical dominance hierarchies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002d98","doi":"10.1016\/j.jecp.2014.09.002","first_seen_on":"2015-01-22T07:36:59+00:00","issns":["00220965"],"journal":"Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1421912191,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022096514001726"],"pmid":"25285369","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Cross-cultural evidence for multimodal motherese: Asian Indian mothers\u2019 adaptive use of synchronous words and gestures ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crosscultural-evidence-multimodal-motherese-asian-indian-mothers-adaptive-synchronous-words-gestures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4768206,"mean":5.5000451050449,"rank":3884613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4768206,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159438,"mean":8.6553718647492,"rank":127129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159438,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":505,"mean":5.6085158730159,"rank":434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":505,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.8767272727273,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
