However, predictive biomarkers for optimal therapy of LAPC remain to be identified.We retrospectively estimated amplification of the ACTN4 gene to determine its usefulness as a predictive biomarker for LAPC.Methods:The copy number of ACTN4 in 91 biopsy specimens of LAPC before treatment was evaluated using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH).Results:There were no statistically significant differences in overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) of LAPC between patients treated with chemotherapy alone or with CRT. In a subgroup analysis of patients treated with CRT, patients with a copy number increase (CNI) of ACTN4 had a worse prognosis of OS than those with a normal copy number (NCN) of ACTN4 (P=0.0005, log-rank test). However, OS in the subgroup treated with chemotherapy alone was not significantly different between patients with a CNI and a NCN of ACTN4. In the patients with a NCN of ACTN4, the median survival time of PFS in CRT-treated patients was longer than that of patients treated with chemotherapy alone (P=0.049).Conclusions:The copy number of ACTN4 is a predictive biomarker for CRT of LAPC.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 20 January 2015; doi:10.1038\/bjc.2014.623 www.bjcancer.com.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243d","authors":["T Watanabe","H Ueno","Y Watabe","N Hiraoka","C Morizane","J Itami","T Okusaka","N Miura","T Kakizaki","T Kakuya","M Kamita","A Tsuchida","Y Nagakawa","H Wilber","T Yamada","K Honda"],"doi":"10.1038\/bjc.2014.623","first_seen_on":"2015-01-21T21:44:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0007-0920","1532-1827"],"journal":"British Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1430561405,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/bjc\/rss\/aop\/~3\/DpCpSdU964s\/bjc.2014.623","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25602965?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25602965","pubdate":"2015-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"ACTN4 copy number increase as a predictive biomarker for chemoradiotherapy of locally advanced pancreatic cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/actn4-copy-number-increase-predictive-biomarker-chemoradiotherapy-locally-advanced-pancreatic-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5047427,"mean":5.9756939802598,"rank":482952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4544009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5047427,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179011,"mean":8.4681613205967,"rank":23150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":155260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179011,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2832,"mean":7.4073691275168,"rank":520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":2254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2832,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":16.441208955224,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
