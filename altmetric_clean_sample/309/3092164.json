We report the case of an incidentally discovered liver mass suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma, which on biopsy was suggestive of a pseudocyst but after resection was found to be hepatic PEComa with some of the usual characteristics of this neoplasm as well as several less familiar features. We have also reviewed cases of hepatic PEComa from the literature in order to provide insight into recognising possible PEComa preoperatively and assessing its risk of malignancy after diagnosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Khan HM","Katz SC","Libbey NP","Somasundar PS"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2014-204122","first_seen_on":"2015-01-22T11:46:03+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"","journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1421927104,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24907216?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24907216","pubdate":"2014-06-08T23:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Hepatic PEComa: a potential pitfall in the evaluation of hepatic neoplasms.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatic-pecoma-potential-pitfall-evaluation-hepatic-neoplasms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4768206,"mean":5.5000451050449,"rank":2465881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1672938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4768206,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159438,"mean":8.6553154161206,"rank":82939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":56880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159438,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2218,"mean":3.0693558863329,"rank":840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2218,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.8886206896552,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/status\/558228851474460672","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3092164],"posted_on":"2015-01-22T11:45:04+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"558228851474460672"}]}}
