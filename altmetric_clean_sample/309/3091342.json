Extracellular adenosine is well reported to induce apoptosis of tumor cells. Here we found that extracellular adenosine suppresses the cell growth by induction of apoptosis in BEL-7404 liver cancer cells, and identified a novel mechanism that extracellular adenosine triggers apoptosis by increasing Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane dysfunction in the cells. We observed that adenosine increases ROS production, activates c-Caspase-8 and -9 and Caspase effectors, c-Caspase-3 and c-PARP, induces accumulation of apoptosis regulator Bak, decreases Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, and causes the mitochondrial membrane dysfunction and the release of DIABLO, Cytochrome C, and AIF from mitochondria to cytoplasm in the cells; ROS inhibitor, NAC significantly reduces adenosine-induced ROS production; it also shows the same degree of blocking adenosine-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and apoptosis. Our study first observed that adenosine increases ROS production in tumor cells and identified the positive feedback loop for ROS-mediated mitochondrial membrane dysfunction which amplifies the death signals in the cells. Our findings indicated ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction play a key role in adenosine-induced apoptosis of 7404 cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Ma Y","Zhang J","Zhang Q","Chen P","Song J","Yu S","Liu H","Liu F","Song C","Yang D","Liu J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2014.04.007","first_seen_on":"2015-01-22T06:23:53+00:00","issns":["0006-291X"],"issue":"","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1421907745,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24727456\/"],"pmid":"24727456","pubdate":"2014-04-15T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Adenosine induces apoptosis in human liver cancer cells through ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adenosine-induces-apoptosis-human-liver-cancer-cells-through-ros-production-mitochondrial-dysfunctio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4768206,"mean":5.5000451050449,"rank":2465885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1672929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4768206,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159438,"mean":8.6553718647492,"rank":82939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":56878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159438,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7694,"mean":2.1642433380996,"rank":4725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":2401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7694,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":2.2675183246073,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
