The spatial variations in activities of five hydrolytic enzymes were examined using geostatistical methods. The relationships between soil enzyme activities and other soil properties were evaluated using both an integrated total enzyme activity index (TEI) and the geometric mean of enzyme activities (GME). At the county scale, soil invertase, phosphatase, and catalase activities were moderately spatially correlated, whereas urease and dehydrogenase activities were weakly spatially correlated. Correlation analysis showed that both TEI and GME were better correlated with selected soil physicochemical properties than single enzyme activities. Multivariate regression analysis showed that soil OM content had the strongest positive effect while soil pH had a negative effect on the two enzyme activity indices. In addition, total phosphorous content had a positive effect on TEI and GME in orchard soils, whereas alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen and available potassium contents, respectively, had negative and positive effects on these two enzyme indices in cropland soils. The results indicate that land use changes strongly affect soil enzyme activities in agricultural land, where TEI provides a sensitive biological indicator for soil quality.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088c9","authors":["Xiangping Tan","Baoni Xie","Junxing Wang","Wenxiang He","Xudong Wang","Gehong Wei"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/535768","first_seen_on":"2015-01-24T07:56:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1537-744X"],"journal":"The Scientific World Journal","last_mentioned_on":1422086145,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25610908"],"pmid":"25610908","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"County-scale spatial distribution of soil enzyme activities and enzyme activity indices in agricultural land: implications for soil quality assessment.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/countyscale-spatial-distribution-soil-enzyme-activities-enzyme-activity-indices-agricultural-land-im-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4773711,"mean":5.4974658684639,"rank":3288145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":885609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4773711,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160402,"mean":8.6513925723656,"rank":110556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":32476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160402,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1349,"mean":1.8624480712166,"rank":744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1349,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.7551282051282,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
