For every 3 additional self-recalled concussions, there was a mean decrease of 7.2 points (range of possible scores = 14-98) in concussion attitude score (P = 0.002), a 48% decrease in the self-reported proportion of concussion events disclosed (P = 0.013), and an increased prevalence of self-reported participation in games (67%) and practices (125%) while experiencing signs and symptoms of concussion (P < 0.001). Increased concussion history did not affect concussion knowledge score (P = 0.333).\nNegative trends in concussion disclosure behavior were identified in youth athletes with a positive history of concussion. Improving disclosure in this subgroup will require targeted efforts addressing negative attitude to concussion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002560","authors":["Register-Mihalik, Johna K.","Valovich McLeod, Tamara C.","Linnan, Laura A.","Guskiewicz, Kevin M.","Marshall, Stephen W.","Register-Mihalik, Johna K","Valovich McLeod, Tamara C","Linnan, Laura A","Guskiewicz, Kevin M","Marshall, Stephen W","Johna K.
