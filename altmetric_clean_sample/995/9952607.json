These cues can then be used to segment new words from running speech. We explored whether infants are capable of detecting a novel word form using the frequency of occurrence of the onset alone to further characterize the role of phonotactics in speech segmentation. Experiment 1 shows that English-learning 9-month-olds can successfully segment a word from natural speech if the onset is legal in English (i.e., pleet) but not if the onset is illegal (i.e., tleet). Experiment 2 shows that English-learning 9-month-olds are successful at word segmentation when presented with two onset clusters that vary in statistical frequency. Infants familiarized to a high-frequency onset (i.e., trom) were successful at segmenting the target word embedded in speech, but those familiarized to the low-frequency onset (i.e., drom) were unsuccessful. Together, these results show that infants use statistical information from the speech input and that low levels of exposure to onset phonotactics alone might not be sufficient in identifying word boundaries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002d98","authors":["Archer, Stephanie L","Curtin, Suzanne"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jecp.2016.04.004","endpage":"141","first_seen_on":"2016-07-22T13:02:54+00:00","issns":["1096-0457","00220965"],"journal":"Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1469191902,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022096516300054"],"pmid":"27181298","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"131","subjects":["psychology","pediatrics"],"title":"Nine-month-olds use frequency of onset clusters to segment novel words","type":"article","volume":"148","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ninemontholds-frequency-onset-clusters-segment-novel-words"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091619,"mean":6.8840984628706,"rank":4279516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2246367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091619,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257247,"mean":11.936673456535,"rank":141233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257247,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":802,"mean":7.4454581772784,"rank":562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":802,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":9.0594545454545,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
