It is widely accepted that omnivorous crustaceans have higher \u03b1-amylase activity and number of isoforms than carnivorous, but contradictory results have been obtained in some species, and carnivorous crustaceans have been less studied. In addition, the physiological meaning of \u03b1-amylase polymorphism in crustaceans is not well understood. In this work we studied \u03b1-amylase in a carnivorous lobster at the gene, transcript, and protein levels. It was showed that \u03b1-amylase isoenzyme composition (i.e., phenotype) in lobster determines carbohydrate digestion efficiency. Most frequent \u03b1-amylase phenotype has the lowest digestion efficiency, suggesting this is a favoured trait. We revealed that gene and intron loss have occurred in lobster \u03b1-amylase, thus lobsters express a single 1830 bp cDNA encoding a highly conserved protein with 513 amino acids. This protein gives rise to two isoenzymes in some individuals by glycosylation but not by limited proteolysis. Only the glycosylated isoenzyme could be purified by chromatography, with biochemical features similar to other animal amylases. High carbohydrate content in diet down-regulates \u03b1-amylase gene expression in lobster. However, high \u03b1-amylase activity occurs in lobster gastric juice irrespective of diet and was proposed to function as an early sensor of the carbohydrate content of diet to regulate further gene expression. We concluded that gene\/isoenzyme simplicity, post-translational modifications and low Km, coupled with a tight regulation of gene expression, have arose during evolution of \u03b1-amylase in the carnivorous lobster to control excessive carbohydrate digestion in the presence of an active \u03b1-amylase.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Leandro Rodr\u00edguez-Viera","Erick Perera","Juan Antonio Martos-Sitcha","Rolando Perdomo-Morales","Antonio Casuso","Vivian Montero-Alejo","Tsai Garc\u00eda-Galano","Gonzalo Mart\u00ednez-Rodr\u00edguez","Juan Miguel Mancera","Diego Breviario"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0158919","first_seen_on":"2016-07-22T18:26:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1501226505,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0158919","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27391425?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0158919.PDF","pmcid":"PMC4938498","pmid":"27391425","pubdate":"2016-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0158919","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Molecular, Biochemical, and Dietary Regulation Features of \u03b1-Amylase in a Carnivorous Crustacean, the Spiny Lobster Panulirus argus","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-biochemical-dietary-regulation-features-%CE%B1amylase-carnivorous-crustacean-spiny-lobster-panu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.2,"score_history":{"1y":3.2,"6m":3.2,"3m":3.2,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":695068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7589615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259248,"mean":11.977026341674,"rank":32285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":226896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259248,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114688,"mean":10.59611410186,"rank":14819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":99853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114688,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4353,"mean":10.532514246324,"rank":519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4353,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":5,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Investigadores de la UCA, La Habana y el ICMAN dilucidan el papel de las amilasas en la digesti\u00f3n de la langosta espinosa","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27353060232&p=1pl&v=1&x=niBlgvXJtH7S_ntox9BLpA","license":"public","citation_ids":[9958711,9958711],"posted_on":"2016-07-22T11:12:23+00:00","summary":"Universidad de C\u00e1diz (via noodls) \/ Sus resultados, publicados en un art\u00edculo en la prestigiosa revista 'PLOS-ONE', tendr\u00e1n aplicaciones en el desarrollo de dietas para su cultivo comercial en la acuicultura Investigadores de las universidades de C\u00e1di\u2026","author":{"name":"Noodls","url":"http:\/\/www.noodls.com\/index.asp","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/955\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-02-11_at_11.48.48.png?1455191394"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/thepcrcompany\/statuses\/882963630991581184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9958711],"posted_on":"2017-07-06T14:05:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Bioline","url":"http:\/\/www.bioline.com\/contact-form","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/660046479810281472\/jBhqvfLT_normal.jpg","description":"Bioline: The PCR Company.
