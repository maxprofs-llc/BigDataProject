We recently failed to find any age-independent link between dewlap size and social status in the common eland (Tragelaphus oryx), pointing to the possibility that sexual selection may not be the primary cause of dewlap evolution in ungulates. Here I use a two-pronged approach to test hypotheses on the function of ungulate dewlaps: an interspecific comparative analysis of bovids and deer, and an intraspecific study of eland antelopes in the wild.\nAcross species, the presence of dewlaps in males was not found to be associated with sexual size dimorphism, a commonly used measure of the intensity of sexual selection. The presence of dewlaps was, however, linked to very large male body size (>400\u00a0kg), which agrees with a thermoregulatory function as lower surface\/volume-ratio counteracts heat dissipation in large-bodied species. In eland antelopes, large dewlap size was associated with higher, rather than lower, incidence of claw-marks (independently of age), a result which speaks against the dewlap as a predator deterrent and rather indicates a predation cost of the structure.\nThe findings suggest that, although an additional function in communication should not be ruled out, the dewlap of ungulates may contrast with that of lizards and birds in thermoregulation being a primary function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000081e","authors":["Jakob Bro-J\u00f8rgensen","Bro-J\u00f8rgensen, Jakob"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12983-016-0165-x","first_seen_on":"2016-07-22T19:57:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1742-9994"],"issue":"1","journal":"Frontiers in Zoology","last_mentioned_on":1489758500,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1186%2Fs12983-016-0165-x","http:\/\/frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12983-016-0165-x","https:\/\/frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12983-016-0165-x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1186%2Fs12983-016-0165-x.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4949748","pmid":"27437025","pubdate":"2016-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Applied Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biodiversity","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1","title":"Evolution of the ungulate dewlap: thermoregulation rather than sexual selection or predator deterrence?","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolution-ungulate-dewlap-thermoregulation-rather-sexual-selection-predator-deterrence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":3532666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4786603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259943,"mean":11.991288441267,"rank":99563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":157703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259943,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":382,"mean":18.451853018373,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":382,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":7.812,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
