Three blinded readers independently evaluated signal intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Intraobserver and interobserver agreements were calculated. Fisher exact test and Welch t test were used to compare signal intensity and ADC values, respectively, with pathological results. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine diagnostic accuracy of various thresholds for ADC. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nMean ADC values of the mucin-producing cysts were 3.26 \u00d7 10, 3.27 \u00d7 10, and 3.35 \u00d7 10 mm\/s for the 3 readers, respectively. Mean ADC values of the serous cysts were 2.86 \u00d7 10, 2.85 \u00d7 10, and 2.85 \u00d7 10 mm\/s for the 3 readers, respectively. Differences in ADC values between the 2 cyst groups were 12.4%, 12.9%, and 14.8% for the 3 readers, respectively (P < 0.001). Intraobserver and interobserver agreement was excellent. A threshold ADC of 3 \u00d7 10 mm\/s resulted in correct identification of cysts in 77% to 81% of cases, with sensitivity and specificity ranging between 84% and 88% and 66% and 72%, respectively.\nDiffusion-weighted imaging may be a helpful tool in distinguishing between mucin-producing and serous pancreatic cysts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c0f","authors":["Pozzessere, Chiara","Casta\u00f1os Guti\u00e9rrez, Sandra Luz","Corona-Villalobos, Celia Pamela","Righi, Lorenzo","Xu, Chunmiao","Lennon,
