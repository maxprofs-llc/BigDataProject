The recently described 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome is characterized by characteristic dysmorphic features, intellectual disability and brain morphological abnormalities, but the precise genetic basis for these abnormalities remains unknown. Here, our detailed analysis of the genetic abnormalities of 1q41q42 microdeletion cases identified TP53BP2, which encodes apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 2 (ASPP2), as a candidate gene for brain abnormalities. Consistent with this, Trp53bp2-deficient mice show dilation of lateral ventricles resembling the phenotype of 1q41q42 microdeletion patients. Trp53bp2 deficiency causes 100% neonatal lethality in the C57BL\/6 background associated with a high incidence of neural tube defects and a range of developmental abnormalities such as congenital heart defects, coloboma, microphthalmia, urogenital and craniofacial abnormalities. Interestingly, abnormalities show a high degree of overlap with 1q41q42 microdeletion-associated abnormalities. These findings identify TP53BP2 as a strong candidate causative gene for central nervous system (CNS) defects in 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome, and open new avenues for investigation of the mechanisms underlying CNS abnormalities.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 22 July 2016; doi:10.1038\/cdd.2016.76.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["J Zak","V Vives","D Szumska","A Vernet","J E Schneider","P Miller","E A Slee","S Joss","Y Lacassie","E Chen","L F Escobar","M Tucker","A S Aylsworth","H A Dubbs","A T Collins","J Andrieux","A Dieux-Coeslier","E Haberlandt","D Kotzot","D A Scott","M J Parker","Z Zakaria","Y S Choy","D Wieczorek","A M Innes","K R Jun","S Zinner","F Prin","C A Lygate","P Pretorius","J A Rosenfeld","T J Mohun","X Lu","Zak, J","Vives, V","Szumska, D","Vernet, A","Schneider, J E","Miller, P","Slee, E A","Joss, S","Lacassie, Y","Chen, E","Escobar, L F","Tucker, M","Aylsworth, A S","Dubbs, H A","Collins, A T","Andrieux, J","Dieux-Coeslier, A","Haberlandt, E","Kotzot, D","Scott, D A","Parker, M J","Zakaria, Z","Choy, Y S","Wieczorek, D","Innes, A M","Jun, K R","Zinner, S","Prin, F","Lygate, C A","Pretorius, P","Rosenfeld, J A","Mohun, T J","Lu, X"],"doi":"10.1038\/cdd.2016.76","first_seen_on":"2016-07-22T15:11:28+00:00","funders":["niehs","bhf"],"issns":["1350-9047"," 1476-5403","1476-5403"],"journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1477486048,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cdd\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/cdd201676a.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/cdd\/rss\/aop\/~3\/dSzE3yhSFlM\/cdd.2016.76","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27447114?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27447114?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27447114"],"pmid":"27447114","pubdate":"2016-07-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Disease genetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"CNS cancer","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Development","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"ASPP2 deficiency causes features of 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aspp2-deficiency-causes-features-1q41q42-microdeletion-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.35,"score_history":{"1y":14.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7596091,"mean":6.5461949734624,"rank":507307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7087555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7596091,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252801,"mean":11.76788238924,"rank":26992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":225752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252801,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1045,"mean":5.5350747126437,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1045,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":7.9735483870968,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
