Waves, including spin waves, excel at encoding information via their phase using interference. This enables a number of inputs to be processed in one device, which offers the promise of multi-input multi-output logic gates. To realize such an integrated device, it is essential to demonstrate spin wave interferometers using spatially isotropic spin waves with high operational stability. However, spin wave reflection at the waveguide edge has previously limited the stability of interfering waves, precluding the use of isotropic spin waves, i.e., forward volume waves. Here, a spin wave absorber is demonstrated comprising a yttrium iron garnet waveguide partially covered by gold. This device is shown experimentally to be a robust spin wave interferometer using the forward volume mode, with a large ON\/OFF isolation value of 13.7\u2009dB even in magnetic fields over 30\u2009Oe.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Naoki Kanazawa","Taichi Goto","Koji Sekiguchi","Alexander B.
