Here, three-dimensional (3D) N-doped porous carbon (NPC) materials have been successfully developed by a simple template-assisted (e.g., SiO2 spheres) high temperature pyrolysis approach using shrimp-shell derived N-doped carbon nanodots (N-CNs) as carbon and nitrogen sources obtained through a facile hydrothermal method. The shrimp-shell derived N-CNs with a product yield of \u223c5% possess rich surface O- and N-containing functional groups and small nanodot sizes of 1.5-5.0 nm, which are mixed with surface acidification treated SiO2 spheres with an average diameter of \u223c200 nm in aqueous solution to form a N-CNs@SiO2 composite subjected to a thermal evaporation treatment. The resultant N-CNs@SiO2 composite is further thermally treated in a N2 atmosphere at different pyrolysis temperatures, followed by acid etching, to obtain 3D N-doped porous carbon (NPC) materials. As electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, the experimental results demonstrate that 3D NPC obtained at 800 \u00b0C (NPC-800) with a surface area of 360.2 m(2) g(-1) exhibits the best ORR catalytic activity with an onset potential of -0.06 V, a half wave potential of -0.21 V and a large limiting current density of 5.3 mA cm(-2) (at -0.4 V, vs. Ag\/AgCl) among all NPC materials investigated, comparable to that of the commercial Pt\/C catalyst with an onset potential of -0.03 V, a half wave potential of -0.17 V and a limiting current density of 5.5 mA cm(-2) at -0.4 V. Such a 3D porous carbon ORR electrocatalyst also displays superior durability and high methanol tolerance in alkaline media, apparently better than the commercial Pt\/C catalyst. The findings of this work would be valuable for the development of low-cost and abundant N-doped carbon materials from biomass as high performance metal-free electrocatalysts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Rongrong Liu","Haimin Zhang","Shengwen Liu","Xian Zhang","Tianxing Wu","Xiao Ge","Yipeng Zang","Huijun Zhao","Guozhong Wang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c5cp06970j","endpage":"4101","first_seen_on":"2016-11-22T11:28:51+00:00","issns":["1463-9084"],"issue":"5","journal":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP)","last_mentioned_on":1481256418,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2016\/cp\/c5cp06970j","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2016\/cp\/c5cp06970j#!divAbstract%E6%9D%A5%E6%BA%90:%E4%B8%AD%E7%A7%91%E9%99%A2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/cp\/c5cp06970j","pmid":"26778836","pubdate":"2016-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"4095","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Shrimp-shell derived carbon nanodots as carbon and nitrogen sources to fabricate three-dimensional N-doped porous carbon electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shrimpshell-derived-carbon-nanodots-carbon-nitrogen-sources-fabricate-threedimensional-ndoped-porous"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":11,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7866440,"mean":6.6628832942016,"rank":693018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7164286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7866440,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252264,"mean":12.159983326924,"rank":35453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":216512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252264,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3747,"mean":2.1761713828083,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":3659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3747,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":1.601388101983,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
