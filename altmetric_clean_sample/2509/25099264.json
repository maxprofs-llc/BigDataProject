CXCR4-tropic strains of HIV-1 may affect the function of CD34(+)CXCR4(+) progenitor cells either by infecting the cells or modifying the dynamics of more differentiated hematopoietic cells. However, CD34(+) cells are known for their resistance to HIV-1 infection in vitro, which restricts any detailed analysis of the impact of HIV on HSPCs. We report the use of RetroNectin, a recombinant fibronectin fragment used for gene transfer with lentiviral vectors, to overcome the limitation associated with CD34(+) cell resistance to HIV-1 infection. RetroNectin coating of plates improved in vitro HIV-1 infectivity on human CD34(+) cells by 10 fold. This resulted in stable HIV-1 infection for 5 weeks in an OP9-DL1 coculture. These results suggest that RetroNectin may be a useful tool for long-term monitoring of in vitro HIV-infected CD34(+) cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f91","authors":["Tetsuo Tsukamoto","Seiji Okada"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jviromet.2017.08.003","first_seen_on":"2017-09-11T10:00:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01660934"],"journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","last_mentioned_on":1505124032,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0166093417303567"],"pmid":"28789988","pubdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"The use of RetroNectin in studies requiring in vitro HIV-1 infection of human hematopoietic stem\/progenitor cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retronectin-studies-requiring-vitro-hiv1-infection-human-hematopoietic-stemprogenitor-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8397236,"mean":7.0723276090205,"rank":7258260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8397236,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121932,"mean":11.68979209553,"rank":98918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121932,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":764,"mean":2.0403224115334,"rank":623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":764,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.4794117647059,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/biorxiv_pubd\/statuses\/907182061550792704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25099264],"posted_on":"2017-09-11T10:00:32+00:00","author":{"name":"bioRxiv Published","url":"http:\/\/biorxiv.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/758011263725305857\/QZIhYkXo_normal.jpg","description":"The non-profit preprint server for the life sciences","id_on_source":"biorxiv_pubd","tweeter_id":"757666082052304897","geo":{"lt":43.00035,"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US"},"followers":784},"tweet_id":"907182061550792704"}]}}
