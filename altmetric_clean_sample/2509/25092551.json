Twenty-four chronic stroke patients participated in this study. Participants were randomly allocated to either the landscape imagery observation physical training group (LIOPT) or the action observation physical training group (AOPT). LIOPT observed a landscape picture for 2\u00a0min 30\u00a0s while the AOPT group observed related video recording. Both groups underwent a physical training session after the observation session for 12\u00a0min 30\u00a0s and the sessions were repeated twice a day, 3\u00a0times a week for 6\u00a0weeks. Outcome measures included Time Up and Go Test (TUG), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Weight Distribution Index (WDI), and limit of stability (LOS). Between-group and within-group comparisons were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed rank test, respectively. The AOPT and LIOPT groups have shown statistically significant differences in TUG, DGI, WDI, and LOS over time. However, no significant difference was observed in terms of TUG, DGI and WDI, but only in LOS between groups. These findings suggest that action observation training and physical training are effective to improve sit to walk and balance ability of chronic stroke patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100013e1","authors":["Jin-Cheol Kim","Hyun-Min Lee"],"doi":"10.1080\/00222895.2017.1363697","first_seen_on":"2017-09-11T06:47:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-2895","1940-1027"],"journal":"Journal of Motor Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1505133240,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00222895.2017.1363697"],"pmid":"28873036","publisher":"Routledge","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"The Effect of Action Observation Training on Balance and Sit to Walk in Chronic Stroke: A Crossover Randomized Controlled Trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-action-observation-training-balance-sit-walk-chronic-stroke-crossover-randomized-controlled-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":1.6,"1m":1.6,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8397236,"mean":7.0723276090205,"rank":3953557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4409891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8397236,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121985,"mean":11.685134853751,"rank":53211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":67810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121985,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217,"mean":3.4558888888889,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.4833333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrGBuckingham\/statuses\/907133308416524289","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25092551],"posted_on":"2017-09-11T06:46:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Gavin Buckingham","url":"https:\/\/gavinbuckingham.wordpress.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1443884394\/headshot2_small_normal.JPG","description":"Perception and action researcher examining weight illusions, fingertip force control, and motor learning during object lifting.
