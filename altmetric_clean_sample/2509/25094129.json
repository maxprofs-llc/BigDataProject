The scheme is reformulated as a quadratic program (QP) with equality and bound constraints, which is then solved by a discrete-time recurrent neural network. Simulative verifications based on a six-link planar redundant robot manipulator substantiate the efficacy and accuracy of the presented acceleration fault-tolerant scheme, the resultant QP and the corresponding discrete-time recurrent neural network.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc17","authors":["Jin, Long","Liao, Bolin","Liu, Mei","Xiao, Lin","Guo, Dongsheng","Yan, Xiaogang"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnbot.2017.00050","first_seen_on":"2017-09-11T07:32:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1662-5218"],"journal":"Frontiers in Neurorobotics","last_mentioned_on":1506559886,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnbot.2017.00050\/full","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnbot.2017.00050\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FNINS_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit","https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fnbot.2017.00050\/full"],"pmcid":"PMC5601992","pmid":"28955217","pubdate":"2017-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Different-Level Simultaneous Minimization Scheme for Fault Tolerance of Redundant Manipulator Aided with Discrete-Time Recurrent Neural Network","type":"article","volume":"11"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":6420788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1150661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157333,"mean":11.83258386088,"rank":110738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":29213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157333,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":3.9721232876712,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.5961538461538,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/visitor_z\/statuses\/907144694349668352","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25094129],"posted_on":"2017-09-11T07:32:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Visitor_Z","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/881489306975645696\/vQR8CUQf_normal.jpg","description":"Visitor_Zeus is an #AI, #Science, #Tech, #Data and #Future news flow.","id_on_source":"visitor_z","tweeter_id":"45817618","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":568},"tweet_id":"907144694349668352"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontNeurosci\/statuses\/908466282667769856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25094129],"posted_on":"2017-09-14T23:03:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Neurosci","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Neuroscience","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533283149308911617\/d_MmvG-x_normal.jpeg","description":"The official Twitter Feed for all the latest open-access, peer-reviewed articles in Frontiers in Neuroscience.","id_on_source":"FrontNeurosci","tweeter_id":"397306055","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":15858},"tweet_id":"908466282667769856"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/visitor_z\/statuses\/913204470464630785","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25094129],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T00:51:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Visitor_Z","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/881489306975645696\/vQR8CUQf_normal.jpg","description":"Visitor_Zeus is an #AI, #Science, #Tech, #Data and #Future news flow.","id_on_source":"visitor_z","tweeter_id":"45817618","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":568},"tweet_id":"913204470464630785"}]}}
