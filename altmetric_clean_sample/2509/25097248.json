Inappropriate inflammation is also emerging as a risk factor for trauma-related, anxiety, and affective disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized as persistent re-experiencing of the trauma after a traumatic experience. Traumatic experiences can lead to long-lasting fear memories and fear potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex. The acoustic startle reflex is an ethologically relevant reflex and can be potentiated in both humans and rats through Pavlovian conditioning. Mycobacterium vaccae NCTC 11659 is a soil-derived bacterium with immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory properties that has been demonstrated to confer stress resilience in mice. Here we immunized adult male Sprague Dawley rats 3x, once per week, with a heat-killed preparation of M. vaccae NCTC 11659 (0.1 mg, s.c., in 100 \u00b5l borate buffered saline) or vehicle, and, then, 3 weeks following the final immunization, tested them in the fear-potentiated startle paradigm; controls were maintained under home cage control conditions throughout the experiment (n = 11-12 per group). Rats were tested on days 1 and 2 for baseline acoustic startle, received fear conditioning on days 3 and 4, and underwent fear extinction training on days 5-10. Rats were euthanized on day 11 and brain tissue was sectioned for analysis of mRNA expression for genes important in control of brain serotonergic signaling, including tph2, htr1a, slc6a4, and slc22a3, throughout the brainstem dorsal and median raphe nuclei. Immunization with M. vaccae had no effect on baseline acoustic startle or fear expression on day 5. However, M. vaccae-immunized rats showed enhanced between-session and within-session extinction on day 6, relative to vehicle-immunized controls. Immunization with M. vaccae and fear-potentiated startle altered serotonergic gene expression in a gene- and subregion-specific manner. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that immunoregulatory strategies, such as preimmunization with M. vaccae, have potential for prevention of stress- and trauma-related psychiatric disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000242d","authors":["James H.
