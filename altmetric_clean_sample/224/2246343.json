Herein, we report a new general strategy for label-free sensitive in-solution DNA detection using quantum dot (QD) doping-induced photoluminescence as a fluorogenic reporter system. The dopant mercury (Hg(II)) ions are initially sequestered in the hairpin-structured probe through T-Hg(2+)-T mismatch formation. Upon hybridization with the DNA target, the hairpin is disrupted and Hg(2+) ions are released and incorporated into ZnSe QDs, leading to a dopant-specific emission peak at 560 nm for DNA detection. Unlike the other methods, this method does not require any chemical modification of the DNA probe. It could provide high signal-to-noise ratio, robust single-base mismatch discrimination capability, and 3 orders of magnitude lower limit of detection (LOD) than the traditional molecular beacon (MB)-based fluorescence spectroscopy without any type of amplification. The method could be used for the detection of a variety of clinical significant DNA targets containing single mutations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on applying chemical transformation of inorganic nanostructures to sensitive DNA detection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Xuewen He"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac500590d","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T13:09:29+00:00","issns":["0003-2700"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1396557121,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac500590d"],"pmid":"24627946","pubdate":"2014-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"A General Strategy for Label-Free Sensitive DNA Detection Based on Quantum Dot Doping","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/general-strategy-labelfree-sensitive-dna-detection-based-quantum-dot-doping"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":3104637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":973011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107074,"mean":7.9220359567772,"rank":75223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":23511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107074,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5069,"mean":2.3690552486188,"rank":2669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5069,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":364,"mean":1.3378953168044,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":364,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
