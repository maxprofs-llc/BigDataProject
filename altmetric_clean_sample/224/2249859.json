T1D patients have a greater risk of developing endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Supplementation with cysteine-rich milk proteins has been shown to be beneficial in improving various biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and CVD. This study examines whether L-cysteine (LC) per se prevents monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, a critical step in endothelial dysfunction. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and THP-1 monocytes were pretreated with and without LC (500 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then exposed to ketones (AA or BHB, 0-4 mM) and\/or high glucose (HG) (25 mM) for 24 h. This study shows that LC reduces HG and ketone-induced ROS production, ICAM-1 expression, and the adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. This study provides a biochemical mechanism by which milk protein supplementation can be beneficial in preventing the excess endothelial dysfunction and CVD seen in diabetic patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081d8","authors":["Kanikarla-Marie P","Jain SK","Preeti Kanikarla-Marie","Sushil K.
