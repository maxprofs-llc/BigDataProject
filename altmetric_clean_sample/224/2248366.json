The postprandial glycemic response to equivalent quantities of test food and standard food is compared using Glycemic Index food (GI food). The incremental area under the curve for blood glucose and insulin at fasting, 30, 60, 90 and 120\u00a0min after consumption of different doses (50 and 100\u00a0g) of carbohydrate rich foods like rice and chapatti were compared with standard food, white bread. The GI food value for 50\u00a0g of chapatti and rice was 44 and 11 respectively. The Insulinemic Index food (II food) values, calculated similarly, for 50\u00a0g portion of chapatti and rice were 39 and 6 respectively. Glycemic and insulinemic response showed a dose dependent increase from 50 to 100\u00a0g. Both glycemic and insulinemic impact of chapatti were found to be significantly higher than that of rice (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The GI food and II food values will facilitate qualitative and quantitative judgment about the selection of specific foods for effective metabolic control.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c8c","authors":["Ray KS","Singhania PR"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13197-011-0497-7","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T18:30:56+00:00","issns":["0022-1155"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Food Science and Technology","last_mentioned_on":1396196440,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24493894"],"pmid":"24493894","pubdate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry\/Food Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nutrition","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Glycemic and insulinemic responses to carbohydrate rich whole foods.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glycemic-insulinemic-responses-carbohydrate-rich-whole-foods"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628597,"mean":4.9402458135364,"rank":2016951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":936880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628597,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92696,"mean":7.0524191380335,"rank":48087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":23993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92696,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.5485862068966,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.97,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
