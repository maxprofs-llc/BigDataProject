Great impacts of these methods can be seen for solving the genome related problems of plant and animal kingdom that will open the door of a new era of genomics. This may ultimately overcome the Sanger sequencing that ruled for 30 years. NGS is expected to advance and make the drug discovery process more rapid.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088c9","authors":["Yadav NK","Shukla P","Omer A","Pareek S","Singh RK"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/802437","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T18:18:57+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"","journal":"The Scientific World Journal","last_mentioned_on":1396433033,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24688432?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC3933208","pmid":"24688432","pubdate":"2014-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Next Generation Sequencing: Potential and Application in Drug Discovery.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/next-generation-sequencing-potential-application-drug-discovery-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3567444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107082,"mean":7.9435236689985,"rank":84363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107082,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1319,"mean":1.8320531107739,"rank":854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1319,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":1.2254939759036,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
