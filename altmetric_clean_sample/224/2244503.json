We recently cared for two infants who presented with clinical deterioration. An abnormally placed feeding tube seen on the chest radiograph revealed underlying serious conditions. The first case was an infant 29 weeks of age who presented with right-sided pneumothorax after birth. By history and a right-side-displaced orogastric (OG) tube, iatrogenic esophageal perforation was diagnosed. The second case was a 16-day-old infant who presented with recurrent vomiting. An OG tube extending into a cystic mass at the right cardiophrenic angle resulted in diagnosis of a herniated stomach with organoaxial-type volvulus, which required surgical repair. Both cases recovered uneventfully. As illustrated in these two rare cases, feeding tube position is not only important for feeding practice, but it also has diagnostic implications in newborn infants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056a1","authors":["Hanifi Soylu","Nathan E Wiseman","Yasser El-Sayed","Man Yi","R John Baier"],"doi":"10.1891\/0730-0832.32.2.89","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T08:08:28+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1539-2880"],"issue":"2","journal":"Neonatal Network","last_mentioned_on":1391511818,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23477975?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23477975","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing","perinatology"],"title":"Radiographic confirmation of feeding tube placement: a diagnostic tool identifying gastrointestinal anomalies.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiographic-confirmation-feeding-tube-placement-diagnostic-tool-identifying-gastrointestinal-anomal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616388,"mean":4.9295982487525,"rank":2902791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616388,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92164,"mean":6.8609233423391,"rank":73601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92164,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.1741071428571,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/status\/430657896741736448","license":"public","citation_ids":[2244503],"posted_on":"2014-02-04T11:03:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":158},"tweet_id":"430657896741736448"}]}}
