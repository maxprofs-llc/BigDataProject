This patient had no associated personality disorder (particularly no antisocial disorder) and no substance abuse disorder. Within the 48 h following the gradual introduction of quetiapine (up to 600 mg\/day), the patient presented severe agitation without an environmental explanation, contrasting with the absence of a history of aggressiveness or personality disorder. The diagnoses of manic shift and akathisia were dismissed. The withdrawal and the gradual reintroduction of quetiapine 2 weeks later, which led to another severe agitation, enabled us to attribute the agitation specifically to quetiapine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Fond G","Macgregor A","Ducasse D","Brittner M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.psychres.2014.01.049","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T06:34:19+00:00","issns":["0165-1781"],"issue":"","journal":"Psychiatry Research","last_mentioned_on":1414753218,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24582773?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24582773?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24582773","pubdate":"2014-03-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ireland Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Paradoxical severe agitation induced by add-on high-doses quetiapine in schizo-affective disorder.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paradoxical-severe-agitation-induced-addon-highdoses-quetiapine-schizoaffective-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2318044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2591581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123606,"mean":8.1527912948508,"rank":51407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":68372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123606,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2755,"mean":3.7513144517066,"rank":1112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2755,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":5.3186037735849,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
