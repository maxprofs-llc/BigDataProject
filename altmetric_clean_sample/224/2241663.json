Disruption of these signaling pathways leads to genome instability and cell death, and thus may provide potential novel strategies for cancer therapy. Here, we find that the expression of a human microRNA (miRNA), hsa-miR-185, is downregulated in response to ionizing radiation. Elevation of miR-185 sensitizes renal cell carcinoma cells to X-rays both in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatic analysis shows that the ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase, a master conductor of cellular responses to DNA damage and DNA replication stresses, is a target of miR-185. This prediction was validated by luciferase reporter and mutation assays. We also demonstrated that miR-185 negatively regulates ATR expression at post-transcriptional level. miR-185 enhances radiation-induced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation by repressing ATR pathway. In conclusion, our findings indicate a previously unreported regulatory mechanism for ATR expression mediated by miR-185 and shed light on the potential application of miRNAs both as direct cancer therapeutics and as tools to sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e18","authors":["Wang J","He J","Su F","Ding N","Hu W","Yao B","Wang W","Zhou G"],"doi":"10.1038\/cddis.2013.227","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T07:19:11+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"","journal":"Cell Death & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1393413181,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23807228?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23807228","pubdate":"2013-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["cellbiology","internalmedicine"],"title":"Repression of ATR pathway by miR-185 enhances radiation-induced apoptosis and proliferation inhibition.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/repression-atr-pathway-mir185-enhances-radiationinduced-apoptosis-proliferation-inhibition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3054947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":927955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107089,"mean":7.9775581764533,"rank":72201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":21710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107089,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":651,"mean":4.1433846153846,"rank":459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":651,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.3318604651163,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
