The purpose of this study was to investigate the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of radioiodinated hypericin (Hyp), a naturally occurring compound, after intravenous (i.v.) injection in a rat model of liver and muscle necrosis (n = 42), and evaluate its necrosis affinity. Hyp was labeled with (131)I with labeling efficiency >99%. After incubating in solution\/rat plasma for 8 days, radiochemical purity of (131)I-Hyp remained 98.1 and 97.1%, respectively, indicating good in vitro stability. SPECT-CT images at 24 h after i.v. injection of (131)I-Hyp in rats with induced liver and muscle necrosis showed obvious tracer absorption in necrotic tissues. Biodistribution studies revealed that the percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID\/g) evolved from 1.9 %ID\/g at 6 h, through a maximum 3.0 %ID\/g at 12 h, to 1.0 %ID\/g at 192 h in necrotic liver. Pharmacokinetics studies revealed that the terminal elimination half-life, total body clearance and area under the curve of (131)I-Hyp were 32.7 h, 9.2 L\/h\/kg and 1.6 MBq\/L*h, respectively. These results demonstrated that (131)I-Hyp features a long blood circulation in animals and persistent retention in necrotic tissues. Therefore, (131)I-labeled Hyp could be a broad-spectrum anti-tumor agent with a cost much cheaper relative to the biological agents such as monoclonal antibodies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fc1","authors":["Kong M","Zhang J","Jiang C","Jiang X","Li Y","Gao M","Yao N","Huang D","Wang X","Fang Z","Liu W","Sun Z","Ni Y"],"doi":"10.3109\/1061186x.2013.789034","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T07:12:56+00:00","issns":["1061-186X"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Drug Targeting","last_mentioned_on":1393628468,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23627568?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews"],"pmid":"23627568","pubdate":"2013-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Necrosis affinity evaluation of <sup>131<\/sup>I-hypericin in a rat model of induced necrosis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/necrosis-affinity-evaluation-131ihypericin-rat-model-induced-necrosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":2901445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92749,"mean":7.0455536076251,"rank":73839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92749,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":1.0718636363636,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.325,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
