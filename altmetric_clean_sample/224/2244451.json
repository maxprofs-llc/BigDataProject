Nowadays, a total colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the preferred procedure, which can be performed open or via laparoscopic approach. Since the early '90s, minimally invasive techniques have gained popularity, but the extend of restorative procedures in these patients has restricted the use of laparoscopic approaches mainly to elective procedures in specialised centres. This review discusses the benefits and disadvantages of laparoscopic surgery when compared to open surgery. It presents the current evidence on short-term and long-term post-operative results, functional outcome, fecundity, and costs, for both elective and emergency indications. In addition, the value of new techniques (including single port surgery) and alternative laparoscopic approaches (e.g. ileo-rectal anastomosis, Kock-pouch and appendectomy) will be discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c13","authors":["Buskens CJ","Sahami S","Tanis PJ","Bemelman WA"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bpg.2013.11.007","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T08:07:56+00:00","issns":["1521-6918"],"issue":"1","journal":"Best Practice and Research Clinical Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1391512973,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24485252?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24485252","pubdate":"2014-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"The potential benefits and disadvantages of\u00a0laparoscopic surgery for ulcerative colitis: A\u00a0review of current evidence.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-benefits-disadvantages-oflaparoscopic-surgery-ulcerative-colitis-areview-current-evidence-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":2901437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92749,"mean":7.0455498339589,"rank":73839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92749,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":2.5298322580645,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.8375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":11,"Social Sciences":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/status\/430662740667944960","license":"public","citation_ids":[2244451],"posted_on":"2014-02-04T11:22:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"430662740667944960"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/status\/430661297412132865","license":"public","citation_ids":[2244451],"posted_on":"2014-02-04T11:17:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"430661297412132865"}]}}
