The condition of hydrophobic mismatch occurs when the hydrophobic thickness of a lipid bilayer is significantly different than the length of the membrane spanning segment of a protein, resulting in a mismatch. This mismatch can result in altered function of proteins as well as nonnative structural arrangements including effects on transmembrane \u03b1-helix tilt angles, oligomerization state, and\/or the formation of non-transmembrane topographies. Here, a fluorescence-based protocol is described for testing model transmembrane \u03b1-helices and their sensitivity to hydrophobic mismatch by measuring the propensity of these helices to form non-transmembrane structures. Overall, good hydrophobic matching between the bilayer and transmembrane segments is an important factor that must be considered when designing membrane proteins or peptides.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Caputo GA"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-62703-583-5_5","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T06:57:04+00:00","issns":["1064-3745"],"issue":"","journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1393801273,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23975773?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews"],"pmid":"23975773","pubdate":"2013-08-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Membrane Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Protein Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Analyzing the Effects of Hydrophobic Mismatch on Transmembrane \u03b1-Helices Using Tryptophan Fluorescence Spectroscopy.","type":"article","volume":"1063","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analyzing-effects-hydrophobic-mismatch-transmembrane-%CE%B1helices-using-tryptophan-fluorescence-spectros"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628597,"mean":4.9402458135364,"rank":2903021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628597,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92695,"mean":7.0525456232336,"rank":73849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92695,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2357,"mean":1.420642614601,"rank":1441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2357,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":1.1625,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnxietyNews\/status\/440260565391257600","license":"public","citation_ids":[2240898],"posted_on":"2014-03-02T23:01:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Social Anxiety Help","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/anxietynews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1133209691\/Anxiety-News-Logo_normal.jpg","description":"Latest News, Treatment, Helpful Information For Those Of Us Battling Social Anxiety, GAD, Depression TOGETHER WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER, TOGETHER WE CAN GIVE HOPE!","id_on_source":"AnxietyNews","tweeter_id":"195630483","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":3318},"tweet_id":"440260565391257600"}]}}
