[J Neurotrauma. 2014] - PubMed - NCBI"],"citation":{"abstract":"Abstract This pilot, open-protocol study examined whether scalp application of red and near-infrared (NIR) light-emitting diodes (LED) could improve cognition in patients with chronic, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Application of red\/NIR light improves mitochondrial function (especially in hypoxic\/compromised cells) promoting increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) important for cellular metabolism. Nitric oxide is released locally, increasing regional cerebral blood flow. LED therapy is noninvasive, painless, and non-thermal (cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration [FDA], an insignificant risk device). Eleven chronic, mTBI participants (26-62 years of age, 6 males) with nonpenetrating brain injury and persistent cognitive dysfunction were treated for 18 outpatient sessions (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, for 6 weeks), starting at 10 months to 8 years post- mTBI (motor vehicle accident [MVA] or sports-related; and one participant, improvised explosive device [IED] blast injury). Four had a history of multiple concussions. Each LED cluster head (5.35 cm diameter, 500\u2009mW, 22.2\u2009mW\/cm(2)) was applied for 10\u2009min to each of 11 scalp placements (13\u2009J\/cm(2)). LEDs were placed on the midline from front-to-back hairline; and bilaterally on frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. Neuropsychological testing was performed pre-LED, and at 1 week, and 1 and 2 months after the 18th treatment. A significant linear trend was observed for the effect of LED treatment over time for the Stroop test for Executive Function, Trial 3 inhibition (p=0.004); Stroop, Trial 4 inhibition switching (p=0.003); California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT)-II, Total Trials 1-5 (p=0.003); and CVLT-II, Long Delay Free Recall (p=0.006). Participants reported improved sleep, and fewer post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, if present. Participants and family reported better ability to perform social, interpersonal, and occupational functions. These open-protocol data suggest that placebo-controlled studies are warranted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e7b","authors":["Naeser MA","Zafonte R","Krengel MH","Martin PI","Frazier J","Hamblin M","Knight JA","Meehan W","Baker EH","NaeserMargaret A."],"doi":"10.1089\/neu.2013.3244","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T07:16:08+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["0897-7151","1557-9042"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Neurotrauma","last_mentioned_on":1482523412,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24568233?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24568233?dopt=Citation","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24568233","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24568233","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/neu.2013.3244","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/neu.2013.3244","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/neu.2013.3244"],"pmid":"24568233","pubdate":"2014-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Significant Improvements in Cognitive Performance Post-Transcranial, Red\/Near-Infrared Light-Emitting Diode Treatments in Chronic, Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: Open-Protocol Study","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/significant-improvements-cognitive-performance-posttranscranial-rednearinfrared-lightemitting-diode"},"altmetric_score":{"score":59.572,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":59.572},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":138412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7788573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176558,"mean":7.3967900338137,"rank":3995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":172563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176558,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":941,"mean":8.1139063829787,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":941,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":25.367586206897,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
