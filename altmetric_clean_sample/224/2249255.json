Four to ten percent of children suffer at least one seizure in the first 16 years of life. The incidence is highest in children less than 3 years of age, with a decreasing frequency in older children. Epidemiologic studies reveal that approximately 150,000 children will sustain a first-time unprovoked seizure each year, and of those, 30,000 will develop epilepsy. This article describes the types, diagnoses, and management and disposition of this pediatric neurologic disorder.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c15","authors":["Friedman MJ","Sharieff GQ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pcl.2005.09.010","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T18:50:54+00:00","issns":["00313955"],"issue":"2","journal":"Pediatric clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1395440291,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16574525"],"pmid":"16574525","pubdate":"2006-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Seizures in children.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seizures-children-18"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2669400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1696769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123625,"mean":8.1517214456743,"rank":61599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":45836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123625,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":411,"mean":2.4316536585366,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":411,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.1875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
