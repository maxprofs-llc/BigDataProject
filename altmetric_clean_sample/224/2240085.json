Recently, T helper 17 subset (Th17 cells), which produces IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21 and IL-22, has been implicated in SLE. As CCR6 enriches for Th17 cells, we used this approach to investigate whether CCR6+ memory T helper cells producing IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21 and\/or IL-22 are increased in SLE patients and whether this increase is related to the presence of IFN type I signature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a3","authors":["Brkic Z","Corneth OB","van Helden-Meeuwsen CG","Dolhain RJ","Maria NI","Paulissen SM","Davelaar N","van Hamburg JP","van Daele PL","Dalm VA","van Hagen PM","Hazes JM","Versnel MA","Lubberts E"],"doi":"10.1186\/ar4499","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T05:32:05+00:00","issns":["1478-6354"],"issue":"2","journal":"Arthritis Research & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1440746831,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24598455?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24598455","pubdate":"2014-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Arthritis Research & Therapy","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"T helper 17 cell cytokines and interferon type I: partners in crime in systemic lupus erythematosus?","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thelper-17-cell-cytokines-interferon-type-i-partners-crime-systemic-lupus-erythematosus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5560775,"mean":6.3848950815131,"rank":2945273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1881451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5560775,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133675,"mean":8.2017282343614,"rank":67522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":49435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133675,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1302,"mean":4.4876863950807,"rank":766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1302,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.7064102564103,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
