The complexity of specimen environment has made the management of ESB likewise complex. Through an analysis of the development and management of ESBs worldwide and in light of the sophisticated Internet of Things (IOT) technology, this paper presents IOT technology-based ESB management methods. An IOT technology-based ESB management system can significantly facilitate ESB ingress and egress management as well as long-term storage management under quality control. This paper elaborates on the design of IOT technology-based modules, which can be used in ESB management to achieve standardized, smart, information-based ESB management. ESB management has far-reaching implications for environmental management and for research in environmental science.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Peng L","Wang Q","Yu A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11356-014-2595-3","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T07:41:27+00:00","issns":["0944-1344"],"issue":"","journal":"Environmental Science & Pollution Research","last_mentioned_on":1435220649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24526398?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24526398","pubdate":"2014-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Internet of Things technology-based management methods for environmental specimen banks.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/internet-things-technologybased-management-methods-environmental-specimen-banks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5278180,"mean":6.2101388035557,"rank":2187745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3005153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5278180,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128600,"mean":8.2127624009519,"rank":46776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":79303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128600,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1354,"mean":2.1291219512195,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":1115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1354,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":1.1845454545455,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
