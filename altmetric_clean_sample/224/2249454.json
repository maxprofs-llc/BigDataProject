While NRs regulate genes by direct binding to hormone response elements in the genome, their actions may depend on the activity of other transcription factors (TFs) that may or may not bind DNA. The Kr\u00fcppel-like family of transcription factors (KLF) is an evolutionarily conserved class of DNA-binding proteins that influence many aspects of development and physiology. Several members of this family have been shown to play diverse roles in NR signaling. For example, KLFs (1) act as accessory transcription factors for NR actions, (2) regulate expression of NR genes, and (3) as gene products of primary NR response genes function as key players in NR-dependent transcriptional networks. In mouse models, deletion of different KLFs leads to aberrant transcriptional and physiological responses to hormones, underscoring the importance of these proteins in the regulation of hormonal signaling. Understanding the functional relationships between NRs and KLFs will yield important insights into mechanisms of NR signaling. In this review we present a conceptual framework for understanding how KLFs participate in NR signaling, and we provide examples of how these proteins function to effect hormone action.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002936","authors":["Knoedler JR","Denver RJ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ygcen.2014.03.003","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T18:55:33+00:00","issns":["0016-6480"],"issue":"","journal":"General & Comparative Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1418817063,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24642391","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24642391?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24642391","pubdate":"2014-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Kr\u00fcppel-like factors are effectors of nuclear receptor signaling.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kr%C3%BCppellike-factors-effectors-nuclear-receptor-signaling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4632462,"mean":5.4199858925924,"rank":1860716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2697130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4632462,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108058,"mean":8.1777970330474,"rank":38239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":67630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108058,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":521,"mean":1.7567307692308,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":521,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.2344827586207,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
