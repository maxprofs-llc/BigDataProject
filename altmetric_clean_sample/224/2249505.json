Participants (N = 232) completed a Sexual Health History Calendar (SHHC) assessing behaviors over the previous 12 months, risk self-appraisals, and future behavioral intentions. Youths' narratives included negative self-appraisals (36%), named a risk-related critical incident (13%) or regret (9%), or expressed increased risk awareness (9%) and need for behavior change (18%). A minority were positive (28%) or reflected improvement (7%). All Phase 2 participants (n = 122) identified at least one specific risky behavior they intended to change. These data and the SHHC's visual cues facilitated risk-reduction intervention tailored to the unique circumstances in which each youth's risk taking occurred. For nurses and other providers in clinical settings, the SHHC can offer a critical link between assessment and intervention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002568","authors":["Fisher CM","Lee MG","Boudreau ME"],"doi":"10.1177\/1054773813503968","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T18:56:31+00:00","issns":["1054-7738"],"issue":"","journal":"Clinical Nursing Research","last_mentioned_on":1395309788,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24571964"],"pmid":"24571964","pubdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Using Mixed-Method Assessment to Advance Adolescent HIV Prevention.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-mixedmethod-assessment-advance-adolescent-hiv-prevention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3554183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123624,"mean":8.1517772744557,"rank":82898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123624,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":2.7074647887324,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":6.725,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
