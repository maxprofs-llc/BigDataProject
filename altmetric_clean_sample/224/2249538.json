Ocular drug delivery efficiency depends on the barriers and the clearance from the choroidal, conjunctival vessels and lymphatic. Traditional drug administration reduces the clinical efficacy especially for poor water soluble molecules and for the posterior segment of the eye. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been designed to overcome the barriers, increase the drug penetration at the target site and prolong the drug levels by few internals of drug administrations in lower doses without any toxicity compared to the conventional eye drops. With the aid of high specificity and multifunctionality, DNA NPs can be resulted in higher transfection efficiency for gene therapy. NPs could target at cornea, retina and choroid by surficial applications and intravitreal injection. This review is concerned with recent findings and applications of NPs drug delivery systems for the treatment of different eye diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Hong-Yan Zhou","Ji-Long Hao","Shuang Wang","Yu Zheng","Wen-Song Zhang"],"doi":"10.3980\/j.issn.2222-3959.2013.03.25","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T18:57:33+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1395287537,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3693026\/pdf\/ijo-06-03-390.pdf"],"pmid":"23826539","pubdate":"2014-04-04T20:13:00+00:00","publisher":"Press of International Journal of Ophthalmology","startpage":"390","title":"Nanoparticles in the ocular drug delivery","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanoparticles-ocular-drug-delivery-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
