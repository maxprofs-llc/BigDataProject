[Mikrobiyol Bul 2013; 47(2):382], with a great interest. Today, gram-negative enteric bacteria expressing NDM-1 are spreading rapidly all over the world and this is of great concern when increasing carbapenem resistance is considered. Yan\u0131k et al. reported that there were no NDM-1 positive isolates in their study involving a part of Turkey. It is well-known that the most sensitive indicator related to carbapenem resistance is ertapenem resistance [Per\u00e7in et al. Mikrobiyol Bul 2012; 46(4):546]. In their study Yan\u0131k et al. used imipenem, meropenem or doripenem instead of ertapenem resistance for screening carbapenem resistance. Thus, carbapenem-resistant strains might be unnoticed in their study. They also used Modified Hodge Test (MHT) for the investigation of carbapenem resistance in the second stage of their study. MHT is known to have a low sensitivity as a screening test for NDM-1 positive strains. To increase its sensitivity, ZnSO4 should be added to the culture medium [Girlich et al. J Clin Microbiol 2012; 50(2):477]. However, this issue was not specified in Yan\u0131k et al's study. Thus, this may be another possible cause of failure to detect NDM-1 expressing strains. Yan\u0131k et al. reported in their study that NDM-1-producing isolates were not detected in Turkey. However, very recently, four NDM-1 isolates which were not associated with importation from abroad, were reported in a study from Turkey [Alp et al. J Hosp Infect 2013; 84(2):178] and this was the first report of domestic NDM-1 secreting strains in Turkey. In conclusion, there is a need in our country to a carbapenem group antibiotic investigate the presence of NDM-1 positive strains. The use of ertapenem for screening carbapenem resistance and also adding ZnSO4 to MHT for the detection of NDM-1 strains are of great importance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd43","authors":["Hatipo\u011flu M","Turhan V"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T07:53:05+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Mikrobiyoloji b\u00fclteni","last_mentioned_on":1392154879,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24506731?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24506731","pubdate":"2014-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"[Notice of fi rst NDM-1 expressing isolates in Turkey and the use of modifi ed Hodge test].","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/notice-first-ndm1-expressing-isolates-turkey-modified-hodge-test"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627970,"mean":4.9447382433571,"rank":2904889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627970,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92629,"mean":7.0566072677809,"rank":73849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92629,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":0.7984126984127,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.75,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ndm1bacteria\/status\/433355090435375105","license":"public","citation_ids":[2243537],"posted_on":"2014-02-11T21:41:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.ndm1bacteria.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1294321879\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ndm1bacteria","tweeter_id":"177368473","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":545},"tweet_id":"433355090435375105"}]}}
