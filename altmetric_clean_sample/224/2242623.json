Determination of their prevalence is essential to formulate an effective antibiotic policy and hospital infection control measures. Present study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of ESBL and AmpC \u03b2L producers in ICU of a tertiary care center.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008128","authors":["Grover N","Sahni AK","Bhattacharya S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mjafi.2012.02.001","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T07:35:50+00:00","issns":["0377-1237"],"issue":"1","journal":"Medical Journal Armed Forces India","last_mentioned_on":1392795073,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24532926?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC3862620","pmid":"24532926","pubdate":"2014-02-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Therapeutic challenges of ESBLS and AmpC beta-lactamase producers in a tertiary care center.","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/therapeutic-challenges-esbls-ampc-betalactamase-producers-tertiary-care-center"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
