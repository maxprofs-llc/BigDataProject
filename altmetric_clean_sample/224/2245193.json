The injection of MN with alcohol has gained popularity over the past 10 years with widespread media coverage. Many surgeons have anecdotally questioned the long-term effectiveness of this treatment. We reviewed a cohort of patients at an average 5-year follow-up to assess the medium-term results of alcohol injection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058ee","authors":["Gurdezi S","White T","Ramesh P","Sabahat Gurdezi","Thomas White","Palanisamy Ramesh"],"doi":"10.1177\/1071100713489555","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T08:46:09+00:00","issns":["1071-1007","1944-7876"],"issue":"8","journal":"Foot & Ankle International","last_mentioned_on":1463217247,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23669161\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/1071100713489555","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23669161"],"pmid":"23669161","pubdate":"2013-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Alcohol Injection for Morton's Neuroma: A Five-Year Follow-Up.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alcohol-injection-morton039s-neuroma-fiveyear-followup"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695064,"mean":6.6060460035168,"rank":1441760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6223579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695064,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175438,"mean":7.356407553709,"rank":34477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":140327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175438,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":550,"mean":5.0328342440801,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":550,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.2285714285714,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
