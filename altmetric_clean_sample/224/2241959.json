Although DARC has been shown to play a role in many inflammatory diseases, its effect on chronic venous disease (CVD) remains unidentified. We explored whether the expression of DARC in skin tissue was activated under venous hypertension as well as the relationships between DARC and inflammation. Materials and methods: The inflammation in a rat model of venous hypertension caused by a femoral arterial-venous fistula (AVF) was studied. At specified intervals the pressure in the femoral veins was recorded within 42 days. Hindlimb skin specimens were harvested at different time points. The expressions of DARC, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in skin tissue were examined. Mononuclear cells infiltrated in skin tissue were detected. Results: Femoral venous pressures in AVF groups increased significantly at different time points (P < 0.01). DARC was expressed in skin tissue and its expression level increased significantly in AVF groups from the 7nd day on and was enhanced in a time-dependent manner within 42 days (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, both MCP-1 and IL-8 had higher levels, accompanied by increased mononuclear cells infiltrating into skin tissue (P < 0.05). Conclusions: A rat AVF model which can maintain venous hypertension for at least 42 days is competent for researching the pathogenesis of CVD. DARC, which plays a role in the inflammation of skin tissue under venous hypertension, may become a new molecular target for diagnosis and treatment of CVD at a very early stage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c53","authors":["Huang W","Qin W","Lv L","Deng H","Zhang H","Zhang J","Zhang L"],"doi":"10.1024\/0301-1526\/a000327","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T07:23:25+00:00","issns":["0301-1526"],"issue":"1","journal":"VASA Zeitschrift fuer Gefaesskrankheiten","last_mentioned_on":1393326248,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24429330?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24429330","pubdate":"2014-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Duffy antigen \/ receptor for chemokines correlates with inflammatory reaction in rats with venous hypertension: implication for the pathogenesis of primary chronic venous disease.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/duffy-antigen-receptor-chemokines-correlates-inflammatory-reaction-rats-venous-hypertension-implicat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627536,"mean":4.9480380313392,"rank":2906107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627536,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92575,"mean":7.0502605699225,"rank":73838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92575,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":1.6488363636364,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.3125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/status\/438268169585573889","license":"public","citation_ids":[2241959],"posted_on":"2014-02-25T11:04:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"438268169585573889"}]}}
