The aim of this study is to analyze the determinants of unprotected sex among sailors in Senegal. A descriptive and analytical study was conducted among sailors of the merchant navy. Data on knowledge, attitudes and practices were collected during a personal interview. A multivariate analysis was performed using a multiple logistic regression. A total of 400 sailors were interviewed, 57.9% had casual sex of whom 23.7% were not protected. Sexual intercourse without protection was more common among the uneducated (OR = 2.29 [1.23 to 5.99]) and married (OR = 2.29 [1.23-5.99]). Sailors who thought that using condom reduces pleasure during sexual intercourse (OR = 2.5 [1.2-5.1]) and those who consumed alcohol (OR = 5.4 [2.07-14.2]) were less protected during casual sex. Sexual contact is one of the main modes of transmission of HIV \/ AIDS. Sailors often have unprotected sex. Interventions using specific ways must be performed taking into account the mobility of these men who are often uneducated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006d3d","authors":["Faye A","Faye MD","Leye MM","Diongue M","Niang K","Camara MD","Tal-Dia A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13149-014-0353-x","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T18:45:08+00:00","issns":["0037-9085"],"issue":"","journal":"Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de pathologie exotique","last_mentioned_on":1397201859,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24639134"],"pmid":"24639134","pubdate":"2014-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"[Study of determinants of unprotected sex in sailors of the Senegalese merchant navy.]","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tude-des-dterminants-des-rapports-sexuels-non-protgs-chez-les-marins-la-marine-marchande-sngalaise"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2495450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2389263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123199,"mean":8.1788107436811,"rank":56771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":62244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123199,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":1.934785046729,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.75769230769231,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hlth_Literacy\/status\/447988741551185920","license":"public","citation_ids":[2249037],"posted_on":"2014-03-24T06:50:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Health Literacy","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731064960\/LiteracyII_normal.jpg","description":"Eclectic health info, Health Literacy  Also @HIV_Insight @Prison_Health, @Why_We_Do_That, @Sex_Worker_Hlth","id_on_source":"Hlth_Literacy","tweeter_id":"77314206","geo":{"lt":21.30694,"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US"},"followers":6049},"tweet_id":"447988741551185920"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MauriceGreenham\/status\/454523656555999232","license":"datasift","rt":["HIV_Insight"],"citation_ids":[2249037],"posted_on":"2014-04-11T07:37:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Maurice Greenham","url":"https:\/\/maurice-greenham.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/671636271295430656\/Vt8YYl4T_normal.png","description":"Gay man long term HIV Musician, writer, actor...globetrotting linguist...loves good music, books, architecture, history.
