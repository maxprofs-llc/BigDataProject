This is an important question, as mental illness is estimated to co-occur in 37% of individuals with an alcohol use disorder and in more than 50% of individuals with a drug use disorder. The goal of this study was to explore differences in self-reported alcohol and\/or drug use in patients with and without mental illness diagnoses six months after receiving BI in a hospital emergency department (ED).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f610000463","authors":["Krupski A","Sears JM","Joesch JM","Estee S","He L","Huber A","Dunn C","Roy-Byrne P","Ries R"],"doi":"10.1186\/1940-0640-7-24","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T07:53:20+00:00","issns":["1940-0632"],"issue":"1","journal":"Addiction Science & Clinical Practice","last_mentioned_on":1392138818,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23186062?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23186062","pubdate":"2012-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychopharmacology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Self-reported alcohol and drug use six months after brief intervention: do changes in reported use vary by mental-health status?","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfreported-alcohol-drug-six-months-after-brief-intervention-changes-reported-vary-mentalhealth-sta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":2015226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93015,"mean":7.0240309845832,"rank":48108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93015,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":3.6308888888889,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":2,"Psychology":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RoanokeTavern\/status\/433287723848196097","license":"public","citation_ids":[2243557],"posted_on":"2014-02-11T17:13:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Stephen","url":"http:\/\/q.gs\/23c1R","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2358584914\/7mqo0ezv5agzqk2frzmq_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"RoanokeTavern","tweeter_id":"176353026","geo":{"lt":47.57065,"ln":-122.22207,"country":"US"},"followers":2357},"tweet_id":"433287723848196097"}]}}
