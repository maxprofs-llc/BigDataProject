Both 2-HDG and 2-HDM have an identical hydrophobic chain (C16), but the former consists a monosaccharide glucose head group, in contrast to the latter which has a disaccharide maltose unit. Consequently, their hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) is different. The results obtained have shown that these branched-chain alkyl glycosides affect differently the stability of the nano-emulsions. Compared to the model nano-emulsion, the presence of 2-HDG reduces the oil droplet size, whereas 2-HDM modify the properties of the model nano-emulsion system in terms of its droplet size and storage time stability at high temperature. These nano-emulsions have been proven capable of encapsulating ketoprofen, showing a fast release of almost 100% in 24h. Thus, both synthetically prepared branched-chain alkyl glycosides with mono- and disaccharide sugar head groups are suitable as nano-emulsion stabilizing agents and as drug delivery systems in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002593","authors":["Ahmad N","Ramsch R","Llin\u00e0s M","Solans C","Hashim R","Tajuddin HA"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.colsurfb.2013.12.013","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T07:02:14+00:00","issns":["0927-7765"],"issue":"","journal":"Colloids & Surfaces B: Biointerfaces","last_mentioned_on":1418667253,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24384142?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24384142","pubdate":"2014-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
