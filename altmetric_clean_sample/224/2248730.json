Participants were recruited using respondent driven sampling. Thirty-five percent of participants had healthcare coverage and 43% had a usual formal source of care. Healthcare coverage was primarily through the local indigent healthcare program and most of those with a usual formal source of care received care at a public healthcare clinic. Having healthcare coverage and having a usual formal source of care were both associated with older age; having a usual formal source of care was also marginally associated with increased time of residence in the US and increased income security. The primary barriers to healthcare use were not having money or insurance, not knowing where to go, and not having transportation. Healthcare interventions may benefit from targeting young and newly arrived immigrants and addressing the structural and belief barriers that impede undocumented immigrant women's use of healthcare services.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dee","authors":["Montealegre JR","Selwyn BJ"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10903-012-9754-8","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T18:39:19+00:00","issns":["1557-1912"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Immigrant & Minority Health","last_mentioned_on":1397347992,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23224739"],"pmid":"23224739","pubdate":"2012-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer New York LLC","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","socialsciences"],"title":"Healthcare Coverage and Use Among Undocumented Central American Immigrant Women in Houston, Texas.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/healthcare-coverage-among-undocumented-central-american-immigrant-women-houston-texas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028115,"mean":5.9640561526634,"rank":2654036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1717364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028115,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123970,"mean":8.1128177528256,"rank":61272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":46951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123970,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":432,"mean":2.3510580046404,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":432,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.6269230769231,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
