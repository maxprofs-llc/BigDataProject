Host defense peptides (HDPs) constitute critically important components of innate immunity with both antimicrobial and immune regulatory activities. We previously showed that a chicken HDP, namely fowlicidin-1(6-26), has potent antibacterial activities in vitro and in vivo. Here we further revealed that fowl-1(6-26) possesses strong immunomodulatory properties. The peptide is chemotactic specifically to neutrophils, but not monocytes or lymphocytes, after injected into the mouse peritoneum. Fowl-1(6-26) also has the capacity to activate macrophages by inducing the expression of inflammatory mediators including IL-1\u03b2, CCL2, and CCL3. However, unlike bacterial lipopolysaccharide that triggers massive production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, fowl-1(6-26) only marginally increased their expression in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages. Additionally, fowl-1(6-26) enhanced the surface expression of MHC II and CD86 on RAW264.7 cells, suggesting that it may facilitate development of adaptive immune response. Indeed, co-immunization of mice with chicken ovalbumin (OVA) and fowl-1(6-26) augmented both OVA-specific IgG1 and IgG2a titers, relative to OVA alone. We further showed that fowl-1(6-26) is capable of preventing a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection due to its enhancement of host defense. All mice survived from an otherwise lethal infection when the peptide was administered 1-2 days prior to MRSA infection, and 50% mice were protected if receiving the peptide 4 days before infection. Taken together, with a strong capacity to stimulate innate and adaptive immunity, fowl-1(6-26) may have potential to be developed as a novel antimicrobial and a vaccine adjuvant.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003116","authors":["Bommineni YR","Pham GH","Sunkara LT","Achanta M","Zhang G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molimm.2014.01.004","endpage":"63","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T07:56:14+00:00","issns":["0161-5890","01615890"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1392099849,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24491488?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24491488","pubdate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"55","subjects":["molecularbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Immune regulatory activities of fowlicidin-1, a cathelicidin host defense peptide.","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immune-regulatory-activities-fowlicidin1-cathelicidin-host-defense-peptide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":2742351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":729580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92805,"mean":7.0383476574288,"rank":70024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92805,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":586,"mean":2.0777846153846,"rank":495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":586,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.6,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
