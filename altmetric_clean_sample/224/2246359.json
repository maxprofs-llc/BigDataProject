The links between self-perception, self-regulation in problem-solving and metacognition are investigated. Overall self-perception and self-perception of competences by domain do not differ significantly between the two groups. Self-perception of competences in specific domains, self-regulation and metacognition vary depending on MA and verbal comprehension in the two groups. ID adolescents attribute more importance to social acceptance than TD children. In both groups, positive links are identified between self-perception and importance attributed to domains. Performance, self-regulation and metacognition are lower in ID adolescents than in TD children. Positive links are obtained between self-perception of competences in specific domains and certain self-regulatory and metacognitive strategies, although these links differ in the two groups.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003464","doi":"10.1016\/j.ridd.2014.03.033","first_seen_on":"2014-04-04T13:13:58+00:00","issns":["08914222"],"journal":"Research in Developmental Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1396560696,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0891422214001255"],"pmid":"24705487","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Self-perception, self-regulation and metacognition in adolescents with intellectual disability","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfperception-selfregulation-metacognition-adolescents-intellectual-disability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506837,"mean":5.127001515923,"rank":3534101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":134992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506837,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107075,"mean":7.9234861497657,"rank":83685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107075,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":997,"mean":2.3967751004016,"rank":754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":997,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":4.00875,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
