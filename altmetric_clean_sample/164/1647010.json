Advances in understanding the molecular pathology of these diseases, the evolution of vector technology, as well as defining the targets for therapeutic interventions has placed these conditions within the reach of gene-based therapy. One of the cornerstones of limiting the effectiveness of gene therapy is the establishment of clinically relevant methods of genetic transfer. Recently there have been advances in direct and transvascular gene delivery methods with the use of new technologies. Current research efforts in IHD are focused primarily on the stimulation of angiogenesis, modify the coronary vascular environment and improve endothelial function with localized gene-eluting catheters and stents. In contrast to standard IHD treatments, gene therapy in HF primarily targets inhibition of apoptosis, reduction in adverse remodeling and increase in contractility through global cardiomyocyte transduction for maximal efficacy. This article will review a variety of gene-transfer strategies in models of coronary artery disease and HF and discuss the relative success of these strategies in improving the efficiency of vector-mediated cardiac gene delivery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002934","authors":["M G Katz","A S Fargnoli","L A Pritchette","C R Bridges"],"doi":"10.1038\/gt.2012.11","first_seen_on":"2013-07-24T23:18:25+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["0969-7128","1476-5462"],"journal":"Gene Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1381525473,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/gt.2012.11","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/gt\/journal\/v19\/n6\/full\/gt201211a.html"],"pmid":"22418063","pubdate":"2012-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Gene delivery technologies for cardiac applications","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-delivery-technologies-cardiac-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":1532667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1994800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85549,"mean":7.4376555617899,"rank":30652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":52615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85549,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":412,"mean":3.5365936739659,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":412,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.685,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
