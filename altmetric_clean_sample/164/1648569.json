Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of eight clonal types among the 15 ESBL producers. Multilocus sequence typing of two isolates harboured blaIMP-1 identified the clonal strain as ST325. All these genes were found either alone or simultaneously in the strains in the following five different arrangements:<blaOXA-10>; <blaOXA-10, blaIMP-1>; <blaPER-1, blaOXA-10>; <blaPER-1, blaPSE-1>; <blaOXA-10, blaTEM-1>. Regarding mutation-driven resistance, all, but four of the isolates had a relevant decrease of oprD expression. In addition, 73.3% of the isolates overexpressed mexB, 40% mexD, and 33.3% mexY. A specific combination of overexpressed mexB or mexY and alteration in loop L710 of OprD were significantly associated with meropenem resistance. In conclusion, combination of several mutation-driven mechanisms leading to OprD inactivation and overexpression of efflux systems was the main carbapenem resistance mechanism among the ESBL-producing P. aeruginosa isolates, but acquisition of a transferable resistance determinant such as metallo-\u03b2-lactamase could be problematic in clinical settings in China.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c2","authors":["Liu Y","Li XY","Wan LG","Jiang WY","Li FQ","Yang JH"],"doi":"10.1089\/mdr.2013.0010","first_seen_on":"2013-07-25T10:50:07+00:00","issns":["1076-6294"],"issue":"","journal":"Microbial Drug Resistance: Mechanism, Epidemiology, & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1374749342,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23865862?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23865862","pubdate":"2013-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Efflux System Overexpression and Decreased OprD Contribute to the Carbapenem Resistance Among Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-Producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolates from a Chinese University Hospital.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efflux-system-overexpression-decreased-oprd-contribute-carbapenem-resistance-among-extendedspectrum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":2898834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85796,"mean":7.3775787633314,"rank":68246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85796,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":2.4291147540984,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.875,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
