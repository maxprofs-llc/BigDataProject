Curcumin is a traditional medicine used for treatment of a wide variety of tumors. However, antimetastasis mechanism of curcumin on CRC has not yet been completely investigated. Here, we explored the underlying molecular mechanisms of curcumin on metastasis of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Curcumin significantly inhibits cell migration, invasion, and colony formation in vitro and reduces tumor growth and liver metastasis in vivo. We found that curcumin suppresses Sp-1 transcriptional activity and Sp-1 regulated genes including ADEM10, calmodulin, EPHB2, HDAC4, and SEPP1 in CRC cells. Curcumin inhibits focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and enhances the expressions of several extracellular matrix components which play a critical role in invasion and metastasis. Curcumin reduces CD24 expression in a dose-dependent manner in CRC cells. Moreover, E-cadherin expression is upregulated by curcumin and serves as an inhibitor of EMT. These results suggest that curcumin executes its antimetastasis function through downregulation of Sp-1, FAK, and CD24 and by promoting E-cadherin expression in CRC cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Chen, Chun-Chieh"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/541695","first_seen_on":"2013-07-24T00:09:09+00:00","issns":["1741-427X"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1374638492,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2013\/541695\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2013\/541695.pdf","pmid":"23970932","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Curcumin Suppresses Metastasis via Sp-1, FAK Inhibition, and E-Cadherin Upregulation in Colorectal Cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/curcumin-suppresses-metastasis-via-sp1-fak-inhibition-ecadherin-upregulation-colorectal-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":925782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3565127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90448,"mean":7.5544186319062,"rank":22504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":67605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90448,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2941,"mean":3.3559469387755,"rank":546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2941,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.3368888888889,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
