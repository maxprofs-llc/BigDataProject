Consequently, a number of systematic reviews incorporating these new results have been published that have consistently demonstrated an increased risk of death and use of RRT associated with HES solutions, regardless of type of HES and dose administered, both in general intensive care patients and in those with severe sepsis. These effects become apparent in the post-resuscitation period and may relate to increased tissue accumulation associated with HES. These results question the clinical role of semi-synthetic colloids for fluid resuscitation and mandate a reappraisal about how these fluids are administered to critically ill patients, specifically considering the potential for toxicity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002af6","authors":["Myburgh J","McIntyre L"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00134-013-2890-3","endpage":"1001","first_seen_on":"2013-07-24T22:41:31+00:00","issns":["0342-4642","1432-1238"],"issue":"6","journal":"Intensive Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1372377600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00134-013-2890-3"],"pmid":"23559078","pubdate":"2013-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Anesthesiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pneumology\/Respiratory System","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"998","subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"New insights into fluid resuscitation","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-insights-fluid-resuscitation-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633617,"mean":4.9215564192856,"rank":2015198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633617,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85770,"mean":7.3720385453954,"rank":44585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":23229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85770,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":961,"mean":3.03885,"rank":507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":961,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":2.8861666666667,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
