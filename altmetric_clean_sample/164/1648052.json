The heat production of a runner is the product of its energy cost of running (C r) by its velocity. Since C r varies greatly among humans, those individuals with high C r are more exposed to heat stress in warm and humid conditions. Although risk factor awareness is crucial to the prevention of heat stroke and potential fatalities associated therewith, how C r affects the highest sustainable velocity (V) at which maximal heat loss matches heat production has not been quantified to date.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000733b","doi":"10.1007\/s00421-013-2696-6","first_seen_on":"2013-07-25T07:25:58+00:00","issns":["1439-6327"],"journal":"European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1374812243,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23877484\/?i=1&from=eur%20j%20appl%20physiol"],"pmid":"23877484","pubdate":"2013-07-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Occupational Medicine\/Industrial Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Influence of individual energy cost on running capacity in warm, humid environments.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-individual-energy-cost-running-capacity-warm-humid-environments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060070,"mean":6.2771577408069,"rank":2669774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4351112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060070,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123254,"mean":6.7658942500386,"rank":37632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":84719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123254,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1947,"mean":8.3579568345324,"rank":1014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1947,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":12.753225806452,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
