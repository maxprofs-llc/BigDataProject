We explored the unique contribution of EI dimensions (Attention, Clarity and Repair) on individuals' psychological well-being, after controlling for the influence of general self-efficacy and socio-demographic variables (age, gender and culture). Data was collected from a sample of 1078 Spanish, Mexican, Portuguese and Brazilian undergraduate students (M(age) = 22.98; SD = 6.73) and analyzed using hierarchical multiple regressions. Results indicated that overall EI dimensions (especially Clarity and Repair) accounted for unique variance on psychological well-being above and beyond general self-efficacy and socio-demographic characteristics. These findings provide additional support for the validity of perceived EI, and suggests that EI components contribute to important well-being criteria independently from well-known constructs such as self-efficacy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6ef3cf058f61000a065","authors":["Costa H","Ripoll P","S\u00e1nchez M","Carvalho C"],"doi":"10.1017\/sjp.2013.39","first_seen_on":"2013-07-25T22:48:52+00:00","issns":["1138-7416"],"issue":"","journal":"Spanish Journal of Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1374792524,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23866247"],"pmid":"23866247","pubdate":"2013-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Emotional intelligence and self-efficacy: effects on psychological well-being in college students.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emotional-intelligence-selfefficacy-effects-psychological-wellbeing-college-students-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620976,"mean":4.929557539064,"rank":2016101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":927651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620976,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85440,"mean":7.4396626130925,"rank":44661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":22747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85440,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":2.4294252873563,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
