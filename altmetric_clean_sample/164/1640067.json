This sexual risk behaviour is commonly associated with age mixing, concurrency and unsafe sex. It is often described as a survival- or consumption-driven behaviour. South Africa's history of political oppression as well as the globalization-related economic policies adopted post-apartheid, are suggested as the underlying contexts within which high risk behaviours occur among Black populations. What remains unclear is how these factors combine to affect the particular ways in which transactional sex is used to negotiate life among young Black women in the country.In this paper we explore the drivers of transactional sex among young women aged 16-24, who reside in a peri-urban community in South Africa. We also interrogate prevailing constructions of the risk behaviour in the context of modernity, widespread availability of commodities, and wealth inequalities in the country.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000825","authors":["Yanga Z Zembe","Loraine Townsend","Anna Thorson","Anna Mia Ekstr\u00f6m"],"doi":"10.1186\/1744-8603-9-28","first_seen_on":"2013-07-22T19:17:33+00:00","issns":["1744-8603",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Globalization and Health","last_mentioned_on":1438359634,"links":["http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/9\/1\/28\/abstract","http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/pdf\/1744-8603-9-28.pdf","http:\/\/globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1744-8603-9-28"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/pdf\/1744-8603-9-28.pdf","pmid":"23866170","pubdate":"2013-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"28","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"title":"\u201cMoney talks, bullshit walks\u201d interrogating notions of consumption and survival sex among young women engaging in transactional sex in post-apartheid South Africa: a qualitative enquiry","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/money-talks-bullshit-walks-interrogating-notions-consumption-survival-sex-among-young-women-engaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8283873,"mean":6.9847321887572,"rank":920716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7361966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8283873,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128106,"mean":7.1117226337771,"rank":15334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":112749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128106,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":480,"mean":15.903202505219,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":480,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":7.3727272727273,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":11,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
