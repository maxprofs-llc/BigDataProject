The molecular chaperone network that supports prion propagation in the cell has seen a great progress in the last decade. However, the cellular machinery to activate or deactivate the prion states remains an enigma, largely due to insufficient knowledge of prion-regulating factors. Here, we report that overexpression of a [PSI(+) ]-inducible Q\/N-rich protein, Lsm4, eliminates the three major prions [PSI(+) ], [URE3], and [RNQ(+) ]. Subcloning analysis revealed that the Q\/N-rich region of Lsm4 is responsible for the prion loss. Lsm4 formed an amyloid in vivo, which seemed to play a crucial role in the prion elimination. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy analysis revealed that in the course of the Lsm4-driven [PSI(+) ] elimination, the [PSI(+) ] aggregates undergo a size increase, which ultimately results in the formation of conspicuous foci in otherwise [psi(-) ]-like mother cells. We also found that the antiprion activity is a general property of [PSI(+) ]-inducible factors. These data provoked a novel \"unified\" model that explains both prion induction and elimination by a single scheme.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"53222dc92a83ee27268b4587","authors":["Oishi, Keita","Kurahashi, Hiroshi","Pack, Chan\u2010Gi","Sako, Yasushi","Nakamura, Yoshikazu"],"doi":"10.1002\/mbo3.83","first_seen_on":"2013-07-24T22:35:36+00:00","issns":["","2045-8827"],"issue":"3","journal":"MicrobiologyOpen","last_mentioned_on":1373328000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/mbo3.83"],"pmid":"23512891","pubdate":"2013-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"A bipolar functionality of Q\/N\u2010rich proteins: Lsm4 amyloid causes clearance of yeast prions","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bipolar-functionality-qnrich-proteins-lsm4-amyloid-causes-clearance-yeast-prions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":2017574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85612,"mean":7.4122082209063,"rank":44688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":22910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85612,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":4.5704601769912,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
