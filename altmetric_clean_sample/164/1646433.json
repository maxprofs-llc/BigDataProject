Higher fetal globin expression within genotypes reduces globin imbalance and ameliorates anaemia. Sodium 2,2 dimethylbutyrate (HQK-1001), an orally bioavailable short-chain fatty acid derivative, induces \u03b3-globin expression experimentally and is well-tolerated in normal subjects. Accordingly, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase I\/II trial was performed in 21 adult BTI patients (14 with HbE\/\u03b2(0) thalassaemia and seven with \u03b2(+)\/\u03b2(0) thalassaemia intermedia, to determine effective doses for fetal globin induction, safety, and tolerability. HQK-1001 or placebo were administered once daily for 8 weeks at four dose levels (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg\/kg per day), and subjects were monitored for laboratory and clinical events. Pharmacokinetic profiles demonstrated a t(1\/2) of 10-12 h. Adverse events with HQK-1001 treatment were not significantly different from placebo treatment. The 20 mg\/kg treatment doses increased median HbF above baseline levels by 6\u00b76% and 4\u00b74 g\/l (P < 0\u00b701) in 8\/9 subjects; total haemoglobin (Hb) increased by a mean of 11 g\/l in 4\/9 subjects. These findings identified a safe oral therapeutic which induces fetal globin in BTI. Further investigation of HQK-1001 with longer dosing to definitively evaluate its haematological potential appears warranted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002446","authors":["Fucharoen, Suthat","Inati, Adlette","Siritanaratku, Noppadol","Thein, Swee L.","Wargin, William C.","Koussa, Suzanne","Taher, Ali","Chaneim, Nattawara","Boosalis, Michael","Berenson, Ronald","Perrine, Susan P."],"doi":"10.1111\/bjh.12304","first_seen_on":"2013-07-24T22:41:05+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["0007-1048","1365-2141"],"issue":"4","journal":"British Journal of Haematology","last_mentioned_on":1366675200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/bjh.12304"],"pmid":"23530969","pubdate":"2013-03-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"A randomized phase I\/II trial of HQK\u20101001, an oral fetal globin gene inducer, in \u03b2\u2010thalassaemia intermedia and HbE\/\u03b2\u2010thalassaemia","type":"article","volume":"161","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/randomized-phase-iii-trial-hqk1001-oral-fetal-globin-gene-inducer-%CE%B2thalassaemia-intermedia-hbe%CE%B2thala"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631865,"mean":4.925550910502,"rank":2015225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":944468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631865,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85733,"mean":7.3800108477583,"rank":44601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":23160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85733,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1284,"mean":2.1161044427124,"rank":753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1284,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.25625,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
