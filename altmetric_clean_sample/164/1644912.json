The ability to reduce unintended pregnancy depends on making family planning services available to all. A comprehensive approach requires policy change to improve funding for and access to family planning, to provide comprehensive sex education and to reduce insurance and religious barriers to contraceptives.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005bcc","authors":["Espey E","Cosgrove E","Ogburn T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ogc.2007.02.002","first_seen_on":"2013-07-24T12:28:07+00:00","issns":["0889-8545"],"issue":"1","journal":"Obstetrics and gynecology clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1374667402,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17472861"],"pmid":"17472861","pubdate":"2007-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Family planning American style: why it's so hard to control birth in the US.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/family-planning-american-style-so-hard-control-birth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7939687,"mean":6.711854353932,"rank":6019591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1067768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7939687,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126736,"mean":6.9088696887207,"rank":81828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126736,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":3.9413947368421,"rank":120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Social Sciences":4,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/malcscot\/statuses\/360007296190914563","license":"public","citation_ids":[1644912],"posted_on":"2013-07-24T12:03:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Malcolm Scott","url":"http:\/\/linkd.in\/KaS9Vm","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/624792447948865536\/K_V1egX__normal.png","description":"A News Feed For Current Events, Mostly In Africa And The Middle East, As Well As American Politics And Public Policy From A Progressive Perspective","id_on_source":"malcscot","tweeter_id":"385120105","geo":{"lt":43.15478,"ln":-77.61556,"country":"US"},"followers":275},"tweet_id":"360007296190914563"}]}}
