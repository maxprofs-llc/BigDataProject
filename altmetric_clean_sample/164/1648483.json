The P&G model also invokes an unnecessarily complex set of mechanisms. We show that a computational implementation, currently in development and based on a simpler model, can account for more of this type of dialogue data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023a1","doi":"10.1017\/s0140525x12002592","first_seen_on":"2013-07-25T10:05:45+00:00","issns":["1469-1825"],"issue":"04","journal":"Behavioral & Brain Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1374746736,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8958220"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S0140525X12002592","pmid":"23790009","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"359","subjects":["brain","psychology","neurology"],"title":"\u201cWell, that's one way\u201d: Interactivity in parsing and production","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thats-one-way-interactivity-parsing-production"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3560557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90474,"mean":7.5623941728473,"rank":73041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90474,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":804,"mean":8.1086799501867,"rank":639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":804,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.5625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
