Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a pivotal enzyme responsible for a major drug oxidation polymorphism in human populations. Distribution of CYP2D6 in brain and its role in serotonin metabolism suggest that CYP2D6 may have a function in the central nervous system. 2. To establish an efficient and accurate platform for the study of CYP2D6 in vivo, a human CYP2D6 (Tg-2D6) model was generated by transgenesis in wild-type (WT) C57BL\/6 mice using a P1 phage artificial chromosome clone containing the complete human CYP2D locus, including the CYP2D6 gene and 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences. 3. Human CYP2D6 was expressed not only in the liver but also in the brain. The abundance of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in brain of Tg-2D6 is higher than in WT mice, either basal levels or after harmaline induction. Metabolomics of brain homogenate and cerebrospinal fluid revealed a significant up-regulation of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, pantothenic acid, 2'-deoxycytidine diphosphate (dCDP), anandamide, N-acetylglucosaminylamine and a down-regulation of stearoyl-L-carnitine in Tg-2D6 mice compared with WT mice. Anxiety tests indicate Tg-2D6 mice have a higher capability to adapt to anxiety. 4. Overall, these findings indicate that the Tg-2D6 mouse model may serve as a valuable in vivo tool to determine CYP2D6-involved neurophysiological metabolism and function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53c3cf058f610004732","authors":["Jie Cheng","Cheng J","Zhen Y","Miksys S","Beyo\u011flu D","Krausz KW","Tyndale RF","Yu A","Idle JR","Gonzalez FJ"],"doi":"10.3109\/00498254.2013.791410","endpage":"984","first_seen_on":"2013-07-24T22:18:43+00:00","funders":["cihr","nci"],"issns":["0049-8254","1366-5928"],"issue":"11","journal":"Xenobiotica","last_mentioned_on":1368057600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3109\/00498254.2013.791410"],"pmid":"23614566","pubdate":"2013-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"973","title":"Potential role of CYP2D6 in the central nervous system","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-role-cyp2d6-central-nervous-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627218,"mean":4.9497513377373,"rank":2018498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627218,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85565,"mean":7.4235046982376,"rank":44698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":22835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85565,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":382,"mean":1.2248503937008,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":382,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
