The ongoing VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial trial of vitamin D (in the form of vitamin D(3) [cholecalciferol], 2000 IU\/day) and marine omega-3 fatty acid (Omacor fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]+docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], 1g\/day) supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and CVD among a multi-ethnic population of 20,000 U.S. men aged \u2265 50 and women aged \u2265 55. The mean treatment period will be 5 years. Baseline blood samples will be collected in at least 16,000 participants, with follow-up blood collection in about 6000 participants. Yearly follow-up questionnaires will assess treatment compliance (plasma biomarker measures will also assess compliance in a random sample of participants), use of non-study drugs or supplements, occurrence of endpoints, and cancer and vascular risk factors. Self-reported endpoints will be confirmed by medical record review by physicians blinded to treatment assignment, and deaths will be ascertained through national registries and other sources. Ancillary studies will investigate whether these agents affect risk for diabetes and glucose intolerance; hypertension; cognitive decline; depression; osteoporosis and fracture; physical disability and falls; asthma and other respiratory diseases; infections; and rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroid diseases, and other autoimmune disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002612","authors":["Manson JE","Bassuk SS","Lee IM","Cook NR","Albert MA","Gordon D","Zaharris E","Macfadyen JG","Danielson E","Lin J","Zhang SM","Buring JE"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cct.2011.09.009","endpage":"171","first_seen_on":"2013-07-23T03:39:05+00:00","funders":["nci","niams","nhlbi"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1551-7144","15517144"],"issue":"1","journal":"Contemporary Clinical Trials","last_mentioned_on":1429192758,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21986389","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/21986389\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3253961\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cct.2011.09.009","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3253961"],"pmid":"21986389","pubdate":"2011-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"159","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL): Rationale and Design of a Large Randomized Controlled Trial of Vitamin D and Marine Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplements for the Primary Prevention of Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-omega3-trial-vital-rationale-design-large-randomized-controlled-trial-vitamin-d-marine-ome-12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":397070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4631994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95032,"mean":7.6848377266367,"rank":9766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":85171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95032,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":387,"mean":2.8998497409326,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":387,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.1416666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
