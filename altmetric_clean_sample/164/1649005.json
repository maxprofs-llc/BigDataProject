In this paper, with the dairy herd health veterinarian in mind, we review the principles of the assay and the recent literature on the potential role of bulk milk ELISA for the diagnosis of ostertagiosis, fasciolosis, parasitic bronchitis due to cattle lung worm and neosporosis. It is generally accepted that assay results reflect exposure to the parasite rather than the presence of active infection. Bulk milk ELISA can be a useful tool for the veterinary practitioner as a component of a herd health monitoring programme or in the context of a herd health investigation. It can also play a role in regional or national surveillance programmes. However, the results need to be interpreted within the context of the herd-specific health management, the milk production pattern and the parasite life cycle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000840","authors":["Sekiya M","Zintl A","Doherty M","Sekiya, Mary","Mary Sekiya","Annetta Zintl","Michael L Doherty"],"doi":"10.1186\/2046-0481-66-14","first_seen_on":"2013-07-25T14:58:12+00:00","handle":"10197\/8084","handles":["10197\/8084"],"issns":["2046-0481","0368-0762"],"issue":"1","journal":"Irish Veterinary Journal","last_mentioned_on":1476969510,"links":["http:\/\/www.irishvetjournal.org\/content\/66\/1\/14\/abstract","http:\/\/researchrepository.ucd.ie\/handle\/10197\/8084"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.irishvetjournal.org\/content\/pdf\/2046-0481-66-14.pdf","pmid":"23883526","pubdate":"2013-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"14","title":"Bulk milk ELISA and the diagnosis of parasite infections in dairy herds: a review","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/irishvetjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/2046-0481-66-14","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bulk-milk-elisa-diagnosis-parasite-infections-dairy-herds-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":5459058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1839158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125118,"mean":6.837467058833,"rank":73771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":44755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125118,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":1.8580769230769,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.8125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
