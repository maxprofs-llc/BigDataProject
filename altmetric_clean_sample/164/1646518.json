Current imaging techniques often detect only a single biochemical process, but, within whole organisms, multiple types of biochemical events contribute to physiological and pathological phenotypes. In this report, we present a general strategy for dual-analyte detection in living animals that employs in situ formation of firefly luciferin from two complementary caged precursors that can be unmasked by different biochemical processes. To establish this approach, we have developed Peroxy Caged Luciferin-2 (PCL-2), a H(2)O(2)-responsive boronic acid probe that releases 6-hydroxy-2-cyanobenzothiazole (HCBT) upon reacting with this reactive oxygen species, as well as a peptide-based probe, z-Ile-Glu-ThrAsp-D-Cys (IETDC), which releases D-cysteine in the presence of active caspase 8. Once released, HCBT and D-cysteine form firefly luciferin in situ, giving rise to a bioluminescent signal if and only if both chemical triggers proceed. This system thus constitutes an AND-type molecular logic gate that reports on the simultaneous presence of H(2)O(2) and caspase 8 activity. Using these probes, chemoselective imaging of either H(2)O(2) or caspase 8 activity was performed in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, concomitant use of PCL-2 and IETDC in vivo establishes a concurrent increase in both H(2)O(2) and caspase 8 activity during acute inflammation in living mice. Taken together, this method offers a potentially powerful new chemical tool for studying simultaneous oxidative stress and inflammation processes in living animals during injury, aging, and disease, as well as a versatile approach for concurrent monitoring of multiple analytes using luciferin-based bioluminescence imaging technologies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Genevieve C.
