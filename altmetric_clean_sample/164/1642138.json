This has increased the need for a better understanding of the complexities surrounding the role of RDTs in appropriate treatment of fever. Studies have focused on clinician practices, but few have sought to understand patient perspectives, beyond notions of acceptability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","authors":["Evelyn K Ansah","Joanna Reynolds","Samson Akanpigbiam","Christopher JM Whitty","Clare IR Chandler"],"doi":"10.1186\/1475-2875-12-258","first_seen_on":"2013-07-23T11:39:06+00:00","issns":["1475-2875",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Malaria Journal","last_mentioned_on":1374671253,"links":["http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/12\/1\/258\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1475-2875-12-258.pdf","pmid":"23876112","pubdate":"2013-07-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"258","title":"\u201cEven if the test result is negative, they should be able to tell us what is wrong with us\u201d : a qualitative study of patient expectations of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/even-test-result-negative-able-tell-wrong-qualitative-study-patient-expectations-rapid-diagnostic-te"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6286594,"mean":5.805914203449,"rank":2194683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4056826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6286594,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98879,"mean":7.7343729444366,"rank":33141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":64912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98879,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2222,"mean":4.3907672219721,"rank":939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2222,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":3.7985230769231,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
