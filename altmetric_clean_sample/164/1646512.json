Here, we show that AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR17 (ARF17) is essential for primexine formation and pollen development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The arf17 mutant exhibited a male-sterile phenotype with normal vegetative growth. ARF17 was expressed in microsporocytes and microgametophytes from meiosis to the bicellular microspore stage. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that primexine was absent in the arf17 mutant, which leads to pollen wall-patterning defects and pollen degradation. Callose deposition was also significantly reduced in the arf17 mutant, and the expression of CALLOSE SYNTHASE5 (CalS5), the major gene for callose biosynthesis, was approximately 10% that of the wild type. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that ARF17 can directly bind to the CalS5 promoter. As indicated by the expression of DR5-driven green fluorescent protein, which is an synthetic auxin response reporter, auxin signaling appeared to be specifically impaired in arf17 anthers. Taken together, our results suggest that ARF17 is essential for pollen wall patterning in Arabidopsis by modulating primexine formation at least partially through direct regulation of CalS5 gene expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Jun Yang","Lei Tian","Ming-Xi Sun","Xue-Yong Huang","Jun Zhu","Yue-Feng Guan","Qi-Shi Jia","Zhong-Nan Yang"],"doi":"10.1104\/pp.113.214940","first_seen_on":"2013-07-24T22:54:29+00:00","issns":["0032-0889","1532-2548"],"journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1372204800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1104\/pp.113.214940"],"pmid":"23580594","pubdate":"2013-04-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR17 Is Essential for Pollen Wall Pattern Formation in Arabidopsis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/auxin-response-factor17-essential-pollen-wall-pattern-formation-arabidopsis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":2018826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":930675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85547,"mean":7.4380467117107,"rank":44715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":22789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85547,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2097,"mean":2.561447519084,"rank":1068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2097,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.0716,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
