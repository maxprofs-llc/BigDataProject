Examples include the Medical College Admission Test, Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test and the UK Clinical Aptitude Test. The most widely used measure of their efficacy is predictive validity.A new tool, the Health Professions Admission Test- Ireland (HPAT-Ireland), was introduced in 2009. Traditionally, selection to Irish undergraduate medical schools relied on academic achievement. Since 2009, Irish and EU applicants are selected on a combination of their secondary school academic record (measured predominately by the Leaving Certificate Examination) and HPAT-Ireland score. This is the first study to report on the predictive validity of the HPAT-Ireland for early undergraduate assessments of communication and clinical skills.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bf","authors":["Kelly ME","Regan D","Dunne F","Henn P","Newell J","O Flynn S"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6920-13-68","first_seen_on":"2013-05-21T09:35:38+00:00","issns":["1472-6920"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Education","last_mentioned_on":1441243703,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/13\/68\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23663266"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6920-13-68.pdf","pmid":"23663266","pubdate":"2013-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"68","subjects":["education"],"title":"To what extent does the Health Professions Admission Test-Ireland predict performance in early undergraduate tests of communication and clinical skills? -- An observational cohort study.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extent-health-professions-admission-testireland-predict-performance-early-undergraduate-tests-commun"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5950429,"mean":6.0710658100511,"rank":1194906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":4751218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5950429,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97827,"mean":7.34532852207,"rank":22527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":75114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97827,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1019,"mean":4.6227779960707,"rank":320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1019,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":3.2175675675676,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
