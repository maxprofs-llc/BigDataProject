The effect of histamine is largely determined locally by the histamine receptor expression pattern. Histamine receptor H4 (HRH4), the newest member of the histamine receptor family, is positively expressed on the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, and its function remains to be elucidated. Previously, we reported the decreased expression of HRH4 in colorectal cancers and revealed its correlation with tumor proliferation. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the abnormalities of HRH4 gene in gastric carcinomas (GCs).","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E1207Z","altmetric_jid":"ads","authors":["Chao Zhang","Yi Xiong","Jiana Li","Yang Yang","Li Liu","Wen Wang","Luo Wang","Manhui Li","Zhengyu Fang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0031207","first_seen_on":"2013-05-20T08:35:19+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"2","journal":"Astrophysics Data System (ADS)","last_mentioned_on":1369033880,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3282702\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3282702","pmid":"22363581","pubdate":"2013-05-20T20:12:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Deletion and Down-Regulation of HRH4 Gene in Gastric Carcinomas: A Potential Correlation with Tumor Progression","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deletion-downregulation-hrh4-gene-gastric-carcinomas-potential-correlation-tumor-progression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628563,"mean":4.9406420973419,"rank":2903141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628563,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85860,"mean":6.92783186387,"rank":67620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85860,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64070,"mean":8.2959624779536,"rank":50289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64070,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3936,"mean":8.6162952986023,"rank":3069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3936,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
