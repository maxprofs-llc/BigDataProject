With a minimum follow-up of 10 years, mean age at time of surgery was 38.9 years (range, 15-50 years). Survivorship was 100%. There was no radiographic evidence of osteolysis or component loosening. Mean steady-state femoral head penetration rate was 0.020 \u00b1 0.0047 mm\/yr. Clinical outcomes were excellent, with mean Harris hip score of 91.2 (range, 72-99) points at final follow-up.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Babovic N","Trousdale RT","Nikola Babovic","Robert T.
