The entity of HCCC should be considered in patients presenting with well-circumscribed longstanding nodular enlargement without any other significant abnormality. HCCC is often difficult to diagnose due to its unusual presentation. This report presents a male patient who reported with a complaint of 2 month history of a large swelling on the tongue. The clinical, radiological, histological and immunohistochemical findings, confirmed the diagnosis of HCCC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Jay Gopal Ray","Sourav Bhattacharya","Basudev Mahato","Sanjit Mukherjee","Keya Chaudhuri"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr.09.2011.4846","first_seen_on":"2013-05-19T12:13:10+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1341512438,"links":["http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2011\/bcr.09.2011.4846.abstract?sid=e27cffe0-81c9-4a7a-acb2-7093f1fe7469"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2011\/bcr.09.2011.4846.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3233921","pmid":"22669767","pubdate":"2011-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"A large swelling of the tongue","type":"article","volume":"2011","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/large-swelling-tongue"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":2899443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85635,"mean":6.9407843847072,"rank":67386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85635,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1686,"mean":2.6978172106825,"rank":1154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1686,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":4.0492475247525,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"A large swelling of the tongue -- Ray et al. 2011 -- BMJ Case Reports","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=459133264105864&id=268916429865794","license":"public","citation_ids":[1491687],"posted_on":"2012-07-05T18:20:38+00:00","summary":"A large swelling of the tongue\nBy Dr. Jay Gopal Ray, Dr.Sourav Bhattacharya, Dr. Basudev Mahato, Dr.Sanjit Mukherjee, Dr.Keya Chaudhuri\nhttp:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2011\/bcr.09.2011.4846.abstract?sid=e27cffe0-81c9-4a7a-acb2-7093f1fe7469","author":{"name":"Dr. R.
