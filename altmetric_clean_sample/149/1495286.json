Both fragments are cyclometalated to the same central phenyl ring in the para- or meta-position. All complexes have been fully characterized by standard techniques, two of them additionally by solid-state structures. Photoluminescence properties were investigated and very high quantum yields of 76-93% at room temperature have been observed. For a single-matrix device with an emitter concentration of 30%, a current efficiency of 25 cd A(-1), an external quantum efficiency of 8.5%, and a luminance efficiency of 10 lm W(-1) were achieved at 300 cd m(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to support experimental data and gain further insight into the photoluminescence behaviour.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Alexander Tronnier","Thomas Strassner"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3dt50841b","first_seen_on":"2013-05-21T09:33:13+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"27","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1369128542,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/C3DT50841B"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/dt\/c3dt50841b","pmid":"23689316","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"9847","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"(C^C*) Cyclometalated binuclear N-heterocyclic biscarbene platinum(II) complexes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 highly emissive phosphorescent emitters","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cc-cyclometalated-binuclear-nheterocyclic-biscarbene-platinumii-complexes-highly-emissive-phosphores"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3555950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89886,"mean":7.1626438449131,"rank":72136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89886,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":0.95300375751503,"rank":4578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
