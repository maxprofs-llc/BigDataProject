ATLS(\u00ae) classification and recommendations on hemorrhagic shock are not helpful because antiphysiological and potentially misleading. Hemorrhagic shock needs to be reclassified in the direction of usefulness and timing of intervention: in particular its assessment and management need to be tailored to physiology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fcf","authors":["Bonanno","Fabrizio Giuseppe Bonanno"],"doi":"10.4103\/0974-2700.102357","first_seen_on":"2013-05-22T08:29:42+00:00","issns":["0974-2700"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Emergencies, Trauma & Shock","last_mentioned_on":1455569516,"links":["http:\/\/www.onlinejets.org\/article.asp?issn=0974-2700;year=2012;volume=5;issue=4;spage=285;epage=295;aulast=Bonanno","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3519039\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.onlinejets.org\/article.asp?issn=0974-2700;year=2012;volume=5;issue=4;spage=285;epage=295;aulast=Bonanno;type=2","pmcid":"PMC3519039","pmid":"23248495","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Hemorrhagic shock: The \"physiology approach\"","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hemorrhagic-shock-physiology-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7196678,"mean":6.3286026753702,"rank":3422014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":3589357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7196678,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118568,"mean":6.7108506076734,"rank":51525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":63348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118568,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190,"mean":3.6752275132275,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":4.1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
