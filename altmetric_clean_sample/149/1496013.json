The pH-sensitive polymersome-like vesicle structure includes two layers that can encapsulate either hydrophobic or hydrophilic therapeutic drugs at physiological pH 7.4. Below a pH of 7.0, the polymersome membrane forms tunnels through which the drug cargo can be rapidly released. The size and morphology of the polymersome are measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The pH sensitivity is confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The pH-sensitive drug-delivery polymersome provides a simple and powerful smart carrier for the delivery and controlled release of drugs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008093","authors":["Jeong, In Ki","Gao, Guang Hui","Li, Yi","Kang, Seong Woo","Lee, Doo Sung"],"doi":"10.1002\/mabi.201200468","endpage":"953","first_seen_on":"2013-05-21T14:06:51+00:00","issns":["1616-5195","1616-5187"],"issue":"7","journal":"Macromolecular Bioscience","last_mentioned_on":1369144934,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201200468\/abstract;jsessionid=C40E01AF6396F745A32B247F88677F73.d04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fmabi.201200468&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201200468\/pdf","pmid":"23696500","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"946","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"A Biodegradable Polymersome with pH\u00e2\u0080\u0090Tuning On\u00e2\u0080\u0090Off Membrane Based on Poly(\u00e2\u0080\u0090amino ester) for Drug Delivery","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biodegradable-polymersome-phtuning-onoff-membrane-based-poly%CE%B2amino-ester-drug-delivery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":2739735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":736165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85816,"mean":6.9296199032805,"rank":62452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85816,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":689,"mean":1.1642151162791,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":689,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
