Find out: #JACCINT"],"citation":{"abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and clinical results following a pre-specified bioresorbable scaffold (Absorb BVS) implantation strategy in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\nConcerns were raised about the safety of Absorb because a non-negligible rate of thrombosis was reported within 30 days and at midterm follow-up after primary percutaneous coronary intervention.\nThis was a prospective, multicenter study of patients with STEMI (<75 years of age with symptom onset <12\u00a0h) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention with Absorb following a dedicated implantation protocol. The primary endpoint was a device-oriented composite endpoint of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization within 30 days.\nDuring the study period, 505 patients with STEMI (16.9% of the overall STEMI population) were treated with the Absorb BVS. The mean age was 56.6 \u00b1 9.4 years, and 487 patients (96.4%) were in Killip class I or II at admission. According to the study protocol, direct Absorb implantation was feasible in 47 patients (9.3%), whereas post-dilatation was\u00a0performed in 468 cases (92.7%). Procedural success was attained in 94.8% of the cases. Dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor or prasugrel was administered at discharge in 481 patients (95.1%). At 30-day follow-up, the hierarchical device-oriented composite endpoint rate was 0.6% (0.4% cardiac death, 0.2% target vessel myocardial infarction and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization). One episode (0.2%) of probable scaffold thrombosis was reported.\nA pre-specified Absorb implantation strategy in real-world patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention was feasible and associated with a low 30-day device-oriented composite endpoint rate. Mid- and long-term follow-up is strongly needed to eventually confirm these early results.
