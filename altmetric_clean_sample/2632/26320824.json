Factors influencing this illegal market are high profit margins, a\u00a0low risk of detection, low control density, an obscure legal situation, and lastly, the easy and anonymous ways of selling over the Internet, usually across national borders. This situation was the background for the research project on the impact of European e\u2011commerce liberalisation on pharmaceutical crime (ALPhA). The goal of the project was to develop concrete recommendations for action regarding the improved prosecution of internet-based pharmaceutical crime and to create a\u00a0broad body of data for effective law-making by legislators.In this article the initial situation regarding pharmaceutical crime and its risk potential is described and some of the results from the comparative-law investigation of the ALPhA research project are presented along with its final recommendations. The latter are directed at policy-makers and law enforcement agencies in addition to industry and science and demonstrate the type of framework to be designed to increase safety for the public and to minimize risks when purchasing pharmaceuticals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006d73","authors":["Sinn, Arndt"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00103-017-2627-5","first_seen_on":"2017-09-19T17:25:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1436-9990","1437-1588"],"journal":"Bundesgesundheitsblatt - Gesundheitsforschung - Gesundheitsschutz","last_mentioned_on":1505841910,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/epdf\/10.1007\/s00103-017-2627-5?author_access_token=JrJZ34zqqQhnhWwARZHQ7_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY66lCrPE809Toi89VeC4-9blwhwUCEvA07y1O9nVIhSdKvUwoNAA-oHEEhZt1VKt5wxh6F_5myD2FEbb3FQ0sqwnMzw_xTRavgPEHmICu6FxA%3D%3D"],"pmid":"28929171","pubdate":"2017-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Auswirkungen der Liberalisierung des Internethandels in Europa auf den Ph\u00e4nomenbereich der Arzneimittelkriminalit\u00e4t","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8436356,"mean":7.0937825748122,"rank":4506240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2350294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8436356,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111878,"mean":11.789640676815,"rank":60241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":39927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111878,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297,"mean":2.6514054054054,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.2571428571429,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ArndtSinn\/statuses\/910193057135562752","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26320824],"posted_on":"2017-09-19T17:25:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Prof. Dr. Arndt Sinn","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731780265614409728\/dYDMaKh0_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ArndtSinn","tweeter_id":"731779390477045760","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":28},"tweet_id":"910193057135562752"}]}}
