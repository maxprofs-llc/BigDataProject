Individual anthocyanin levels and compositional profiles vary with cultivar, maturity, season, region and yield and have been proposed as chemical markers to differentiate wines and to provide valuable information regarding the adulteration of musts and wines. A fast, easy, solvent-free, non-destructive method based on visible, short wave and near infrared hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in intact grape berries to fingerprinting the color pigments in eight different grape varieties was developed and tested against HPLC. Predictive models based on modified partial least squares (MPLS) were built for 14 individual anthocyanins with coefficients of determination of cross validation (R2cv) ranging from 0.70 to 0.93. For the grouping of total and non-acylated anthocyanins, external validation was conducted with coefficient of determination of prediction (R2P) of 0.86. HSI could potentially become an alternative to HPLC with reduced analysis time and labour costs, while providing reliable and robust information of the anthocyanin composition of grape berries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Maria P.
