In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effects of HSYA and the underlying mechanisms were investigated in interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2-induced SW982 human synovial cells. The cells were pretreated with HSYA at various concentrations (2.5, 10 and 40 \u03bcM) followed by IL-1\u03b2 (10 ng mL(-1)) stimulation. HSYA significantly inhibited the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated SW982 cells. HSYA also inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p65 and c-Jun. It also suppressed the degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and blocked p65 translocation into the nucleus. These results indicate that the inhibitory effects of HSYA on IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-1 release might be mediated via suppression of ERK, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling pathways. The present data support the potential role of HSYA as an effective therapeutic agent in osteoarthritis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007461","authors":["Bin-Feng Cheng","Yao-Xin Gao","Jun-Jiang Lian","Dan-dan Guo","Lei Wang","Mian Wang","Hai-Jie Yang","Zhi-Wei Feng","Dan-Dan Guo"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6fo01045h","first_seen_on":"2016-09-23T14:30:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2042-650X"],"journal":"Food & Function","last_mentioned_on":1474641020,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/FO\/C6FO01045H?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2FFO+%28RSC+-+Food+%26+Function+latest+articles+%29"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/fo\/c6fo01045h","pmid":"27713966","pubdate":"2016-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["physiology","chemistry","nutritionalsciences","biochemistry"],"title":"Hydroxysafflor yellow A inhibits IL-1\u03b2-induced release of IL-6, IL-8, and MMP-1 via suppression of ERK, NF-\u03baB and AP-1 signaling in SW982 human synovial cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydroxysafflor-yellow-inhibits-il1%CE%B2induced-release-il6-il8-mmp1-via-suppression-erk-nf%CE%BAb-ap1-signali"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":7278547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253833,"mean":12.674747691386,"rank":209198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253833,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1499,"mean":4.4252510013351,"rank":1198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1499,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":1.4545454545455,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cheminfochem\/statuses\/779327042206756865","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12164182],"posted_on":"2016-09-23T14:30:20+00:00","author":{"name":"cheminfochem","url":"http:\/\/www.infochem.co.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/595534993138429952\/ULVzIDHv_normal.jpg","description":"We want people to understand the technicalities behind the beauty of physics, the mystery of chemistry and the loveliness of science as a whole.","id_on_source":"cheminfochem","tweeter_id":"3235595698","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6},"tweet_id":"779327042206756865"}]}}
