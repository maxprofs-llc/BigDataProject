Experimentally resolving proton positions and structural details is challenging, and conventional molecular dynamics simulations are performed with preassigned and fixed protonation states. To address this challenge, here we illustrate the use of the state-of-the-art continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) to directly describe the activation of the M2 channel of influenza virus, for which abundant experimental data are available. Starting from the closed crystal structure, simulation reveals a pH-dependent conformational switch to an activated state which resembles the open crystal structure. Importantly, simulation affords the free energy of channel opening coupled to the titration of a histidine tetrad, thereby providing a thermodynamic mechanism for M2 activation, which is consistent with NMR data and resolves the controversy with crystal structures obtained at different pH. This work illustrates the utility of CpHMD in offering previously unattainable conformational details and thermodynamic information for proton-coupled transmembrane channels and transporters.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dea","authors":["Wei Chen"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpclett.6b01853","endpage":"3966","first_seen_on":"2016-09-23T19:17:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1948-7185"],"journal":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1474658210,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpclett.6b01853"],"pmid":"27648806","pubdate":"2016-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"3961","title":"Conformational Activation of a Transmembrane Proton Channel from Constant pH Molecular Dynamics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conformational-activation-transmembrane-proton-channel-constant-ph-molecular-dynamics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":7278499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253833,"mean":12.67459818305,"rank":209173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253833,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2549,"mean":3.2912386185243,"rank":1561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2549,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":4.301775,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
