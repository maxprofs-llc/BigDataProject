Participants were children aged 8 to 17 years who sustained a concussion in the previous 24 hours and visited a single emergency department. The outcome of interest was an increase from pre-concussion baseline of at least 3 symptoms from the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory, measured at one week and at one month following concussion. The primary outcome was to determine the proportion of children who completed the assessment at one week following the intervention. Secondary outcome was the proportion of children who completed the assessment at one month following the intervention. All children, care givers, and those assessing the outcomes were blinded to the group assignment.\nOf the 218 children presenting with a concussion during the study period, we screened 108 and found 36\/108 (33%) eligible to participate and 16\/108 (14.8%) agreed to participate. All enrolled patients were compliant with the intervention and follow-up.\nIn our study population, approximately one-third of the screened concussion patients were eligible to participate and approximately one half of those eligible agreed to participate. Our study found that most enrolled patients preferred electronic follow-up; the noncompliance rate was minimal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002534","authors":["Gravel, Jocelyn","Carri\u00e8re, Benoit","D'Angelo, Antonio","Crevier, Louis","Beauchamp, Miriam H","M\u00e2sse, Beno\u00eet","Jocelyn Gravel","Benoit Carri\u00e8re","Antonio D\u2019Angelo","Louis Crevier","Miriam H.
