Although verbal and symbolic (e.g., a car horn) warnings have faster response times than abstract warnings, they often lead to more response errors.\nParticipants (N=20) experienced four nonlooming auditory warnings (constant intensity, pulsed, ramped, and car horn), three looming auditory warnings (\"veridical,\" \"early,\" and \"late\"), and a no-warning condition. In 80% of the trials, warnings were activated when a critical response was required, and in 20% of the trials, the warnings were false alarms. For the early (late) looming warnings, the rate of change of intensity signaled a time to collision (TTC) that was shorter (longer) than the actual TTC.\nVeridical looming and car horn warnings had significantly faster brake reaction times (BRT) compared with the other nonlooming warnings (by 80 to 160 ms). However, the number of braking responses in false alarm conditions was significantly greater for the car horn. BRT increased significantly and systematically as the TTC signaled by the looming warning was changed from early to veridical to late.\nLooming auditory warnings produce the best combination of response speed and accuracy.\nThe results indicate that looming auditory warnings can be used to effectively warn a driver about an impending collision.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4dd3cf058f610001c0b","authors":["Rob Gray"],"doi":"10.1177\/0018720810397833","endpage":"74","first_seen_on":"2016-09-23T12:27:47+00:00","issns":["0018-7208","1547-8181"],"issue":"1","journal":"Human Factors","last_mentioned_on":1474597335,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/0018720810397833"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hfs.sagepub.com\/content\/53\/1\/63.full.pdf","pmid":"21469534","pubdate":"2011-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"63","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Looming Auditory Collision Warnings for Driving","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/looming-auditory-collision-warnings-driving"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":4498685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2345420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253834,"mean":12.675054488581,"rank":140167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253834,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":796,"mean":6.6659622641509,"rank":519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":796,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":31.830434782609,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
