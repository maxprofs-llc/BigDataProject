The aim of this review is to examine published clinical evidence that has directly compared two recommended treatment approaches in patients with T2D: (1) a 'basal plus' regimen, whereby 1-2 injections of prandial insulin are added to basal insulin; or (2) the use of once- or twice-daily premix insulin analogs, which contain both basal and prandial insulin in a single injection. Broadly, the available evidence suggests that both basal plus and premix regimens are comparable in terms of efficacy and safety when used for insulin initiation in insulin-na\u00efve patients and intensification in patients who have failed on basal insulin; instances of greater glycemic control are observed with premix insulin; however, these are often accompanied by increases in hypoglycemia and\/or weight relative to basal plus treatment, and results should be interpreted within the context of total insulin doses used. Relatively low numbers of patients achieved glycemic control when both regimens were used for insulin intensification following failure of basal insulin, suggesting that a full basal-bolus regimen and\/or the use of different treatments is clinically indicated in certain patients. In summary, the current review argues that both basal plus and premix insulin regimens are relatively efficacious and safe options for patients with T2D during both insulin initiation in insulin-na\u00efve patients and intensification in patients who have failed on basal insulin. This emphasizes the important role of patient-centered factors in clinical decision-making.\nNovo Nordisk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007100","authors":["Michelle Downie","Gary Kilov","Jencia Wong"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13300-016-0199-2","first_seen_on":"2016-09-23T14:10:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1869-6961","1869-6953"],"journal":"Diabetes Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1474643163,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs13300-016-0199-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs13300-016-0199-2.pdf","pmid":"27658921","pubdate":"2016-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Healthcare","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Diabetes","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Initiation and Intensification Strategies in Type 2 Diabetes Management: A Comparison of Basal Plus and Premix Regimens","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/initiation-intensification-strategies-type-2-diabetes-management-comparison-basal-plus-premix-regime"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":6089378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2031529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253833,"mean":12.674729569163,"rank":164570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":75546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253833,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":4.5326666666667,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.5617647058824,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Psychology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AdisRapidPlus\/statuses\/779321995725041664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12163850],"posted_on":"2016-09-23T14:10:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Adis Rapid Plus","url":"http:\/\/www.adis-rapidplus.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000828104383\/1851d9040acc3d77fefe900d7c8028bb_normal.png","description":"The latest research, reviews and news from the Adis Rapid+ portfolio - #openaccess, rapid publication #healthcare journals.
