Health care crises and developmental milestones are potent triggers for resurgence of chronic sorrow. Helpful strategies by healthcare providers include providing information, helping to procure respite and being empathetic and compassionate.\nHealthcare providers need to understand that chronic sorrow is a normal consequence of having a child with a chronic illness or disability.\nFamily-centered interventions should be individualized and aimed at providing increased comfort to parents in times of need. Further research that looks at the effectiveness of interventions is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a86","authors":["Coughlin, Mary Beth","Sethares, Kristen A.","Mary Beth Coughlin","Kristen A.
