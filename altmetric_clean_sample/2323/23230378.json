Therefore, selective inhibition of self-peptide loading onto such disease-associated HLA could ameliorate the diseases. To effectively identify such compounds, in this study, we established, for the first time, a cell- and 96-well microplate-based high-throughput screening system for inhibitors of antigen presentation. A panel of DRB1 genes plus DRA*01:01 gene were expressed in HEK293T cells and in 3T3 cells, and their binding with biotinylated known self-antigen peptides was measured by flow cytometry. HLA-DR1 (DRB1*01:01) and DR15 (DRB1*15:01) showed a high affinity with myelin basic protein peptide (MBP83-98). Therefore, in 96-well plate wells, MBP83-99 was allowed to bind to DR1 or DR15 on 3T3 cells in competition with a test compound, and the HLA-bound peptide was detected by streptavidin-conjugated \u03b2-galactosidase, thereby identifying inhibitor compounds for rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. Our assay system has a potential for broad applications, including designing peptide vaccines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Watanabe, Nobuo","Suzuki, Yusuke","Yonezu, Takahisa","Nakagawa, Yuki","Shiina, Takashi","Hirayama, Noriaki","Inokuchi, Sadaki","Inoue, Shigeaki","Nobuo Watanabe","Yusuke Suzuki","Takahisa Yonezu","Yuki Nakagawa","Takashi Shiina","Noriaki Hirayama","Sadaki Inokuchi","Shigeaki Inoue"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-07080-4","first_seen_on":"2017-07-30T10:59:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1502200818,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28754892?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-07080-4","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28754892?dopt=Abstractu0026utm_source=dlvr.itu0026utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-07080-4.pdf","pmid":"28754892","pubdate":"2017-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","startpage":"6798","subjects":["science"],"title":"A cell-based high-throughput screening assay system for inhibitor compounds of antigen presentation by HLA class II molecule","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cellbased-highthroughput-screening-assay-system-inhibitor-compounds-antigen-presentation-hla-class-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":6032764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2011817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194966,"mean":12.359060990434,"rank":126732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":56619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194966,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36631,"mean":14.716910674311,"rank":24618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":10159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36631,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3840,"mean":12.473734826778,"rank":2438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3840,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
