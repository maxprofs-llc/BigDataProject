Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for adhesion\/growth-regulatory galectins, three pro-inflammatory chemo- and cytokines and keratins.\nUp- and down-regulation was found for 281 (tumor vs. normal) and 276 genes (transition zone vs. normal), respectively. The profile of the transition zone had its own features, with similarity to the tumor. Galectins were affected in a network manner, with differential regulation and interindividual variability between patients, also true for keratins and the chemo- and cytokines.\nThese results underline special features at each site of specimen origin as well as the importance of analyzing galectins as a network and of defining the expression status of the individual patient prior to reaching clinically relevant conclusions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["VERONIKA ZIVICOVA","PETR BROZ","ZDENEK FIK","ALZBETA MIFKOVA","JAN PLZAK","ZDENEK CADA","HERBERT KALTNER","JANA FIALOVA KUCEROVA","HANS-JOACHIM GABIUS","KAREL SMETANA JR"],"doi":"10.21873\/anticanres.11565","first_seen_on":"2017-08-11T10:21:48+00:00","issns":["02507005","17917530"],"issue":"5","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1502446894,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28476793?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28476793","pubdate":"2017-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Genome-wide Expression Profiling (with Focus on the Galectin Network) in Tumor, Transition Zone and Normal Tissue of Head and Neck Cancer: Marked Differences Between Individual Patients and the Site of Specimen Origin","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-expression-profiling-focus-galectin-network-tumor-transition-zone-normal-tissue-head-neck"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":7222511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178808,"mean":12.460539844637,"rank":146032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178808,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1792,"mean":3.4846018983808,"rank":1167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1792,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":2.3245614035088,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
