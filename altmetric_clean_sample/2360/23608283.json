In the current work we have compared the function and gene expression profile of BM-MSC from healthy donors (HD-MSC) and patients with MPN (JAK2V617F), showing no differences in the morphology, proliferation and differentiation capacity between both groups. However, BM-MSC from MPN expressed higher mean fluorescence intensity (MIF) of CD73, CD44 and CD90, whereas CD105 was lower when compared to controls. Gene expression profile of BM-MSC showed a total of 169 genes that were differentially expressed in BM-MSC from MPN patients compared to HD-MSC. In addition, we studied the ability of BM-MSC to support the growth and survival of hematopoietic stem\/progenitor cells (HSPC), showing a significant increase in the number of CFU-GM colonies when MPN-HSPC were co-cultured with MPN-MSC. Furthermore, MPN-MSC showed alteration in the expression of genes associated to the maintenance of hematopoiesis, with an overexpression of SPP1 and NF-kB, and a downregulation of ANGPT1 and THPO. Our results suggest that BM-MSC from JAK2+ patients differ from their normal counterparts and favor the maintenance of malignant clonal hematopoietic cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ramos, Teresa L.","S\u00e1nchez-Abarca, Luis Ignacio","Ros\u00f3n-Burgo, Beatriz","Redondo, Alba","Rico, Ana","Preciado, Silvia","Ortega, Rebeca","Rodr\u00edguez, Concepci\u00f3n","Munti\u00f3n, Sandra","Hern\u00e1ndez-Hern\u00e1ndez, \u00c1ngel","De Las Rivas, Javier","Gonz\u00e1lez, Marcos","Gonz\u00e1lez Porras, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n","del Ca\u00f1izo, Consuelo","S\u00e1nchez-Guijo, Ferm\u00edn"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0182470","first_seen_on":"2017-08-11T10:25:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1502447106,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28796790?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28796790","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science (PLoS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from JAK2+ myeloproliferative neoplasms differ from normal MSC and contribute to the maintenance of neoplastic hematopoiesis","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mesenchymal-stromal-cells-msc-jak2-myeloproliferative-neoplasms-differ-normal-msc-contribute-mainten"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":7222513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178808,"mean":12.46053565017,"rank":146032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178808,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115457,"mean":10.618014932096,"rank":97299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115457,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2674,"mean":10.71691432847,"rank":2090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2674,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HSC_papers\/statuses\/895954220620300288","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23608283],"posted_on":"2017-08-11T10:25:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Hematopoiesis","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/618441198634561537\/Y2u99HYj_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"HSC_papers","tweeter_id":"3271095818","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":88},"tweet_id":"895954220620300288"}]}}
