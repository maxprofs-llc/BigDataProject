The intervention group (IG) received a motor-cognitive training on (Physiomat\u00ae) including concurrent dual-tasks of balance control with cognitive demands (Physiomat\u00ae-Trail Making Tasks (PTMTs)). The control group (CG) performed non-specific, low-intensity exercises. Duration and accuracy at different complexity levels of trained and untrained PTMTs and the number of successfully performed tasks (PTMT score) were assessed.\nPhysiomat\u00ae training significantly improved the duration and accuracy at almost all complexity levels of trained (P \u2264 0.001-0.047, \u03b7p(2) = 0.065-0.589) and untrained PTMTs (P < 0.001-0.005, \u03b7p(2) = 0.073-0.459). Significant effects were also found for the PTMT score of trained (P < 0.001, \u03b7p(2) = 0.211) and untrained PTMTs (P < 0.001, \u03b7p(2) = 0.184). Training gains were partly sustained at follow-up.\nPhysiomat\u00ae is feasible and has the potential to sustainably improve motor-cognitive performances in people with dementia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f610001785","authors":["Wiloth, Stefanie","Werner, Christian","Lemke, Nele Christin","Bauer, J\u00fcrgen","Hauer, Klaus"],"doi":"10.1080\/13607863.2017.1348472","first_seen_on":"2017-08-11T08:59:34+00:00","issns":["1360-7863","1364-6915"],"journal":"Aging &amp; Mental Health","last_mentioned_on":1502441961,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/13607863.2017.1348472"],"pmid":"28682124","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["geriatrics","psychology"],"title":"Motor-cognitive effects of a computerized game-based training method in people with dementia: a randomized controlled trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/motorcognitive-effects-computerized-gamebased-training-method-people-dementia-randomized-controlled"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":6340133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1132690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178808,"mean":12.460537887219,"rank":126180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178808,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":826,"mean":5.0150739393939,"rank":636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":826,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":7.253488372093,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
