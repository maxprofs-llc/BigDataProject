Five skeletal measurements, five dental measurements and two soft tissue measurements were managed based on 21 landmarks. The durations of the performances of the two methods were also compared.\nSNA (Sella, Nasion, A point angle) and SNB (Sella, Nasion, B point angle) values for the manual method were statistically lower (p\u2009<\u2009.001) than those for the app method. The ANB value for the manual method was statistically lower than that of app method. L1-NB (\u00b0) and upper lip protrusion values for the manual method were statistically higher than those for the app method. Go-GN\/SN, U1-NA (\u00b0) and U1-NA (mm) values for manual method were statistically lower than those for the app method. No differences between the two methods were found in the L1-NB (mm), occlusal plane to SN, interincisal angle or lower lip protrusion values.\nAlthough statistically significant differences were found between the two methods, the cephalometric tracing proceeded faster with the app method than with the manual method.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215b","authors":["Sayar, G\u00fcl\u015filay","Kilinc, Delal Dara"],"doi":"10.1080\/00016357.2017.1364420","first_seen_on":"2017-08-11T10:03:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0001-6357","1502-3850"],"journal":"Acta Odontologica Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1502445767,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28793813?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28793813","pubdate":"2017-08-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Manual tracing versus smartphone application (app) tracing: a comparative study","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":7222516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178807,"mean":12.460610091384,"rank":146036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178807,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":328,"mean":3.0378837920489,"rank":283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":328,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.33333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/doctick\/statuses\/895948604363374592","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23607190],"posted_on":"2017-08-11T10:02:47+00:00","author":{"name":"doctick","url":"http:\/\/doctick.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502911606083166208\/Mo60jRB-_normal.png","description":"Working on medical online calculators and automated notification systems for science articles & #healtcareIT trends...","id_on_source":"doctick","tweeter_id":"2295768584","geo":{"lt":41.38879,"ln":2.15899,"country":"ES"},"followers":253},"tweet_id":"895948604363374592"}]}}
