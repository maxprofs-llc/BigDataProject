This may lead to subsequent precipitation and thus the loss of the solubility advantage. Although higher supersaturation is known to result in faster precipitation, the overall effect of this faster precipitation on the bioavailability is not well understood. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of the impact of extent of supersaturation (i.e., dose) on the resulting kinetic solubility profiles of supersaturating dosage forms. Experimental concentration-time curves of two model compounds with different recrystallization tendencies, indomethacin (IND) and naproxen (NAP), were explored under varying sink indices (SIs) by infusing varying volumes of dissolved drug (e.g., in ethanol) into the dissolution medium. The experimental results were simulated with a mechanistic model considering classical nucleation theory and interface controlled growth on the nucleus surface. In the absence of dissolved polymer to inhibit precipitation, experimental and predicted results show that there exists a critical supersaturation below which no precipitation is observed, and due to this supersaturation maintenance, there exists an optimal dose which maximizes the area under the curve (AUC) of the kinetic solubility concentration-time profile. In the presence of dissolved polymer from ASD dissolution, similar trends were observed except the critical supersaturation was increased due to crystallization inhibition by the dissolved polymer. The importance of measuring the experimental \"kinetic solubility\" is emphasized. However, we show that the true solubility advantage of amorphous solids depends not on the \"kinetic solubility\" of amorphous dosage forms, typically arising from the balance between the rate of supersaturation generation and the precipitation kinetics, but rather on the critical supersaturation below which precipitation is not observed for a sufficiently long period.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c9","authors":["Yi Rang Han"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00788","first_seen_on":"2016-12-01T23:12:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1543-8384","1543-8392"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Pharmaceutics","last_mentioned_on":1480686568,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00788"],"pmid":"28043130","pubdate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Effect of Extent of Supersaturation on the Evolution of Kinetic Solubility Profiles","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-extent-supersaturation-evolution-kinetic-solubility-profiles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":3443954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4305673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251369,"mean":12.181489505426,"rank":108892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":138293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251369,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1115,"mean":5.171750448833,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1115,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.7822857142857,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
