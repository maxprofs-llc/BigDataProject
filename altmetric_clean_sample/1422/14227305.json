In male lizards, increasing levels of testosterone (T) bolster conspicuous colouration, stimulate territoriality, and trigger antagonistic interactions among rivals. Moreover, in colour polymorphic species, reproductive strategy, aggressiveness and T levels can differ between morphs. Therefore, T level is considered as an important mechanism that regulates the expression of colour polymorphism and sexual behaviours of males. But in the polymorphic territorial wall lizard (Podarcis muralis), a lack of relationship between morphs and aggressiveness challenges the notion that T plays such a role. To examine this issue, we compared adult T levels among three colour morphs (white, yellow and red) through repeated sampling during the mating season. High T levels were observed at the onset of the mating season followed by a significant decrease, a pattern documented in other lizard species. Mean T levels did not differ among morphs. However, yellow males maintained significantly higher T levels over time and displayed a stronger subsequent decline. Overall, in this species, seasonal T patterns differ among morphs, not mean values. Previous studies revealed that T suppresses the immune response; suggesting that a strong initial investment promoted by high T levels may trade-off against immunity (maintenance). Further experimental investigations are required to clarify the relationship between T and reproductive effort in polymorphic species that exhibit complex temporal pattern of T levels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002936","authors":["Sacchi, Roberto","Scali, Stefano","Mangiacotti, Marco","Sannolo, Marco","Zuffi, Marco A L","Pupin, Fabio","Gentilli, Augusto","Bonnet, Xavier","Roberto Sacchi","Stefano Scali","Marco Mangiacotti","Marco Sannolo","Marco A.L.
