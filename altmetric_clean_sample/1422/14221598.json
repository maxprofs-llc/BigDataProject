The transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is key in cellular processes, and the expression\/activation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) are crucial for cell invasion. The present study investigated the hypothesis that curcumin inhibits colon cancer cell invasion by modulating NF-\u03baB-mediated expression and activation of uPA and MMP9. Human colon cancer SW480 and LoVo cells were treated with various concentrations of curcumin. Curcumin was demonstrated to dose-dependently inhibit the adhesion and proliferation ability of LoVo and SW480 cells using Transwell and MTT assays, respectively. In addition, curcumin activated 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and suppressed p65 NF-\u03baB phosphorylation, as shown by western blot analysis. Compound C, a potent AMPK inhibitor, abolished curcumin-induced inhibition of NF-\u03baB, uPA and MMP9, suggesting that AMPK activation is responsible for curcumin-mediated NF-\u03baB, uPA and MMP9 inhibition. The binding activity of NF-\u03baB to DNA was examined and western blotting and quantitative polymerase reaction was performed to detect the effect of curcumin on the expression of uPA and MMP9. The present results revealed that curcumin significantly decreased the expression of uPA and MMP9 and NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity. Furthermore, curcumin decreased the level of the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB binding to the promoter of the gene encoding uPA and MMP9, which suppressed transcriptional activation of uPA and MMP9. Overall, the present data suggest that curcumin inhibits colon cancer cell invasion via AMPK activation and subsequent inhibition of p65 NF-\u03baB, uPA and MMP9. The therapeutic potential of curcumin for colon cancer metastasis required additional study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837d","authors":["Tong, Weihua","Wang, Quan","Sun, Donghui","Suo, Jian","Weihua Tong","Quan Wang","Donghui Sun","Jian Suo"],"doi":"10.3892\/ol.2016.5148","first_seen_on":"2016-12-01T17:34:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1792-1074","1792-1082"],"issue":"5","journal":"Oncology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1481585213,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27895783","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5104244\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5104244\/#!po=0.746269"],"pmcid":"PMC5104244","pmid":"27895783","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Spandidos Publications","startpage":"4139","title":"Curcumin suppresses colon cancer cell invasion via AMPK-induced inhibition of NF-\u03baB, uPA activator and MMP9","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/curcumin-suppresses-colon-cancer-cell-invasion-via-ampkinduced-inhibition-nfb-upa-activator-mmp9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.75,"score_history":{"1y":11.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":654854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7221649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254013,"mean":12.163237579327,"rank":33782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":220094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254013,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1220,"mean":1.2861345365053,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":1216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1220,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.9808,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
