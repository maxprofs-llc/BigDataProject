A difference in the 5-year cumulative disease recurrence rate between patients with high (\u22653.22) and low (<3.22) NLRs was significant (60.4 and 36.5%, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). A multivariate analysis confirmed that an NLR\u00a0\u22653.22 was an independent indicator of a poor prognosis for advanced hypopharyngeal SCC, as per the following parameters: overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.48-4.30, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), disease-specific survival (HR 2.45, 95% CI 1.38-4.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and disease-free survival (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.24-3.83, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Additional prognostic factors per the survival analyses included lymph node density, surgical margin, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion.\nAn NLR\u00a0\u22653.22 is associated with a higher risk of disease recurrence and poor survival in patients with T3-4 hypopharyngeal SCCs. We propose the use of the NLR to broaden the current TNM staging system; the development of a more effective treatment protocol for patients with high NLRs will be essential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a31","authors":["Lo, Wu-Chia","Wu, Chen-Tu","Wang, Cheng-Ping","Yang, Tsung-Lin","Lou, Pei-Jen","Ko, Jeng-Yuh","Chang, Yih-Leong"],"doi":"10.1245\/s10434-017-5865-8","first_seen_on":"2017-04-23T12:15:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1068-9265","1534-4681"],"journal":"Annals of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1492948265,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28432481?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28432481","pubdate":"2017-04-23T22:01:30+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"The Pretreatment Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio is a Prognostic Determinant of T3\u20134 Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pretreatment-neutrophiltolymphocyte-ratio-prognostic-determinant-t34-hypopharyngeal-squamous-cell-ca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091674,"mean":6.8840357008911,"rank":7005070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091674,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233282,"mean":12.745068814005,"rank":189855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233282,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2033,"mean":5.129469488189,"rank":1657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2033,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":12.541,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/856113193642369024","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19492350],"posted_on":"2017-04-23T11:51:05+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"856113193642369024"}]}}
