While a variety of methods have been used to measure CK-MB activity or mass in clinical laboratories, a CK-MB standard is needed to eliminate between-method bias. Because the in vitro expression of human creatine kinase generates three isoenzymes, CK-MM, CK-MB, and CK-BB, it is important to establish an effective method to purify the isoform CK-MB from the mixture. In this study, we aimed at using tandem affinity purification (TAP) to purify recombinant CK-MB protein and evaluate its value in clinical laboratories. After the optimized sequence coding CK-M and CK-B were synthesized, they were combined with TAP tags (6His and SBP) and inserted into a pRSFDuet vector; then, the constructed 6His-CK-M-SBP-CK-B-pRSF plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) for expression. After TAP, we obtained purified CK-MB protein. We also did recovery testing using the engineered CK-MB and standard CK-MB (Randox) at different concentrations, and the results suggested that the engineered CK-MB could be used as the reference material. Moreover, the stability study of recombinant CK-MB showed high stability during long-term storage at -80\u00a0\u00b0C. In conclusion, the TAP-purified recombinant CK-MB protein may be a much better and cheaper standard or reference material for clinical laboratories.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022dc","authors":["Zou, Lihui","Su, Wen","Wang, Meng","Huang, Wei","Zhao, Haijian","Zhang, Enyi","Jin, Junhua","Xu, Hongtao","Xiao, Fei"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00253-017-8286-5","first_seen_on":"2017-04-23T14:39:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0175-7598","1432-0614"],"journal":"Applied Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1493177825,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28432439?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28432439","pubdate":"2017-04-23T22:01:36+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Characterization of a functional recombinant human creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme prepared by tandem affinity purification from Escherichia coli\n        ","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083342,"mean":6.8946797770799,"rank":4029406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3847285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083342,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233946,"mean":12.756607057214,"rank":118781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":105114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233946,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2125,"mean":2.1304670433145,"rank":847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2125,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":2.5845050505051,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/856155479453581312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19494536],"posted_on":"2017-04-23T14:39:07+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
