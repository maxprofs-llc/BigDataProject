The replacement of hydrophobic amino acids by Ala reduced affinities, whereas the incorporation of L-2-aminooctanoic acid (Aoc) increased affinities. Replacing Nle-5, Ile-9 and Leu-12 by Aoc reduced the KD from 280 nM to 27 nM. Downsizing the 42-mer to an 11-mer gave rise to an order of magnitude lower affinity for GPa but the 11-mer where Nle-5, Ile-9 and Leu-12 were replaced by Aoc showed a KD of 550 nM, comparable to that of the parent 42-mer. The use of Aoc residues offers a convenient route to increased affinity in protein recognition as well as a strategy for the downsizing of peptides essentially without loss of affinity. The results show that hydrophobic binding sites may be found on protein surfaces by comparing affinities of polypeptide conjugates where Aoc residues have replaced Nle, Ile, Leu or Phe to those of the corresponding unmodified ones. Polypeptide conjugates thus provide valuable opportunities for the optimization of peptides and small organic molecules in biotechnology and biomedicine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd9","authors":["Baltzer, Lars","Balliu, Aleksandra"],"doi":"10.1002\/cbic.201700048","first_seen_on":"2017-04-23T10:22:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-7633","14394227"],"journal":"ChemBioChem","last_mentioned_on":1496898734,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28432776?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201700048\/abstract;jsessionid=1230007D61E020AF60677F46A3F96299.f03t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201700048\/pdf","pmid":"28432776","pubdate":"2017-04-23T22:00:42+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Exploring non-obvious hydrophobic binding pockets on protein surfaces - increasing affinities in peptide-protein interactions.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-nonobvious-hydrophobic-binding-pockets-protein-surfaces-increasing-affinities-peptideprote"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":2.1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":3579538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4720440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245333,"mean":12.802132294197,"rank":99034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":144183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245333,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2073,"mean":2.5192413127413,"rank":435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2073,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":2.1058441558442,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
