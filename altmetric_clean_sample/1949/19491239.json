A group of porcine oocytes maturated in vitro were injected with vitrified-warmed sperm (treatment group) and another group, with sperm diluted and conserved at 17\u00b0C (control group). To evidence parthenogenetic activation, some oocytes were submitted to a Sham test. The injected oocytes were cultured in G1 medium at 38\u00b0C, 100% humidity and 5% CO2 or tri-gas. No significant differences (p\u00a0>\u00a0.05) were observed in embryo development between the oocytes injected with vitrified-warmed sperm (31.8%; 36\/113), and those injected with semen diluted and conserved at 17\u00b0C (35.5%; 32\/90), when cultured in 5% CO2 or under tri-gas atmosphere (42.9%; 39\/91 vs. 34.2%; 26\/76, respectively). No significant differences (p\u00a0>\u00a0.05) were observed in the percentage of pronuclei (PN) obtained between 5% CO2 and tri-gas, within each treatment either. Of the 52 oocytes submitted to the Sham test, only two presented a female PN (activation) indicating that the PN observed in the treatment group were a product of fertilization and not parthenogenetic activation. To conclude, porcine sperm vitrified using spheres, at a concentration of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(6) \u00a0spermatozoa\/ml in TALP medium with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), conserve condensed and intact chromatin capable of producing early embryo development up to the pronuclear stage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003459","authors":["Arraztoa, CC","Baca Castex, C","Alvarez, GM","Cetica, PD","Neild, DM"],"doi":"10.1111\/rda.12978","first_seen_on":"2017-04-23T10:33:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0936-6768","1439-0531"],"journal":"Reproduction in Domestic Animals","last_mentioned_on":1492943567,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28432708?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28432708","pubdate":"2017-04-23T22:00:52+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"In vitro production of porcine zygotes using intracytoplasmic injection of vitrified sperm","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-production-porcine-zygotes-using-intracytoplasmic-injection-vitrified-sperm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091674,"mean":6.8840357008911,"rank":7005071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091674,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233282,"mean":12.745073529348,"rank":189855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233282,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":438,"mean":2.3526315789474,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":438,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.73333333333333,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/856093488781418496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19491239],"posted_on":"2017-04-23T10:32:47+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
