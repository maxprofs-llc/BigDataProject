This study will show the superficial peroneal nerve neuroma occurring after resection of hemangioma.\nA 44-year-old male had an operation of the right leg cavernous hemangioma resection in 1995. Half a year after the operation, pain around the wound appeared and gradually aggravated. The patient had the lesion exploration resection in 2013, and the pathological result showed traumatic neuroma. Within half a year of the second operation, severe pain showed up again, so neuroma resection proceeded in May 2015. The postoperative pathological and immunohistochemical results showed traumatic neuroma. According to the postoperative follow-up, there were no symptoms of pain appearing again.\nThe pain is obvious, and B ultrasonography is the most efficient way to find neuromas. Both conservative and operative therapy have their advantages and disadvantages.\nThere remain many unanswered questions in relation to the treatment of traumatic neuromas, and further research is required, although we have already had adequate understanding of traumatic neuromas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b8","authors":["Jian Kang","Pinglin Yang","Quanjin Zang","Xijing He"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12957-016-0990-6","first_seen_on":"2017-04-23T22:02:16+00:00","issns":["1477-7819"],"issue":"1","journal":"World Journal of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1492984923,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27613606?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews"],"pmid":"27613606","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"Traumatic neuroma of the superficial peroneal nerve in a patient: a case report and review of the literature","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/traumatic-neuroma-superficial-peroneal-nerve-patient-case-report-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091674,"mean":6.8840357008911,"rank":7005075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091674,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233283,"mean":12.744951809398,"rank":189857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233283,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1227,"mean":1.3274584013051,"rank":1049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1227,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnxietyNews\/statuses\/856266947326902272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19498989],"posted_on":"2017-04-23T22:02:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Social Anxiety Help","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/anxietynews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1133209691\/Anxiety-News-Logo_normal.jpg","description":"Latest News, Treatment, Helpful Information For Those Of Us Battling Social Anxiety, GAD, Depression TOGETHER WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER, TOGETHER WE CAN GIVE HOPE!","id_on_source":"AnxietyNews","tweeter_id":"195630483","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":3351},"tweet_id":"856266947326902272"}]}}
