Our objective was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of LGIT.\nFrom March 2014 to February 2015, 36 patients received LGIT at Severance Children's Hospital. One-year seizure outcomes and side effects were evaluated.\nA total of 36 patients were assessed. Fourteen were female. Common diagnoses were Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (33%, 12\/36) and Dravet syndrome (14%, 5\/36). The median age at the initiation of the LGIT was 12.6years (min.=1.5, max.=28, interquartile range (IQR) 8-17). After 3months of therapy, 20 (56%) patients experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, which was maintained in 19 (53%) patients for 1year. Two (6%) patients became seizure-free after 3months of LGIT; they remained seizure-free for 1year. These two had Dravet syndrome and generalized epilepsy. Only three (8%) patients discontinued treatment within 1year. Adverse events were rare, and two patients (6%) reported transient diarrhea.\nLGIT effectively reduced seizure frequency in the present study, although seizure freedom was infrequently achieved. LGIT may be considered as a therapeutic option for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, particularly those who find KD effective but intolerable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002425","authors":["Se Hee Kim","Hoon-Chul Kang","Eun Joo Lee","Joon Soo Lee","Heung Dong Kim"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.braindev.2017.03.027","first_seen_on":"2017-04-23T10:07:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03877604","1872-7131","0387-7604"],"journal":"Brain & Development","last_mentioned_on":1501672381,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28431772?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.brainanddevelopment.com\/article\/S0387-7604(17)30104-3\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.brainanddevelopment.com\/article\/S0387-7604%2817%2930104-3\/fulltext#.WYGzu5vj-AI.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.brainanddevelopment.com\/article\/S0387760417301043\/pdf","pmid":"28431772","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","pediatrics"],"title":"Low glycemic index treatment in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-glycemic-index-treatment-patients-drugresistant-epilepsy-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":2.5,"6m":2.5,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":3388166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4866927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244763,"mean":12.764781191524,"rank":91112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":151738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244763,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":638,"mean":2.237601255887,"rank":205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":638,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.352,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"ES":1,"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/statuses\/856087024075284480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19490822],"posted_on":"2017-04-23T10:07:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":158},"tweet_id":"856087024075284480"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedNeurBriefs\/statuses\/856123508891439105","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19490822],"posted_on":"2017-04-23T12:32:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Ped Neurology Briefs","url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricneurologybriefs.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763925960097800192\/QpZJcQcD_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric Neurology Briefs (PNB) is the leading journal review focusing on child neurology since 1987. #OpenAccess on #PubMed & #PubMedCentral.","id_on_source":"PedNeurBriefs","tweeter_id":"759957720","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":2069},"tweet_id":"856123508891439105"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DocLT\/statuses\/856142540755673088","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19490822],"posted_on":"2017-04-23T13:47:42+00:00","author":{"name":"L.D.A.","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/639153846166548480\/8_qoq_9X_normal.jpg","description":"I am Jo March, totally an ESTJ, & yet still 'just a person trapped inside a woman's body'.
