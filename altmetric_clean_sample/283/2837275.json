The BGO-NE was characterized and evaluated for dimensional as well as rheological changes periodically during a 12\u00a0week storage period. BGO comprising \u223c50\u00a0% \u03b1-eleostearic acid, was assessed in conventional and NE formulation at different doses, for its ability to stimulate antioxidative enzyme marker paradigm comprising SOD, GPx, CAT and GSH, inherent to the subjects under study. The formulated BGO-NE (d\u2009<\u2009100\u00a0nm) was found to be stable for 12\u00a0weeks compared to BGO-CE as was determined by particle size characterization and associated parameters. Diet supplementation of 0.5\u00a0% (w\/v) BGO-NE formulation exhibited maximum efficiency in countering oxidative stress as compared to 1\u00a0% BGO-NE formulation and equivalent doses of BGO-CE. Higher efficacy at very low dose of the nano-sized formulation was thus, also established. Histopathological data from liver, pancreas and kidney sections corroborated the above findings. The present study with formulated BGO-NE and BGO-CE evaluates and confirms the implications of a NE formulation of a bioactive lipid - conjugated linolenic acid (CLnA), targeting specific in vivo processes to counter the negative influence of excess ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) in the system. It, thus presents itself as a potent nutraceutical against diabetes mellitus in an optimized delivery system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c8c","authors":["Paul D","Dey TK","Mukherjee S","Ghosh M","Dhar P"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13197-014-1257-2","first_seen_on":"2014-11-01T06:56:47+00:00","issns":["0022-1155"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Food Science and Technology","last_mentioned_on":1414824832,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25190828"],"pmid":"25190828","pubdate":"2014-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry\/Food Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nutrition","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Comparative prophylactic effects of \u03b1-eleostearic acid rich nano and conventional emulsions in induced diabetic rats.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-prophylactic-effects-%CE%B1eleostearic-acid-rich-nano-conventional-emulsions-induced-diabetic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4453342,"mean":4.7934762963287,"rank":3440142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":131386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4453342,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123901,"mean":7.5991388539145,"rank":92368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123901,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":1.1931287878788,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.4869565217391,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
