End-of-treatment results are presented as an interim analysis of efficacy.\nFifty eligible MM patients with active HCV and concomitant liver fibrosis were treated with interferon\/ribavirin combination therapy using standard dosing regimens. Patients with active drug or alcohol use at the start of treatment, severe or untreated psychiatric illness, and\/or decompensated liver disease were excluded.\nTreated MM patients were older, had a longer history of HCV infection, a high prevalence of psychiatric illness, and had substantially more liver fibrosis than in previous studies of HCV treatment in non-opioid-dependent populations. Seventy-eight percent completed the 6-12 month course of treatment. The end-of-treatment virologic response rate was 64% in patients completing treatment and 54% on an intent-to-treat basis.\nMethadone maintenance patients exhibit a number of factors that make HCV treatment more difficult: they are older, have a higher prevalence of psychiatric illness, and show evidence of more advanced liver disease. Despite this, their end-of-treatment response rate to interferon\/ribavirin combination therapy is similar to that of patients without a history of IDU. Further analysis of the sustained virologic response (SVR) rate is planned at the study's completion. These preliminary results show that MM patients are in need of timely HCV diagnosis, and should be considered good candidates for referral and HCV treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002732","authors":["Diana L Sylvestre","Sylvestre, Diana L"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0376-8716(02)00010-8","endpage":"123","first_seen_on":"2014-11-01T10:55:47+00:00","issns":["03768716","0376-8716"],"issue":"2","journal":"Drug & Alcohol Dependence","last_mentioned_on":1480738719,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0376-8716(02)00010-8","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12095661"],"pmid":"12095661","pubdate":"2002-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"117","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Treating hepatitis C in methadone maintenance patients: an interim analysis","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treating-hepatitis-c-methadone-maintenance-patients-interim-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8163518,"mean":6.8970466082141,"rank":7062666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8163518,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202421,"mean":7.9770440766725,"rank":162473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202421,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3009,"mean":10.332550531915,"rank":2788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3009,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":17.2216,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
