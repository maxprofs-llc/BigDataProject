We recently demonstrated a narrow bias in the human TCR repertoire targeted at an immunodominant, but highly mutable, HLA-B*0801-restricted epitope ((1395)HSKKKCDEL(1403) [HSK]). To investigate if the narrow TCR repertoire facilitates CTL escape, structural and biophysical studies were undertaken, alongside comprehensive functional analysis of T cells targeted at the natural variants of HLA-B*0801-HSK in different HCV genotypes and quasispecies. Interestingly, within the TCR-HLA-B*0801-HSK complex, the TCR contacts all available surface-exposed residues of the HSK determinant. This broad epitope coverage facilitates cross-genotypic reactivity and recognition of common mutations reported in HCV quasispecies, albeit to a varying degree. Certain mutations did abrogate T cell reactivity; however, natural variants comprising these mutations are reportedly rare and transient in nature, presumably due to fitness costs. Overall, despite a narrow bias, the TCR accommodated frequent mutations by acting like a blanket over the hypervariable epitope, thereby providing effective viral immunity. Our findings simultaneously advance the understanding of anti-HCV immunity and indicate the potential for cross-genotype HCV vaccines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Usha K Nivarthi","Stephanie Gras","Lars Kjer-Nielsen","Richard Berry","Isabelle S Lucet","John J Miles","Samantha L Tracy","Anthony W Purcell","David S Bowden","Margaret Hellard","Jamie Rossjohn","James McCluskey","Mandvi Bharadwaj","Nivarthi UK","Gras S","Kjer-Nielsen L","Berry R","Lucet IS","Miles JJ","Tracy SL","Purcell AW","Bowden DS","Hellard M","Rossjohn J","McCluskey J","Bharadwaj M","Nivarthi, Usha K.","Gras, Stephanie","Kjer-Nielsen, Lars","Berry, Richard","Lucet, Isabelle S.","Miles, John J.","Tracy, Samantha L.","Purcell, Anthony W.","Bowden, David S.","Hellard, Margaret","Rossjohn, Jamie","McCluskey, James","Bharadwaj, Mandvi"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1401357","endpage":"5413","first_seen_on":"2014-11-01T05:50:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1550-6606","0022-1767"],"issue":"11","journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1415145632,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25355921\/","http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/193\/11\/5402.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"25355921","pubdate":"2014-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The American Association of Immunologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"5402","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"An Extensive Antigenic Footprint Underpins Immunodominant TCR Adaptability against a Hypervariable Viral Determinant","type":"article","volume":"193","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extensive-antigenic-footprint-underpins-immunodominant-tcr-adaptability-against-hypervariable-viral"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":3521057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4382527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201416,"mean":7.8370022689474,"rank":74252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":124407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201416,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7271,"mean":2.7047675378267,"rank":2991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7271,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196,"mean":2.9910051282051,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
