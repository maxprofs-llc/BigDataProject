It also occurs in second- and third-step geomorphic areas in China. Previous studies have postulated that high-altitude populations of R. oxycephalus in southern China are Quaternary glacial relics. In this study, we used the mitochondrial gene Cytb and the nuclear gene RAG2 to investigate the species phylogeographical patterns and to test two biogeographic hypotheses: (1) that divergence between lineages supports the three-step model and (2) climatic fluctuations during the Quaternary resulted in the present distribution in southern China.ResultsPhylogenetic analysis detected three major matrilines (A, B, and C); with matrilines B and C being further subdivided into two submatrilines. Based on genetic distances and morphological differences, matriline A potentially represents a cryptic subspecies. The geographic division between matrilines B and C coincided with the division of the second and third geomorphic steps in China, suggesting a historical vicariance event. Pliocene climatic fluctuations might have facilitated the southwards dispersal of R. oxycephalus in matriline C, with the subsequent warming resulting in its split into submatrilines C1 and C2, leaving submatriline C2 as a relic in southern China.ConclusionsOur study demonstrates that geological events (three steps orogenesis) and climate fluctuations during the Pliocene were important factors in shaping phylogeographical patterns in R. oxycephalus. Notably, no genetic diversity was detected in several populations, all of which possessed unique genotypes. This indicates the uniqueness of local populations and calls for a special conservation plan for the whole species at the population level.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b5","doi":"10.1186\/s12862-014-0225-9","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T21:55:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1414245708,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/14\/225\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12862-014-0225-9.pdf","pmid":"25344323","pubdate":"2014-10-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"225","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Geological events and Pliocene climate fluctuations explain the phylogeographical pattern of the cold water fish Rhynchocypris oxycephalus (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae) in China","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geological-events-pliocene-climate-fluctuations-explain-phylogeographical-pattern-cold-water-fish-rh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3057006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":930413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124820,"mean":8.4502286991566,"rank":82470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":30290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124820,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1432,"mean":7.3530761705101,"rank":1174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1432,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":11.67578125,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
