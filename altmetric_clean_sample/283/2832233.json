Altered thyroid hormone signaling may lead to a subclinical or overt hypothyroid condition that could contribute to nicotine withdrawal-related symptoms, such as cognitive deficits. Thus, normalizing thyroid hormone levels may represent a novel therapeutic target for ameliorating nicotine withdrawal-associated cognitive deficits.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50f3cf058f6100031e0","authors":["Prescott T.
