Due to the difficulty of collecting 3D kinematic and kinetic data with high accuracy, a possible relationship between injury statistic and joint loading has not been studied. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to compare ankle and knee joint loading at the steering leg between carved ski and snowboard turns. Kinetic data were collected using mobile force plates mounted under the toe and heel part of the binding on skies or snowboard (KISTLER). Kinematic data were collected with five synchronized, panning, tilting, and zooming cameras. An extended version of the Yeadon model was applied to calculate inertial properties of the segments. Ankle and knee joint forces and moments were calculated using inverse dynamic analysis. Results showed higher forces along the longitudinal axis in skiing and similar forces for skiing and snowboarding in anterior-posterior and mediolateral direction. Joint moments were consistently greater during a snowboard turn, but more fluctuations were observed in skiing. Hence, when comparing joint loading between carved ski and snowboard turns, one should differentiate between forces and moments, including the direction of forces and moments and the turn phase.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5223cf058f610003acc","authors":["Klous M","M\u00fcller E","Schwameder H"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/340272","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T09:26:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-670X"],"issue":"","journal":"Computational & Mathematical Methods in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1414300725,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25317202\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4181787","pmid":"25317202","pubdate":"2014-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Three-dimensional lower extremity joint loading in a carved ski and snowboard turn: a pilot study.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threedimensional-lower-extremity-joint-loading-carved-ski-snowboard-turn-pilot-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7291470,"mean":6.368340409316,"rank":5247638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1787459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7291470,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197853,"mean":7.7402017669775,"rank":117070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":69322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197853,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":1.4556853932584,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":9.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
