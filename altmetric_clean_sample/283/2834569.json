Inflammasome serves as a molecular platform that mediates the autoactivation of caspase-1, which cleaves the pro-forms of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 to active forms. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of NOD-like receptor-related protein (NLRP)1, NLRP3, and IPAF in the PBMCs of PV patients to determine their effect in PV pathogenesis. This study was designed as a cross-sectional study. We studied mRNA levels of three types of inflammasomes including NLRP1, NLRP3, and IPAF in 43 oral PV patients and 40 healthy controls by real-time PCR technique. Results were analyzed by SPSS software package version 18. Here, we showed that the mRNA levels of NLRP1 and IPAF in patients with active PV remarkably increased compared to those in healthy controls. However, the mRNA level of NLRP3 in PBMC of PV patients was similar to that of the control group. We showed important and emerging relationship of NLRP1 and IPAF mRNAs with PV disease progression. We hypothesize that NLRP1 and IPAF with cytokine activity of IL-1\u03b2 are involved in the inflammation in PV patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ac7","authors":["Shamsabadi RM","Basafa S","Yarahmadi R","Goorani S","Khani M","Kamarehei M","Hossein Kiani A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10753-014-0023-y","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T21:17:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-2576"],"issue":"","journal":"Inflammation","last_mentioned_on":1414250350,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25342284?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10753-014-0023-y"],"pmid":"25342284","pubdate":"2014-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pathology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Elevated Expression of NLRP1 and IPAF Are Related to Oral Pemphigus Vulgaris Pathogenesis","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/elevated-expression-nlrp1-ipaf-related-oral-pemphigus-vulgaris-pathogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4801869,"mean":5.7456840079767,"rank":3211263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1400486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4801869,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134880,"mean":8.8289068869136,"rank":86189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":42800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134880,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":340,"mean":1.3387256637168,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":340,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.3844186046512,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/526030213574971392","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2834569],"posted_on":"2014-10-25T15:19:10+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
