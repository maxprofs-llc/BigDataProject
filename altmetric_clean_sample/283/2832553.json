In recent years, near-ambient pressure techniques have allowed catalyst characterization under operating conditions, overcoming the pressure gap effect. However, the use of model systems may not truly represent the changes that occur in real catalysts (the so-called material gap effect). Supports can play an important role in the catalytic process by providing new active sites and may strongly affect both the physical and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles. We used near-ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to show that the surface rearrangement of bimetallic (rhodium-palladium) nanoparticles under working conditions for ethanol steam reforming with real catalysts is strongly influenced by the presence of a reducible ceria support.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["N\u00faria J.
