Design: Participants practiced concentrative meditation and then responded to visual stimuli while continuing to meditate. Participants: Ten experienced and 10 novice meditators responded to sequences of visual stimuli after concentrative meditation. Results: As predicted, both groups had increased parasympathetic activities during concentrative meditation. Experienced meditators had increased low-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms in response to visual stimulation, whereas novices had increased high-frequency EEG rhythms. Correlational analyses revealed that novice meditators changed from a meditative state to a nonrelaxed state when the visual stimuli were presented, whereas experienced meditators maintained the meditative state. Conclusion: The study provides evidence that regular concentrative meditation can improve emotional stability and that recording physiologic responses to visual stimuli can be a good method for identifying the effects of long-term concentrative meditation practice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c79","authors":["Yu-Hao Lee","Yung-Jong Shiah","Sharon Chia-Ju Chen","Shih-Feng Wang","Ming-Shing Young","Chih-Lung Lin"],"doi":"10.1089\/acm.2013.0465","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T21:16:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-7708"],"journal":"Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1414896557,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25354314"],"pmid":"25354314","pubdate":"2014-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Improved Emotional Stability in Experienced Meditators with Concentrative Meditation Based on Electroencephalography and Heart Rate Variability.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improved-emotional-stability-experienced-meditators-concentrative-meditation-based-electroencephalog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1921624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2542957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124820,"mean":8.450142975028,"rank":48384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":74721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124820,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1289,"mean":9.2259611801242,"rank":719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1289,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":8.2818888888889,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
