Genitalium in Asymptomatic Pts Under 30 Screened in French STI Clinic"],"citation":{"abstract":"Background: An increasing prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI) has been noted in France over the past decade. Asymptomatic carriage may be high in patients infected with Chlamydia trachomatis attending free and anonymous screening centres (CDAG) and information, diagnosis and screening centres for STI (CIDDIST). In these centres, systematic C.\u00a0trachomatis detection is recommended in women \u226425 years and in men \u226430 years. Objectives: This study aimed at estimating the prevalence of C.\u00a0trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium in asymptomatic patients younger than 30 years attending a CDAG-CIDDIST. Material and Methods: A free systematic screening for C.\u00a0trachomatis, N.\u00a0gonorrhoeae and M.\u00a0genitalium was offered to asymptomatic subjects under 30 years attending the Montpellier CDAG-CIDDIST from April to August 2009. Pathogens were identified by PCR in first void urine samples. Results: Of the 1381 subjects included (53.8% women and 46.2% men), 105 (42.9% men and 57.1% women) tested positive for C.\u00a0trachomatis (7.6%, 95% CI [6.3;9.13]); eight (seven men and one woman) tested positive for M.\u00a0genitalium (0.58% [0.2;1]) of whom two were infected with C.\u00a0trachomatis ; five (two men and three women) tested positive for N.\u00a0gonorrhoeae (0.36% [0.1;0.8]) of whom three were infected with C.\u00a0trachomatis. Conclusion: This study confirmed the need for C.\u00a0trachomatis screening in all patients under 30 years. Our results did not support a systematic screening for N.\u00a0gonorrhoeae and M.\u00a0genitalium in urine samples in this kind of facility.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007344","authors":["Clarivet B","Picot E","Marchandin H","Tribout V","Rachedi N","Schwartzentruber E","Led\u00e9sert B","Dereure O","Guillot B","Picot MC"],"doi":"10.1684\/ejd.2014.2413","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T18:40:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1167-1122"],"issue":"","journal":"European Journal of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1415861585,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25322708"],"pmid":"25322708","pubdate":"2014-10-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium in asymptomatic patients under 30 years of age screened in a French sexually transmitted infections clinic.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-chlamydia-trachomatis-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-mycoplasma-genitalium-asymptomatic-patients-u-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2443964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2543039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143707,"mean":8.7148700819731,"rank":66180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":76124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143707,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252,"mean":1.7795697211155,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.61666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
