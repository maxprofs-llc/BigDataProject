The ocular trauma is a major cause of preventable blindness worldwide; it constitutes the 7% of all corporal injury, and 10-15% of all eye diseases. The regenerative medicine research has opened the possibility to use stem cells as a source of cell replacement; so that experimental studies on embryonic stem cells and bone marrow stem cells have been carried out. In this study we analyzed the histopathological and spectroscopic changes in ocular tissue with trauma, treated with mouse pluripotent stem cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b6","authors":["Gustavo Jes\u00fas V\u00e1zquez-Zapi\u00e9n","Marlon Rojas-L\u00f3pez","Ra\u00fal Jacobo Delgado-Macuil","Luis Rub\u00e9n Mart\u00ednez-Nava","David Guillermo P\u00e9rez-Ishiwara","M\u00f3nica Maribel Mata-Miranda"],"doi":"10.1186\/scrt509","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T19:15:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-6512"],"issue":"5","journal":"Stem Cell Research & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1415719960,"links":["http:\/\/stemcellres.com\/content\/5\/5\/119\/abstract","http:\/\/stemcellres.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/scrt509"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/stemcellres.com\/content\/pdf\/scrt509.pdf","pmid":"25331456","pubdate":"2014-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"119","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Histologic and spectroscopic study of pluripotent stem cells after implanting in ocular traumatic injuries in a murine model","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histologic-spectroscopic-study-pluripotent-stem-cells-after-implant-ocular-traumatic-injuries-murine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8012961,"mean":6.7696029684366,"rank":1018175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":6972897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8012961,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201617,"mean":7.9250893579876,"rank":30539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":170641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201617,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":639,"mean":4.8862445141066,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":639,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":28.051083333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
