State laws require immunizations for school entry, however some parents choose a nonmedical exemption for their children. Although many vaccine-preventable diseases are practically extinct in the United States, nurses have a unique role in increasing parents' understanding that herd immunity may not protect their unimmunized children. By listening to and addressing parents' concerns about immunizations, nurses can dispel misconceptions and help change parents' perceptions about the risks associated with immunizations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b16","authors":["Wade GH"],"doi":"10.1097\/nmc.0000000000000083","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T09:52:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0361-929X"],"issue":"6","journal":"MCN: The American Journal of Maternal Child Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1417842704,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/mcnjournal\/Abstract\/2014\/11000\/Nurses_as_Primary_Advocates_for_Immunization.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/mcnjournal\/2014\/11000\/Nurses_as_Primary_Advocates_for_Immunization.3.pdf","pmid":"25333801","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"351","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Nurses as Primary Advocates for Immunization Adherence","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nurses-primary-advocates-immunization-adherence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4747790,"mean":5.7056333468087,"rank":2189990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2437272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4747790,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132047,"mean":8.8598724989778,"rank":56608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":71038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132047,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":566,"mean":1.1655150442478,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":566,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.3571428571429,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
