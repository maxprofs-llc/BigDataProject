Knockdown of KSHV miR-K12-3 and miR-K12-11 increased expression of lytic genes in BC-3 cells, and increased virus production from latently infected BCBL-1 cells. Furthermore, iSLK cells infected with miR-K12-3 and miR-K12-11 deletion mutant viruses displayed increased spontaneous reactivation and were more sensitive to inducers of reactivation than cells infected with wild type KSHV. Predicted binding sites for miR-K12-3 and miR-K12-11 were found in the 3'UTRs of the cellular transcription factors MYB, Ets-1, and C\/EBP\u03b1, which activate RTA, the KSHV replication and transcription activator. Targeting of MYB by miR-K12-11 was confirmed by cloning the MYB 3'UTR downstream from the luciferase reporter. Knockdown of miR\u2011K12-11 resulted in increased levels of MYB transcript, and knockdown of miR-K12-3 increased both C\/EBP\u03b1 and Ets-1 transcripts. Thus, miR-K12-11 and miR-K12-3 contribute to maintenance of latency by decreasing RTA expression indirectly, presumably via down\u2011regulation of MYB, C\/EBP\u03b1 and Ets-1, and possibly other host transcription factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f610004704","authors":["Plaisance-Bonstaff K","Choi HS","Beals T","Krueger BJ","Boss IW","Gay LA","Haecker I","Hu J","Renne R"],"doi":"10.3390\/v6104005","endpage":"4023","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T18:39:39+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nci"],"issns":["","1999-4915"],"issue":"10","journal":"Viruses (1999-4915)","last_mentioned_on":1414267147,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25341664?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25341664","pubdate":"2014-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"4005","title":"KSHV miRNAs Decrease Expression of Lytic Genes in Latently Infected PEL and Endothelial Cells by Targeting Host Transcription Factors.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kshv-mirnas-decrease-expression-lytic-genes-latently-infected-pel-endothelial-cells-targeting-host-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4414439,"mean":4.8232878066453,"rank":3425554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":130298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4414439,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122270,"mean":7.7017177698354,"rank":92223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122270,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":632,"mean":1.8828621236133,"rank":397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":632,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.81428571428571,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
