The gene was named BoIFN-\u03b11 according to the position at which the encoded gene of the bovine IFN was located in the bovine genome. The sequence included a 23-amino-acid signal peptide and a 166-amino-acid mature peptide. The structural characteristics and phylogenetic relationships of the BoIFN-\u03b11 gene were analyzed. A recombinant mature BoIFN-\u03b11 (rBoIFN-\u03b11) was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Physicochemical characteristics and antiviral activity were determined in vitro. Recombinant BoIFN-\u03b11 was found to be highly sensitive to trypsin and stable at pH 2.0 or 65\u00b0C. It also exhibited antiviral activity, which was neutralized by a rabbit anti-rBoIFN\u03b1 polyclonal antibody. This study revealed that rBoIFN-\u03b11 has the typical characteristics of IFN\u03b1 and can be used for both research and industrial application.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e09","authors":["Shao J","Cao C","Bao J","Liu H","Peng T","Gao M","Wang J"],"doi":"10.1089\/jir.2013.0139","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T22:44:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1079-9907"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Interferon & Cytokine Research","last_mentioned_on":1414239244,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25343404?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25343404","pubdate":"2014-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Characterization of Bovine Interferon \u03b1<sub>1<\/sub>: Expression in Yeast Pichia pastoris, Biological Activities, and Physicochemical Characteristics.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-bovine-interferon-%CE%B11-expression-yeast-pichia-pastoris-biological-activities-physico"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4414439,"mean":4.8232878066453,"rank":3174124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":989045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4414439,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122270,"mean":7.7022759652897,"rank":83283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":30000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122270,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216,"mean":3.8159813953488,"rank":139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":3.445652173913,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/525983631030755333","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2835058],"posted_on":"2014-10-25T12:14:04+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
