Comparative analyses of bacterial plasmids, including homology searches, phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses, as well as network construction for the characterization of their relationships, are good starting points for the identification of chromids. Chromids possess several chromosome-like genetic features (e.g., codon usage, GC content), but most significantly, they carry housekeeping genes, which make them indispensable for cell viability. However, it is important to confirm in silico predictions experimentally. The essential nature of a predicted chromid is usually verified by the application of a target-oriented replicon curing technique, based on the incompatibility phenomenon. Further tests examining growth in various media are used to distinguish secondary chromids from plasmids, and mutational analysis (e.g., using the yeast FLP\/FRT recombination system) is employed to identify essential genes carried by particular chromids.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Dziewit L","Bartosik D"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-1720-4_2","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T06:06:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1064-3745"],"issue":"","journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1414329902,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25343856?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25343856","pubdate":"2014-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Bacteriology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetic Engineering","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Comparative analyses of extrachromosomal bacterial replicons, identification of chromids, and experimental evaluation of their indispensability.","type":"article","volume":"1231","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-analyses-extrachromosomal-bacterial-replicons-identification-chromids-experimental-evalu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4417810,"mean":4.8211342378733,"rank":3173405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":991736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4417810,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122317,"mean":7.6863110467969,"rank":83046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":30231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122317,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3045,"mean":1.4118580814717,"rank":1474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3045,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.1817575757576,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
