Our recent work on these cells has investigated how fuel metabolism, especially glutamine metabolism, is related to the specific function of these cells in the inflammatory response. The high rate of glutamine utilization and its metabolism in such immune cells has raised the question of why glutamine is responsible for these functions. The macrophage has access to a variety of metabolic fuels both in vivo and in vitro. The quantitatively important role of glutamine in the processes of free radical and cytokine production has been established in our laboratories. Our current understanding of the rate of utilization and the pathway of metabolism of glutamine by cells of the immune system raises some intriguing questions concerning therapeutic manipulation of utilization of this amino acid, specifically the phagocytic and secretory capacities of cells of the defense system can be beneficially altered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8f","authors":["Newsholme P","Curi R","Pithon Curi TC","Murphy CJ","Garcia C","Pires de Melo M"],"first_seen_on":"2014-11-01T07:42:59+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1414827765,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15539305"],"pmid":"15539305","pubdate":"2004-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Glutamine metabolism by lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils: its importance in health and disease.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glutamine-metabolism-lymphocytes-macrophages-neutrophils-importance-health-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3553198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":837311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143748,"mean":8.7112166514781,"rank":97809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":28401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143748,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":667,"mean":5.1722702702703,"rank":433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":667,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.7921052631579,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
