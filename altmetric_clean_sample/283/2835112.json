Planning and implementation of an open door psychiatric ward: the assessment of an experience in\u2008Piedmont. Aims. The planning of the structure and the activity of a newly created psychiatric ward are reported. Methods. Several choices characterized the activity of the ward: to have open doors, newly employed nurses or without experience in psychiatry, a structure that favour the contact between health professionals (HP) and patients. The education of the nurses consisted in the discussion of general principles that guided the clinical practice: the patient is a legal person, his freedom should be guaranteed as well as his right of self determination. Results. The ward was opened in April 2008. Over 55 months 722 patients were admitted (31 compulsory admission). Only 8 patients were restrained and 4 aggressions occurred; 14 patients left the ward without authorization. Pharmacological deep sedation was used only in exceptional circumstances. Conclusions. Patients can be cared, safely for patients and PS in an open doors psychiatric ward. The planning of physical spaces is fundamental in guaranteeing a care respectful of patients' rights.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000574a","authors":["Piccoli M","Tiraferri R"],"doi":"10.1702\/1648.18030","first_seen_on":"2014-10-31T22:57:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1592-5986"],"issue":"3","journal":"Assistenza Infermieristica e Ricerca","last_mentioned_on":1414237767,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25343415?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25343415","pubdate":"2014-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"[In Process Citation].","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/planning-implementation-open-door-psychiatric-ward-assessment-experience-piedmont"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2900218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1450665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124820,"mean":8.4506473052983,"rank":77896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":42327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124820,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.76333333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/status\/525952798379089923","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2835112],"posted_on":"2014-10-25T10:11:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
