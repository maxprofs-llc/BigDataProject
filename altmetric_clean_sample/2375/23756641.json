Young and middle-aged men were randomly assigned to, a young training group (YT = 10, 21.4\u00b11.2yrs) ora young control group (YC = 9, 21.6\u00b11.8 yrs), a middle-aged training group (MAT = 10, 40.4\u00b12.1 yrs) or a middle-aged control group (MAC = 9, 40.5\u00b11.8 yrs). Participants performed the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT) before and after a 13-week CSRT program (three sessions per week). Blood samples were collected at rest, after warm-up, immediately post-WAnT, and 10 min post-WAnT. CSRT induced increases in GH at rest and in response to the WAnT in YT and MAT (P<0.05). CSRT-induced increases were observed for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 at rest in MAT only (P<0.05). Pre-training, GH, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were significantly higher at rest and in response to the WAnT in young participants as compared to their middle-aged counterparts (P<0.05). Post-training, YT and MAT had comparable basal GH (P>0.05). In response to the WAnT, amelioration of the age-effect was observed between YT and MAT for IGF-1 and IGF-1\/IGFBP-3 ratio following CSRT (P>0.05). These data suggest that CSRT increases the activity of the GH\/IGF-1 axis at rest and in response to the WAnT in young and middle-aged men. In addition, CSRT reduces the normal age-related decline of somatotropic hormones in middle-age men.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sellami, Maha","Dhahbi, Wissem","Hayes, Lawrence D.","Padulo, Johnny","Rhibi, Fatma","Djemail, Hanen","Chaouachi, Anis","Maha Sellami","Wissem Dhahbi","Lawrence D.
