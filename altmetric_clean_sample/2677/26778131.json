CARPREG and ZAHARA risk scores, and modified WHO (mWHO) risk classification were applied retrospectively. Predictive accuracy was compared by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.\nA total of 730 women were included. The frequency of expected versus observed cardiac events was, respectively, 5.0% versus 7.8%, 27.0% versus 47.1%, and 75.0% versus 75.0% among patients with CARPREG scores of 0, 1, and >1; and 2.9% versus 5.8%, 7.5% versus 36.5%, 17.5% versus 30.8%, 43.1% versus 50.0%, and 70.0% versus 17.6% among those with ZAHARA scores of 0-0.50, 0.51-1.50, 1.51-2.50, 2.51-3.50, and 3.51 or more. For mWHO risk classification I-IV, the cardiac events rate was 0%, 8.2%, 26.7%, 18.4%, and 15.4%, respectively. The area under the curve was 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.76; P<0.001) for mWHO, 0.68 (95% CI 0.60-0.75; P<0.001) for ZAHARA, and 0.63 (95% CI 0.57-0.71; P=0.001) for CARPREG.\nThe mWHO risk classification was the best system for predicting cardiac complications among Chinese pregnant women with CHD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b55","authors":["Fu, Qin","Lin, Jianhua"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijgo.2016.02.010","endpage":"144","first_seen_on":"2017-09-29T16:40:31+00:00","issns":["00207292","1879-3479"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics","last_mentioned_on":1506727467,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1016\/j.ijgo.2016.02.010\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1016\/j.ijgo.2016.02.010\/pdf","pmid":"27177511","pubdate":"2016-04-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"140","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Predictive accuracy of three clinical risk assessment systems for cardiac complications among Chinese pregnant women with congenital heart disease","type":"article","volume":"134","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictive-accuracy-three-clinical-risk-assessment-systems-cardiac-complications-among-chinese-pregn-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":2.1,"3m":2.1,"1m":2.1,"1w":2.1,"6d":2.1,"5d":2.1,"4d":2.1,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":3644326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4780720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111420,"mean":11.429855661961,"rank":41050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":69359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111420,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1803,"mean":3.8822719200888,"rank":1076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1803,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.33125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"GR":1},"mendeley":{"IR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IJGOLive\/statuses\/913805641218760709","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26778131],"posted_on":"2017-09-29T16:40:17+00:00","author":{"name":"IJGO","url":"http:\/\/www.wileyonlinelibrary.com\/journal\/ijgo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/781509770654183424\/0xM-D9uk_normal.jpg","description":"The International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics\u2014FIGO\u2019s official publication\u2014contains research&communications on women\u2019s issues for international readers","id_on_source":"IJGOLive","tweeter_id":"2676487332","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":1257},"tweet_id":"913805641218760709"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/panosants\/statuses\/913813302609932289","license":"gnip","rt":["IJGOLive"],"citation_ids":[26778131],"posted_on":"2017-09-29T17:10:43+00:00","author":{"name":"panos antsaklis","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000591652345\/c91a3871ec74b630ec4be6631bbcef61_normal.jpeg","description":"Obstetrician & Gynecologist -
