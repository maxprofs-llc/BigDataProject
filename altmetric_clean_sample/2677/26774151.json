ChAc is characterized by progressive chorea, dystonia, and psychiatric symptoms, developing in young adulthood, often with acanthocytosis in peripheral blood. Tongue protrusion, or feeding dystonia, is common, as are seizures and neuropathy [1]. On neuropathology, there is basal ganglia atrophy, neuronal loss, and gliosis, especially in the caudate nucleus [2]. We report the case of a patient with ChAc with hippocampal sclerosis who had extensive longitudinal follow-up, including neuropathology and general autopsy. This article is protected by copyright.
