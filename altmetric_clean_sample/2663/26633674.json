Our primary objective was to appraise the impact of ceasing ASC on the incidence of ICU-acquired ESBL-E infections in an ICU with universal contact precautions (CP). Patient outcomes and carbapenem consumption were also investigated.\nA single-ICU, retrospective, uncontrolled before-and-after study including all patients admitted for \u2265 3 days during two consecutive one-year periods with and without ASC.\nA total of 524 and 545 patients were included during the ASC and the no-ASC periods, respectively. Twenty-eight patients (5.3%) from the ASC period were ESBL-E carriers. An ICU-acquired ESBL-E infection (median duration of risk exposure, 4 [2-9] days for both periods) occurred in 1.1% and 1.5% of patients admitted during the ASC and the no-ASC periods (P=0.64), with no inter-period variation in incidence after adjustment on competing risks of death and ICU discharge [standardized hazard ratio (SHR), 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80-6.73, P=0.12]. An admission during the no-ASC period exerted no independent impact on the hazards of ESBL-E infections (adjusted odds ratio, 1.16, 95%CI, 0.38-3.50, P=0.79), in-ICU death (SHR, 1.22, 95%CI, 0.93-1.59, P=0.15) and extended length of stay (SHR for discharge, 0.89, 95%CI, 0.79-1.01, P=0.08). Carbapenem exposure in patients without ESBL-E infection decreased between the ASC and no-ASC periods (75 versus 61 carbapenem-days per 1,000 patient-days, P=0.01).\nIn a low-endemicity ICU with universal CP, the withdrawal of routine screening for ESBL-E carriage had no significant effect on the incidence of ICU-acquired ESBL-E infections and patient outcomes. Carbapenem consumption decreased in patients without ESBL-E infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000e10","authors":["Wajma Jalalza\u00ef","Maxime Boutrot","J\u00e9r\u00f4me Guinard","Aur\u00e9lie Guigon","Laurent Bret","Didier-Marc Poisson","Thierry Boulain","Fran\u00e7ois Barbier"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cmi.2017.08.005","first_seen_on":"2017-09-27T07:55:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1198-743X","1198743X","1469-0691"],"journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","last_mentioned_on":1506884221,"links":["http:\/\/www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com\/article\/S1198-743X%2817%2930432-9\/fulltext#.WctYf-lgySI.twitter","http:\/\/www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com\/article\/S1198-743X(17)30432-9\/fulltext"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com\/article\/S1198743X17304329\/pdf","pmid":"28962997","pubdate":"2017-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Cessation of screening for intestinal carriage of ESBL-producing  Enterobacteriaceae  in a low-endemicity ICU with universal contact precautions","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":3.35,"6m":3.35,"3m":3.35,"1m":3.35,"1w":3.35,"6d":3.35,"5d":3.1,"4d":3.1,"3d":0.5,"2d":0.5,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462593,"mean":7.1086032149407,"rank":2070760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6370512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462593,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114263,"mean":11.499833137876,"rank":32851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":80954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114263,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1745,"mean":4.4968337155963,"rank":465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1745,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":7.376,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"CH":1,"BR":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Onisillos\/statuses\/912948738271989760","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26633674],"posted_on":"2017-09-27T07:55:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Onisillos Sekkides","url":"http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/laninf\/about","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/482446447455899648\/jI6GsiZq_normal.png","description":"Deputy Editor of @TheLancetInfDis.
