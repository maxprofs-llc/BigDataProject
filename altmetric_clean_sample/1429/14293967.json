This study investigated and compared the effect of pre-dive oxygenation, pre-dive whole body vibration or a combination of both on post-dive bubble formation. Methods: Six healthy volunteers performed 6 no-decompression dives each, to a depth of 33 mfw for 20 min (3 control dives without preconditioning and 1 of each preconditioning protocol) with a minimum interval of 1 week between each dive. Post-dive bubbles were counted in the precordium by two-dimensional echocardiography, 30 and 90 min after the dive, with and without knee flexing. Each diver served as his own control. Results: Vascular gas emboli (VGE) were systematically observed before and after knee flexing at each post-dive measurement. Compared to the control dives, we observed a decrease in VGE count of 23.8 \u00b1 7.4% after oxygen breathing (p < 0.05), 84.1 \u00b1 5.6% after vibration (p < 0.001), and 55.1 \u00b1 9.6% after vibration combined with oxygen (p < 0.001). The difference between all preconditioning methods was statistically significant. Conclusions: The precise mechanism that induces the decrease in post-dive VGE and thus makes the diver more resistant to decompression stress is still not known. However, it seems that a pre-dive mechanical reduction of existing gas nuclei might best explain the beneficial effects of this strategy. The apparent non-synergic effect of oxygen and vibration has probably to be understood because of different mechanisms involved.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc19","authors":["Balestra, Costantino","Theunissen, Sigrid","Papadopoulou, Virginie","Le Mener, Cedric","Germonpr\u00e9, Peter","Guerrero, Fran\u00e7ois","Laf\u00e8re, Pierre"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphys.2016.00586","first_seen_on":"2016-12-02T16:53:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-042X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1480697615,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphys.2016.00586\/full?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphys.2016.00586\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC5127795","pmid":"27965591","pubdate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Pre-dive Whole-Body Vibration Better Reduces Decompression-Induced Vascular Gas Emboli than Oxygenation or a Combination of Both","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predive-wholebody-vibration-better-reduces-decompressioninduced-vascular-gas-emboli-oxygenation-comb"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":6787548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250759,"mean":12.164052544684,"rank":203509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250759,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2640,"mean":5.2487646835923,"rank":1686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2640,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264,"mean":8.9023954372624,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":4},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontPhysiol\/statuses\/804730241985888256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14293967],"posted_on":"2016-12-02T16:53:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Physiol","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Physiology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533286083207766016\/8U7NEYhH_normal.jpeg","description":"Frontiers in Physiology is the largest open-access journal in the field of Physiology.","id_on_source":"FrontPhysiol","tweeter_id":"397339470","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":2030},"tweet_id":"804730241985888256"}]}}
