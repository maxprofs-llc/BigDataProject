In this study, several popular extraction methods were tested, including Chelex-100, phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (PCIA), DNA IQ, PrepFiler, and QIAamp Investigator, and the quantity of DNA recovered from chewing gum was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction with Quantifiler. Chewed gum control samples were submitted by anonymous healthy adult donors, and discarded environmental chewing gum samples simulating forensic evidence were collected from outside public areas (e.g., campus bus stops, streets, and sidewalks). As expected, results indicate that all methods tested yielded sufficient amplifiable human DNA from chewing gum using the wet-swab method. The QIAamp performed best when DNA was extracted from whole pieces of control gum (142.7\u2009ng on average), and the DNA IQ method performed best on the environmental whole gum samples (29.0\u2009ng on average). On average, the QIAamp kit also recovered the most DNA from saliva swabs. The PCIA method demonstrated the highest yield with wet swabs of the environmental gum (26.4\u2009ng of DNA on average). However, this method should be avoided with whole gum samples (no DNA yield) due to the action of the organic reagents in dissolving and softening the gum and inhibiting DNA recovery during the extraction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008147","authors":["Alison M Eychner","Kelly M Schott","Kelly M Elkins"],"doi":"10.1177\/0025802416676413","first_seen_on":"2016-10-29T02:00:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2042-1818","0025-8024"],"journal":"Medicine, Science and the Law","last_mentioned_on":1477741789,"links":["http:\/\/msl.sagepub.com\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/0025802416676413v1?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/0025802416676413"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/msl.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/28\/0025802416676413.full.pdf","pmid":"27794077","pubdate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"Assessing DNA recovery from chewing gum","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessing-dna-recovery-chewing-gum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7615205,"mean":6.556701012339,"rank":3292040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4237420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7615205,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234910,"mean":12.717748464299,"rank":101584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":129697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234910,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":3.9682288557214,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.9166666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ForensicResrch\/statuses\/792184338922123264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13112635],"posted_on":"2016-10-29T02:00:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Forensic Research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/696349157078990851\/togmuXzm_normal.jpg","description":"Stay up-to-date with the latest publications in the field of Forensics \/\/ Feed from several scientific journals and websites","id_on_source":"ForensicResrch","tweeter_id":"4884945395","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":80},"tweet_id":"792184338922123264"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cobra10justice\/statuses\/792332608264740864","license":"gnip","rt":["ForensicResrch"],"citation_ids":[13112635],"posted_on":"2016-10-29T11:49:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Cobra","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/812057671503183872\/8xXAnorm_normal.jpg","description":"Lawyer|Advocates High Court|Property Expert|Techno-Legal Consultant|Forensic Analyst| Author of A QUANTUM IN CREATOR: VOL 1-7(unpublished) cobraten10@gmail.com","id_on_source":"cobra10justice","tweeter_id":"3659033124","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":62},"tweet_id":"792332608264740864"}]}}
