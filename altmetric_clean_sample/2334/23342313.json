Perceptions were measured using modified items from the MacArthur Perceived Coercion and Negative Pressure Scales. A majority reported that they \"chose to\" (88.4%) or \"felt free to\" (85.5%) enroll. Most reported having \"control over\" (69.6%) and \"more influence than anyone else\" regarding (60.9%) their participation. About half reported that enrollment was \"their idea\" (49.3%). Fewer reported perceptions of negative pressure, including the feeling that someone \"talked them into\" enrolling (24.6%), \"threatened them with the maximum criminal punishment\" (13.0%), \"offered or promised them something\" (5.8%), or \"forced\" them to enroll (5.8%). Nobody felt \"tricked, lied to, or fooled into\" participating. Total negative pressure scores were higher in those with combat experience, U\u00a0=\u00a0406.50, p\u00a0=\u00a0.016. Although potentially inappropriate pressures were reported, these data suggest that the majority perceived enrollment as voluntary.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023a9","authors":["Trojano, Max L.","Christopher, Paul P.","Pinals, Debra A.","Harnish, Autumn","Smelson, David"],"doi":"10.1002\/bsl.2299","first_seen_on":"2017-08-01T12:33:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0735-3936","1099-0798"],"journal":"Behavioral Sciences & the Law","last_mentioned_on":1503564908,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bsl.2299\/abstract;jsessionid=0E1767F41D8D1C3138AE3165EA4E913F.f02t04","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28762534","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/bsl.2299"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bsl.2299\/pdf","pmid":"28762534","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","jurisprudence"],"title":"Perceptions of voluntary consent among jail diverted veterans with co-occurring disorders","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.33,"score_history":{"1y":8.33,"6m":8.33,"3m":8.33,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":1081105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7339712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220903,"mean":12.736640863369,"rank":40444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":180347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220903,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":437,"mean":6.7752935779817,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":437,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.442,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Wiley_Law\/statuses\/892362491438792704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23342313],"posted_on":"2017-08-01T12:32:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Wiley Law","url":"http:\/\/www.wileyonlinelibrary.com\/subject\/law","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/487187122932035584\/ZbwyAOBW_normal.jpeg","description":"Expert research, legal news, law resources and free content from Wiley #Law and #Criminology titles","id_on_source":"Wiley_Law","tweeter_id":"278067922","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":896},"tweet_id":"892362491438792704"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Why_We_Do_That\/statuses\/893199951165095937","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23342313],"posted_on":"2017-08-03T20:00:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Why_We_Do_That","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/779459146\/Rorschach_4_normal.jpg","description":"Psychology; how, why & what not.
