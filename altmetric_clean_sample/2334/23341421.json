Only few studies directly compare RVATS to the mainstay therapy, open surgery (sternotomy).\nA systematic search of the literature was performed in October 2016. The meta-analysis includes studies comparing robotassisted and open thymectomy regarding operation time, length of hospitalization, intraoperative blood loss, and chest-in-tube days, postoperative complications, reoperation, arrhythmic events, pleural effusion, and postoperative bleeding.\nOf 626 studies preliminary screened, 7 articles were included. There were no significant differences in comparison of operation time (-3.19 minutes [95% confidence interval, 95% CI -112.43 to 106.05]; P\u200a=\u200a.94), but patients undergoing RVATS spent significantly less time in hospital (-4.06 days [95% CI -7.98 to -0.13], P\u200a=\u200a.046). There were fewer chests-in-tube days (-2.50 days [95% CI -15.01 to 10.01]; P\u200a=\u200a.24) and less intraoperative blood loss (-256.84\u200amL [95% CI -627.47 to 113.80]; P\u200a=\u200a.10) observed in the RVATS group; due to a small number of studies, these results were not statistically significant. There were also less post-operative complications in the RVATS group (12 complications in 209 patients vs 51 complications in 259 patients); however, this difference was not statistical significant (odds ratio 0.27, 95% CI 0.07-1.12; P\u200a=\u200a.06).\nPatients undergoing RVATS spent less time in hospital than patients treated by open surgery (sternotomy). These patients tended to have less postoperative complications, less intraoperative blood loss, and fewer chest-in-tube days. We found evidence for the safety and feasibility of RVATS compared with open surgery, which has to be further confirmed in randomised controlled trials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Buentzel, Judith","Straube, Carmen","Heinz, Judith","Roever, Christian","Beham, Alexander","Emmert, Andreas","Hinterthaner, Marc","Danner, Bernhard C.","Emmert, Alexander"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000007161","first_seen_on":"2017-08-01T11:56:22+00:00","issns":["0025-7974"],"issue":"24","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1501587046,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2017\/06160\/Thymectomy_via_open_surgery_or_robotic_video.35.aspx?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/2017\/06160\/Thymectomy_via_open_surgery_or_robotic_video.35.pdf","pmid":"28614249","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e7161","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Thymectomy via open surgery or robotic video assisted thoracic surgery","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2017\/06160\/Thymectomy_via_open_surgery_or_robotic_video.35.aspx","volume":"96","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thymectomy-via-open-surgery-robotic-video-assisted-thoracic-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":6006979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2004221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172301,"mean":11.690127266396,"rank":111222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":50707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172301,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4148,"mean":2.9593098625512,"rank":2066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4148,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":1.970406504065,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MedicineLWW\/statuses\/892346862014824448","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23341421],"posted_on":"2017-08-01T11:30:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Medicine LWW","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/569172208866439168\/f3-9P_th_normal.jpeg","description":"Medicine offers open access publication of original research across a broad spectrum of medical scientific disciplines and sub-specialties.","id_on_source":"MedicineLWW","tweeter_id":"217116133","geo":{"lt":39.29038,"ln":-76.61219,"country":"US"},"followers":169},"tweet_id":"892346862014824448"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Medicine LWW on Twitter","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1720936274602123&id=170363419659424","license":"public","citation_ids":[23341421],"posted_on":"2017-08-01T11:30:46+00:00","summary":"Current Issue: Thymectomy via open surgery or robotic video assisted thoracic surgery: Can a recommendation already\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/dPqhriYRG4 https:\/\/t.co\/oLEaXnBw0l","author":{"name":"Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/170363419659424","facebook_wall_name":"Medicine","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/170363419659424\/picture","id_on_source":"170363419659424"}}]}}
