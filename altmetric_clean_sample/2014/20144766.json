The study is centred on BP Chemicals Ltd, Baglan Bay, Port Talbot, West Glamorgan, South Wales and includes a general population sample of 115,721 people (1981 census) living within 7.5 km of the plant. Cancer incidence and mortality for all cancers, leukaemias, and cancer of the larynx were examined within 7.5 km and 3 km of the plant, and tests for decline in risk of these cancers with distance from the plant were carried out. Mortality from several other cancers possibly associated with the petrochemical industry was also studied.\nThere were 5417 incident cancer cases and 2458 cancer deaths within 7.5 km of the plant during the periods of study. There was an 8% excess incidence of all cancers within 7.5 km, and a 24% excess of cancer of the larynx, consistent with a general excess of these cancers in West Glamorgan, but no apparent decline in incidence with distance from the plant, nor excess mortality. There was also no evidence of decline in leukaemia incidence or mortality with distance, at all ages or in children. Among the other causes included in the mortality study, there was an excess of multiple myeloma within 7.5 km, especially among women, and a significant decline in mortality from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas although there was no excess overall within 7.5 km.\nThe apparent excess incidence of all cancers and cancer of the larynx within 7.5 km of the BP Chemical Ltd works was consistent with an excess more generally in West Glamorgan, possibly related, at least to some extent, to cancer registration in Wales. There was no excess mortality from these cancers. The results for multiple myeloma and especially non-Hodgkin's lymphomas may have been chance findings in view of the multiple tests of significance carried out in the study. A study of lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers near oil refineries in Great Britain is to be undertaken that will help put the findings of the present study in wider context.","altmetric_jid":"52b2ceaa3cf058a06b8b4568","authors":["S Sans","P Elliott","I Kleinschmidt","G Shaddick","S Pattenden","P Walls","C Grundy","H Dolk"],"doi":"10.1136\/oem.52.4.217","first_seen_on":"2017-05-14T08:13:16+00:00","issns":["1351-0711","1470-7926"],"issue":"4","journal":"Occupational and environmental medicine","last_mentioned_on":1388534400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/oem.52.4.217"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/oem.bmj.com\/content\/oemed\/52\/4\/217.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1128198","pmid":"7795735","pubdate":"1995-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","startpage":"217","subjects":["environmentalhealth","occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Cancer incidence and mortality near the Baglan Bay petrochemical works, South Wales.","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cancer-incidence-mortality-near-baglan-bay-petrochemical-works-south-wales"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8094378,"mean":6.8925303985645,"rank":2041412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4955069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8094378,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233608,"mean":12.256214736716,"rank":77086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":154438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233608,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2741,"mean":8.2584124087591,"rank":882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2741,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":26.763794871795,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
