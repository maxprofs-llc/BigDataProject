In pigs, corresponding observations are recorded using automatic feeding stations and serve as one of the main criteria in most pig selection programmes. Simultaneously, feeding stations also generate feeding behaviour data which represent a nearly unused resource and provide a valuable proxy measure of health status, animal welfare, and management practices. In the current study, an integrated approach was applied to a feed efficiency tested and genome-wide genotyped terminal sire line population. Therefore, genetic analyses were performed combining a single-marker based approach and a Bayesian multi-marker algorithm. Major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for feeding behaviour traits comprising daily occupation time, daily feeder visit, and daily feeding rate were identified on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 14. Feed efficiency was represented by feed conversion ratio and daily feed intake revealing prominent genomic regions on chromosomes 1, 6, 9, and 11. The positional and functional candidate genes identified are involved in transport processes like AQP4, SLC22A23, and SLC6A14 as well as energy sensing, generation, and utilization as exemplified by PPP3CA, IQGAP3, ECI2, and DnaJC15. These molecular features provide the first step towards the dissection of the genetic connection between distinct feeding behaviour patterns, feed efficiency and performance, health, and welfare traits driving the implementation of these traits in breeding programmes and pig husbandry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037bf","authors":["Reyer, Henry","Shirali, Mahmoud","Ponsuksili, Siriluck","Murani, Eduard","Varley, Patrick F.","Jensen, Just","Wimmers, Klaus"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00438-017-1325-1","first_seen_on":"2017-05-14T10:20:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1617-4615","1617-4623"],"journal":"Molecular Genetics & Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1494776950,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28500374?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28500374","pubdate":"2017-05-14T22:01:51+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Exploring the genetics of feed efficiency and feeding behaviour traits in a pig line highly selected for performance characteristics","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-genetics-feed-efficiency-feeding-behaviour-traits-pig-line-highly-selected-performance-cha"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":3758143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4364398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238430,"mean":12.366368436725,"rank":105038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":129385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238430,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":503,"mean":2.4292231075697,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":503,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.4259259259259,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
