Our study aimed to assess if the presence of power Doppler (PD) can be predicted by a combination of clinical, laboratory and US parameters. We conducted a real-life, retrospective cohort study comparing clinical, laboratory and US parameters of 108 patients with established RA and 93 patients with S-IA. We propose a PD signal prediction model based on a beta-binomial distribution for PD variable using a mix of outcome measures. Patients with RA in clinical remission had significantly more active inflammation and erosions on US when compared with patients with S-IA with similar disease scores (p\u2009=\u20090.03 and p\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively); however, RA patients with different disease activity score (DAS-28) scores had similar PD scores (p\u2009=\u20090.058). The PD scores did not correlate with erosions (p\u2009=\u20090.38) or DAS-28 scores (p\u2009=\u20090.28) in RA patients, but they correlated with high disease activity in S-IA patients (p\u2009=\u20090.048). Subclinical inflammation is more common in patients with RA in clinical remission or with low disease activity than in patients with S-IA; therefore, US was more useful in assessing for true remission in RA rather than diagnosing IA in patients with low disease activity scores. This is the first study to propose a PD prediction model integrating several outcome measures in the two different groups of patients. Further research into validating this model can minimise the risk of underdiagnosing subclinical inflammation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002579","authors":["Coziana Ciurtin","Karol Wyszynski","Robert Clarke","Maria Mouyis","Jessica Manson","Giampiero Marra","Ciurtin, C","Wyszynski, K","Clarke, R","Mouyis, M","Manson, J","Marra, G"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10067-016-3326-6","first_seen_on":"2017-05-14T12:36:03+00:00","issns":["0770-3198","1434-9949"],"journal":"Clinical Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1502443984,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10067-016-3326-6","http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1518735\/"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10067-016-3326-6.pdf","pmid":"27325125","pubdate":"2016-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer London","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Ultrasound-detected subclinical inflammation was better reflected by the disease activity score (DAS-28) in patients with suspicion of inflammatory arthritis compared to established rheumatoid arthritis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrasounddetected-subclinical-inflammation-better-reflected-disease-activity-score-das28-patients-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":4211990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3928490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246782,"mean":12.514102090517,"rank":124574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":111865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246782,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1035,"mean":4.3244100580271,"rank":541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1035,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.5837209302326,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
