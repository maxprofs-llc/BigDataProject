Within odour mixtures, such information is contained in the odours of specific elements or in the mixture configuration perceived as a whole unique odour. For instance, an AB mixture of the element A (ethyl isobutyrate) and the element B (ethyl maltol) generates a configural AB percept in humans and apparently in another species, the rabbit. Here, we examined whether the memory of such a configuration is distinct from the memory of the individual odorants. Taking advantage of the newborn rabbit's ability to learn odour mixtures, we combined behavioural and pharmacological tools to specifically eliminate elemental memory of A and B after conditioning to the AB mixture and evaluate consequences on configural memory of AB. The amnesic treatment suppressed responsiveness to A and B but not to AB. Two other experiments confirmed the specific perception and particular memory of the AB mixture. These data demonstrate the existence of configurations in certain odour mixtures and their representation as unique objects: after learning, animals form a configural memory of these mixtures, which coexists with, but is relatively dissociated from, memory of their elements. This capability emerges very early in life.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a3","authors":["G\u00e9rard Coureaud","Thierry Thomas-Danguin","Donald A Wilson","Guillaume Ferreira"],"doi":"10.1098\/rspb.2013.3319","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T10:47:21+00:00","issns":["0962-8452"],"journal":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1421139314,"links":["http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/263745821_Neonatal_representation_of_odour_objects_distinct_memories_of_the_whole_and_its_parts"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Gerard_Coureaud\/publication\/263745821_Neonatal_representation_of_odour_objects_distinct_memories_of_the_whole_and_its_parts\/links\/0046353c0ecf32f50e000000.pdf?ev=pub_ext_doc_dl_meta","pmid":"24990670","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Neonatal representation of odour objects: distinct memories of the whole and its parts.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neonatal-representation-odour-objects-distinct-memories-whole-parts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4728801,"mean":5.5894221182644,"rank":3255747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":879064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4728801,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160123,"mean":8.9158536740736,"rank":110984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":32024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160123,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4355,"mean":18.602802480478,"rank":4023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4355,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":41.74675,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
