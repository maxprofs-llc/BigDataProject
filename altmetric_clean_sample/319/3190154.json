Bacteriocins interacted selectively with malignant, and not with normal, lymphocytes causing cell cycle perturbation which was rapidly and objectively recorded by the flowcytometer. The patients were grouped as: (A) newly-diagnosed (15); (B) early induction (11); (C) remission with viral infection (7); (D) remission (64); (E) bone marrow relapsed (5); (F) extramedullary relapsed (3); (G) non-malignant pediatric controls (8). Bacteriocin reacted usually with groups A, B, C, E and not with groups D, F and G. Repeated testing correlated well with the clinical status. Blood from 7 patients in remission and from 3 normal individuals, each with transient viral infection, reacted with bacteriocin. A quantitative correlation between peripheral blood blasts or surface markers for ALL and bacteriocin reactivity was not established. Unexpected results were obtained only in 13% (false-positive 11% and false-negative 3%). This test can be recommended for preliminary diagnosis and possibly prognosis of lymphoblastic leukemia and provides means of monitoring progress during chemotherapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000733c","authors":["C E Musclow","H Farkas-Himsley","S S Weitzman","M Herridge"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T09:52:15+00:00","issns":["0277-5379"],"issue":"4","journal":"European Journal of Cancer and Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1199827673,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3475205"],"pmid":"3475205","pubdate":"1987-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia of childhood monitored by bacteriocin and flowcytometry.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-childhood-monitored-bacteriocin-flowcytometry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":816028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95300,"mean":8.1249274179165,"rank":24903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95300,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.2619047619048,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Bacteriocin","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=183033072#altmetric_citation_7","license":"public","citation_ids":[3190151,3190154],"posted_on":"2008-01-08T21:27:53+00:00","summary":"Bacteriocins are proteinaceous toxins produced by bacteria to inhibit the growth of similar or closely related bacterial strain(s).","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=63790","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Bckirkup","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Bckirkup"}}]}}
