Proust modelled the character of Cottard on the real-life Parisian neurologist and psychiatrist Dr Jules Cotard (1840-1889). Marcel Proust's father, Dr Adrien Proust, was an eminent Parisian surgeon and a contemporary of Cotard. A review of the biographical literature (in French) relating to Dr Jules Cotard and an analysis of his published work (in English and French) have revealed a striking parallelism between the lives of the fictional Cottard and Jules Cotard.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001cf7","authors":["John Pearn","Christopher Gardner-Thorpe"],"doi":"10.1177\/096777200301100212","first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T12:47:58+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0967-7720"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Medical Biography","last_mentioned_on":1238703591,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12717539"],"pmid":"12717539","pubdate":"2003-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Historical Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","historyofmedicine"],"title":"A biographical note on Marcel Proust's Professor Cottard.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biographical-note-marcel-prousts-professor-cottard"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":816189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292067,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95161,"mean":8.1238521017237,"rank":24836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95161,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":3.2268701298701,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Jules Cotard","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=281358127#altmetric_citation_3","license":"public","citation_ids":[3196937],"posted_on":"2009-04-02T20:19:51+00:00","summary":"Jules Cotard (1 June 1840 in Issoudun, Indre &ndash; 19 August 1889) was a French neurologist who is best known for first describing the Cotard delusion, a patient's delusional belief that they are dead, do not exist or do not have bodily organs.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=256691","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Plindenbaum","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Plindenbaum"}}]}}
