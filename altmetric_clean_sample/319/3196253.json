P. Yonelinas, N. E. A. Kroll, I. Dobbins, M. Lazzara, and R. T. Knight (1998) to study the states of awareness accompanying recognition of affective images and the processes of recollection and familiarity that may underlie them. Results from all experiments showed that (a) negative stimuli tended to be remembered, whereas positive stimuli tended to be known; (b) recollection, but not familiarity, was boosted for negative or highly arousing and, to a lesser extent, positive stimuli; and (c) across experiments, variations in depth of encoding did not influence these patterns. These data suggest that greater recollection for affective events leads them to be more richly experienced in memory, and they are consistent with the idea that the states of remembering and knowing are experientially exclusive, whereas the processes underlying them are functionally independent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002d9b","authors":["K N Ochsner"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T12:29:43+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0096-3445"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Experimental Psychology.
