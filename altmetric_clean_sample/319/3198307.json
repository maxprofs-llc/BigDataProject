Nearly 100% of MEN2A are associated with germ line mutation of the RET proto-oncogene (RET), and DNA-based RET genotype analysis is now considered essential for earlier diagnosis. The first manifestation of MEN2A is most often due to MTC, and less frequently to Pheo. Rarely, MEN2A is recognized during the search for PHT associated conditions. Most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic, and the focus of the presentation may be the side effects of chronic hypercalcemia, osteoporosis, renal lithiasis, peptic ulcer disease, and hypertension. Hypercalcemic pancreatitis is rare, being an uncommon first manifestation of PHT. Here, we report on a patient who presented recurrent pancreatitis as the first manifestation of MEN2A. In the present case, prompt sequential dosage of calcium, diagnosis of PHT, and genetic analysis would have resulted in pancreatitis prevention and early MEN2A management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Dora JM","Siqueira DR","Meyer EL","Pu\u00f1ales MK","Maia AL"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T13:28:22+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"8","journal":"Arquivos Brasileiros de Endocrinologia e Metabologia","last_mentioned_on":1275745292,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19169490"],"pmid":"19169490","pubdate":"2009-01-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Pancreatitis as the first manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A.","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pancreatitis-first-manifestation-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630112,"mean":4.9307700568987,"rank":816213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630112,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95084,"mean":8.1120737460958,"rank":24789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95084,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":381,"mean":1.1614894736842,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":381,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=366193457#altmetric_citation_10","license":"public","citation_ids":[3198306,3198307],"posted_on":"2010-06-05T13:41:32+00:00","summary":"The term multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) encompasses several distinct syndromes featuring tumors of endocrine glands, each with its own characteristic pattern.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=277098","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m"}}]}}
