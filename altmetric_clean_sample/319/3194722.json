The extrapolation of animal assays to human use requires caution, since synergism with oestrogens, which is usually necessary, shows widely-differing species-specific ratios. In other ratios, progestogens are often antagonistic to oestrogens.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003370","authors":["F Neumann","Neumann, F"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T11:47:34+00:00","issns":["0032-5473"],"journal":"Postgraduate Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1482862678,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/368741","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/368741"],"pmid":"368741","pubdate":"1978-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The physiological action of progesterone and the pharmacological effects of progestogens--a short review.","type":"article","volume":"54 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physiological-action-progesterone-pharmacological-effects-progestogensa-short-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7942916,"mean":6.7127945609325,"rank":1959586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4892285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7942916,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238778,"mean":8.1006740682729,"rank":67401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":165952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238778,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1452,"mean":7.801066850448,"rank":475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1452,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":8.1929166666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Megestrol acetate","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=494988684#altmetric_citation_4","license":"public","citation_ids":[3194722],"posted_on":"2012-05-29T18:04:37+00:00","summary":"Megestrol acetate (INN, USAN, BAN, JAN) (abbreviated as MGA or MA, and sold mainly under the brand names Megace and Megace ES), also known as 17\u03b1-acetoxy-6-dehydro-6-methylprogesterone, is a steroidal progestin and progesterone derivative (specifically, a","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=6657950","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Vanished 45kd09la13","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Vanished 45kd09la13"}},{"title":"Progestin","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=724835929#altmetric_citation_8d2a11e5-7fbb-499d-99a8-5d919f6af0d9","license":"public","citation_ids":[3194722],"posted_on":"2016-06-11T20:43:06+00:00","summary":"Progestins are synthetic progestogens that have progestogenic effects similar to those of progesterone.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=239990","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Medgirl131","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Medgirl131"}},{"title":"Antiandrogen","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=756926099#altmetric_citation_a67e8379-1ec2-4455-9f73-8093ea56d3f5","license":"public","citation_ids":[3194722],"posted_on":"2016-12-27T18:17:58+00:00","summary":"Antiandrogens, also known as androgen antagonists or testosterone blockers, are a class of drugs which prevent androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from mediating their biological effects in the body.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=179978","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Medgirl131","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Medgirl131"}}]}}
