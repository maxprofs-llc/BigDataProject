Packed cell volume, total and differential white blood cell counts, and blood smears were obtained. Blood smears from 75 terns were examined. No hemoparasites were found. There were some significant differences among hematologic parameters in birds from different islands, and between birds nesting earlier versus later in the season, but there were no significant differences associated with body mass, sex, or age. The absence of hemoparasites in the blood smears of these terns is noteworthy, especially because other studies of seabirds (including Charadriiformes) have revealed low prevalences of hematozoa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f36","authors":["Fiorello CV","Nisbet IC","Hatch JJ","Corsiglia C","Pokras MA"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T11:44:54+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1327933987,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19746853"],"pmid":"19746853","pubdate":"2009-09-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Hematology and absence of hemoparasites in breeding common terns (Sterna hirundo) from Cape Cod, Massachusetts.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hematology-absence-hemoparasites-breeding-common-terns-isterna-hirundoi-cape-cod-massachusetts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627924,"mean":4.9449041432285,"rank":817357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627924,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94698,"mean":8.0641417362748,"rank":24637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94698,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214,"mean":2.2289765258216,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.190625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
