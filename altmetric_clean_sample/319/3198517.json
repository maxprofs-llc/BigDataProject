Methods were introduced to measure spatial orientation in tasks in a group of fourteen autistic children in Montreal, Canada. Ambient lenses were found to improve posture, correct head tilts, and improve ball catching abilities. A model of spatial orientation is described and recommendations are made to incorporate ambient lenses in treatment programs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002506","authors":["M Kaplan","D P Carmody","A Gaydos","Kaplan, M","Carmody, D P","Gaydos, A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T13:34:13+00:00","issns":["0009-398X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Child Psychiatry & Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1473743457,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8936794","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8936794"],"pmid":"8936794","pubdate":"1996-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Postural orientation modifications in autism in response to ambient lenses.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postural-orientation-modifications-autism-response-ambient-lenses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":2146958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5082659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243050,"mean":8.2641161494185,"rank":69744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":167334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243050,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":403,"mean":4.3787611940299,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":403,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
