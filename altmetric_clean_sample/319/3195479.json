The objective of palliative sedation is to relieve severe physical or psychological suffering that is otherwise untreatable. Sedation is used in 12% of all patients dying in the Netherlands. Refractory delirium, dyspnoea or pain are the most common indications. If deep palliative sedation is used, the estimated life expectancy should be a few days to at most one week. Midazolam is used most often for continuous sedation, usually by subcutaneous infusion; if the response is insufficient, a combination of midazolam with levomepromazine or phenobarbital or monotreatment with propofol may be used. If continuous infusion is not desired or feasible, intermittent administration of midazolam, diazepam, lorazepam or chlorpromazine may be considered. Provided that it is used under the right circumstances, palliative sedation does not shorten life.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000826e","authors":["Verhagen EH","Hesselmann GM","Besse TC","de Graeff A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-31T12:07:06+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"9","journal":"Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde","last_mentioned_on":1270749404,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15771339"],"pmid":"15771339","pubdate":"2005-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Palliative sedation].","type":"article","volume":"149","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/palliative-sedation-12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":816121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95217,"mean":8.1255184842886,"rank":24860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95217,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":345,"mean":1.7031279069767,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":345,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.9,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Lorazepam","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=354787334#altmetric_citation_56","license":"public","citation_ids":[3195479],"posted_on":"2010-04-08T17:56:44+00:00","summary":"Lorazepam (trademarked as Ativan or Orfidal) is a high-potency, intermediate-duration, 3-hydroxy benzodiazepine drug, often used to treat anxiety disorders.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=244115","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Literaturegeek","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Literaturegeek"}}]}}
