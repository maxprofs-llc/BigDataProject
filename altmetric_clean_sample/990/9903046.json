Systemic plant immunity develops after foliar infection by microbial pathogens, upon root colonization by certain microbes, or in response to physical injury. The systemic plant immune response to localized foliar infection is associated with elevated levels of pattern-recognition receptors, accumulation of dormant signaling enzymes, and alterations in chromatin state. Together, these systemic responses provide a memory to the initial infection by priming the remote leaves for enhanced defense and immunity to reinfection. The plant innate immune system thus builds immunological memory by utilizing mechanisms and components that are similar to those employed in the trained innate immune response of jawed vertebrates. Therefore, there seems to be conservation, or convergence, in the evolution of innate immune memory in plants and vertebrates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f61000350b","authors":["Reimer-Michalski, Eva-Maria","Conrath, Uwe"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.smim.2016.05.006","first_seen_on":"2016-07-20T18:27:56+00:00","issns":["1096-3618","10445323"],"journal":"Seminars in Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1469039004,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27264335"],"pmid":"27264335","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Innate immune memory in plants","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/innate-immune-memory-plants-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085102,"mean":6.8782317593723,"rank":3798976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4106231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085102,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257817,"mean":11.979394451857,"rank":119091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":130318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257817,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263,"mean":5.0675038167939,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.04,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
