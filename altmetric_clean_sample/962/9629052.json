However, the 3-dimensional ground reaction forces used to perform rotational jumping tasks are currently unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare bilateral, 3-dimensional, ground reaction forces of a standard countermovement jump (CMJ0) to a countermovement jump with a 180\u00b0 rotation (CMJ180) among Division 1 soccer players. Twenty-four participants from the university's soccer team performed 3 trials of the CMJ0 and the CMJ180. Dependent variables included jump height, downward and upward phase times, vertical (Fz) peak force and net impulse relative to mass, and medial-lateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) force couple values. Statistical significance was set a priori at \u03b1 = 0.05. CMJ180 reduced jump height, increased the AP force couple in the downward and upward phases, and increased upward peak Fz (p<0.05). All other variables were not significantly different between groups (p>0.05). However, we did recognize downward peak Fz trended lower in the CMJ0 condition (p=0.059), and upward net impulse trended higher in the CMJ0 condition (p=0.071). It was concluded jump height was reduced during the rotational jumping task, and rotation occurred primarily via AP ground reaction forces through the entire countermovement jump. Coaches and athletes may consider additional rotational jumping in their training programs to mediate performance decrements during rotational jump tasks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Barker, Leland A.","Harry, John R.","Dufek, Janet S.","Mercer, John A."],"doi":"10.1519\/jsc.0000000000001557","first_seen_on":"2016-07-12T14:20:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1064-8011","1533-4287"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1490633302,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&issue=00000&article=96387&type=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Abstract\/2017\/04000\/Aerial_Rotation_Effects_on_Vertical_Jump.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/9000\/00000\/Aerial_Rotation_Effects_on_Vertical_Jump.96387.pdf","pmid":"27398922","pubdate":"2016-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Aerial Rotation Effects on Vertical Jump Performance Among Highly Skilled Collegiate Soccer Players","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nsca-jscr\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Aerial_Rotation_Effects_on_Vertical_Jump.96387.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aerial-rotation-effects-vertical-jump-performance-among-highly-skilled-collegiate-soccer-players-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":4498586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2345647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261626,"mean":11.789526390826,"rank":141843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":94928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261626,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3918,"mean":16.271743170794,"rank":3218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3918,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":16.584515463918,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
