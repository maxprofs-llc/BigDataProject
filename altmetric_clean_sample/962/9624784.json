Modified solvent emulsification-evaporation method was optimized to obtain Tmx-PLN, composed of chitosan and lecithin, of 169.66 \u00b1 4.84 nm particle size. The PLN exhibited prolonged in vitro release in phosphate-buffered saline. Further, PLN displayed enhanced oral bioavailability with considerable increase in AUC (1277.46 vs. 585.01 ng\/ml \u00b7 h), pro- longed t\u00bd (27.87 \u00b1 15.62 vs. 10.18 \u00b1 6.5 h) and mean residence time (40.11 \u00b1 25.72 vs. 17.42 \u00b1 12.04 h) in comparison to pure Tmx. In addition, PLN exhibited significantly increased (P < 0.05) antitumor efficacy in DMBA-induced breast cancer model, when administered once in three days in comparison to Tmx daily dosing. This enhancement may be attributed to a probable reduction in Pgp efflux, decreased first-pass metabolism and lymphatic drug transport. Thus, Tmx-PLN exhibited enhanced potential to increase Tmx therapeutic efficacy in chronic treatment of breast cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d84","authors":["Varthya, Mansingh","Pawar, Harish","Singh, Charan","Dora, Chander Parkash","Jena, Sunil Kumar","Suresh, Sarasija"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-12T10:20:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-4880"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1468318812,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27398452?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27398452","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Development of Novel Polymer-Lipid Hybrid Nanoparticles of Tamoxifen: In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluation.","type":"article","volume":"16"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069135,"mean":6.8476973499224,"rank":6987576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069135,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258753,"mean":11.688067230398,"rank":217876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258753,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":419,"mean":1.3386267942584,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":419,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.61666666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/752809776950587393","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9624784],"posted_on":"2016-07-12T10:20:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"752809776950587393"}]}}
