Most immigrant (76.1%) and Portuguese mothers (80.0%) agreed to participate and with the visits, thus a total of 89 immigrants and 188 Portuguese women were included in the study. The questionnaire included the application of four validated scales: Mental Health Inventory-5, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Scale of Satisfaction with Social Support. Statistical analysis included t-test and Chi-square or Fisher's test, and logistic regression models.\nImmigrants had an increased risk of postpartum depression (OR = 6.444, 95%CI 1.858-22.344), and of low satisfaction with social support (OR = 6.118, 95%CI 1.991-18.798). We did not perceive any associations between migrant state, perceived stress, and impoverished mental health.\nImmigrant mothers have increased vulnerabilities in the postpartum period, resulting in an increased risk of postpartum depression and lesser satisfaction with the received social support.","authors":["Almeida, L\u00edgia Moreira","Costa-Santos, Cristina","Caldas, Jos\u00e9 Peixoto","Dias, S\u00f3nia","Ayres-de-Campos, Diogo","Almeida, L\u00edgia Moreira","Costa-Santos, Cristina","Caldas, Jos\u00e9 Peixoto","Dias, S\u00f3nia","Ayres-de-Campos, Diogo"],"doi":"10.1590\/s1518-8787.2016050005617","first_seen_on":"2016-07-12T11:18:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1518-8787","0034-8910"],"journal":"Revista de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica","last_mentioned_on":1467903643,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1590\/S1518-8787.2016050005617"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/pdf\/rsp\/v50\/0034-8910-rsp-S1518-87872016050005617.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4917335","pmid":"27355463","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Faculdade de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"The impact of migration on women&#8217;s mental health in the postpartum period","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-migration-womens-mental-health-postpartum-period-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
