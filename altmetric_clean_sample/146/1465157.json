A 57-year-old man with SIT presented with change in bowel habits and rectal bleeding.Colonoscopy and abdomino-pelvic CT scan confirmed a constricting sigmoid lesion with normal tumor-marker levels. In our department the elective laparoscopic colon resection with lymphadenectomy is the preferred alternative of open surgery and is the chosen method in about 60 percent of cases. This is the first documented case report in Hungarian of a laparoscopically resected sigmoid tumour in a patient with SIT. We believe that with appropriate knowledge of anatomy and advanced routine in laparoscopic surgery laparoscopic resection can be a safe method even in a special case like this one was.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa80e3cf058f61000bb11","authors":["Berencsi A","Bezsilla J","Sikorszki L","Temesi R","Bende S"],"doi":"10.1556\/maseb.66.2013.1.5","first_seen_on":"2013-05-11T10:18:14+00:00","issns":["0025-0295"],"issue":"1","journal":"Magyar Sebszet","last_mentioned_on":1368267304,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23428726?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23428726","pubdate":"2013-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"[Laparoscopic sigmoid resection in total situs inversus].","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laparoscopos-sigmaresectio-situs-inversus-totalisban"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":2906111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84804,"mean":6.8639079985379,"rank":66351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84804,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.23863636363636,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/333163337439383555","license":"public","citation_ids":[1465157],"posted_on":"2013-05-11T10:15:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"333163337439383555"}]}}
