Forty-one children at The Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and controls were included in the study. The main findings were: No significant difference in the decayed, missing and filled surfaces of the primary and permanent teeth between the phenylketonuria children and the controls. A significantly greater mean plaque score for the control children compared with the phenylketonuria children (p < 0.01) for the permanent teeth only. A significantly greater number of white opacities in the permanent teeth of the phenylketonuria group compared with the control group (p < 0.02). No significant differences in the caries related microflora.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005741","authors":["Lucas, V S","Contreras, A","Loukissa, M","Roberts, G J"],"first_seen_on":"2013-05-10T14:39:15+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1945-1954"],"issue":"4","journal":"ASDC Journal of Dentistry for Children","last_mentioned_on":1368196183,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11862879"],"pmid":"11862879","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","pediatrics"],"title":"Dental disease indices and caries related oral microflora in children with phenylketonuria.","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dental-disease-indices-caries-related-oral-microflora-children-phenylketonuria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636264,"mean":4.9211313967159,"rank":2018652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636264,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84886,"mean":6.8388267420629,"rank":43979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":25306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84886,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.7484516129032,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
