In this paper, a case of an odontogenic lesion characterized by simultaneous occurrence of areas of calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC) and orthokeratinized odontogenic cyst (OOC) is described. The lesion was asymptomatic and presented at the radiographic examination as a unilocular well-delimited radiolucency extending from left incisor to right premolar area in the mandible. To date, this is the first report of COC associated with an OOC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f6100075e0","authors":["Vanessa de F\u00e1tima Bernardes","J\u00falio C\u00e9sar Tanos de Lacerda","Maria C\u00e1ssia Ferreira de Aguiar","Ricardo Santiago Gomez"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12105-008-0072-3","first_seen_on":"2013-05-12T21:48:35+00:00","issns":["1936-055X","1936-0568"],"issue":"4","journal":"Head and Neck Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1368395107,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2807583\/"],"pmid":"20614303","pubdate":"2008-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Otorhinolaryngology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"324","subjects":["neoplasms","pathology"],"title":"Calcifying Odontogenic Cyst Associated with an Orthokeratinized Odontogenic Cyst","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calcifying-odontogenic-cyst-associated-orthokeratinized-odontogenic-cyst"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88648,"mean":7.0918266833622,"rank":60002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":17805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88648,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":0.90129032258065,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
