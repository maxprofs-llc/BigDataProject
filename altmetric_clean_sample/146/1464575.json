This review describes potential etiological factors of PCOS with the aim to support potential mechanism of action of acupuncture to relieve PCOS related symptoms. The theory that increased sympathetic activity contributes to the development and maintenance of PCOS is presented, and that the effects of acupuncture are, at least in part, mediated by modulation of sympathetic outflow. While there are no relevant randomized controlled studies on the use of acupuncture to treat metabolic abnormalities in women with PCOS, a number of experimental studies indicate that acupuncture may improve metabolic dysfunction. For each aspect of PCOS, it is important to pursue new treatment strategies that have fewer negative side effects than drug treatments, as women with PCOS often require prolonged treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310e","authors":["Stener-Victorin E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mce.2013.01.006","first_seen_on":"2013-05-10T22:43:35+00:00","issns":["03037207","0303-7207"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Molecular & Cellular Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1400592919,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0303720713000294","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0303720713000294?via=ihub","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.mce.2013.01.006","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23416841"],"pmid":"23416841","pubdate":"2013-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ireland Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","endocrinology"],"title":"Hypothetical Physiological and Molecular Basis for the Effect of Acupuncture in the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"373","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypothetical-physiological-molecular-basis-effect-acupuncture-treatment-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5425933,"mean":6.317631448385,"rank":865438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":4558219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5425933,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95419,"mean":7.2968324215557,"rank":16855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":78498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95419,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":906,"mean":2.5970011049724,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":906,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.2833333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
