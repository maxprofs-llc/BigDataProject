Solid-state structure determination of 2a revealed the 3D network structure through intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxy group of the p-hydroxybenzoate ligand and the oxygen atom of the carboxylate ligand of 2a. UV-vis analysis of 2a\u2013c in CH3CN or CH3CN\u2013H2O in the presence of \u03b3-Al2O3 clearly indicated the adsorption efficiency of these platinum clusters on \u03b3-Al2O3: 2a bearing a hydroxyl group and 2b bearing a B(OH)2 group were effectively deposited onto \u03b3-Al2O3 from CH3CN solution, whereas less than 40% of 1 and 2c were chemically adsorbed onto \u03b3-Al2O3. Highly dispersed and very small platinum nanoparticles (less than 1 nm) on \u03b3-Al2O3 were obtained by thermal treatment of Pt4-deposited \u03b3-Al2O3 at 500 \u00b0C.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Shinji Tanaka","Naoto Nagata","Naoki Tagawa","Hirohito Hirata","Shin-ichi Matsumoto","Hayato Tsurugi","Kazushi Mashima"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3dt50670c","first_seen_on":"2013-05-09T12:06:11+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"35","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1376392847,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/C3DT50670C"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/dt\/c3dt50670c","pmid":"23657420","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"12662","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Tetraplatinum cluster complexes bearing hydrophilic anchors as precursors for \u00ce\u00b3-Al2O3-supported platinum nanoparticles","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tetraplatinum-cluster-complexes-bearing-hydrophilic-anchors-precursors-%CE%B3al2o3supported-platinum-nano"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3555190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88752,"mean":7.1039675045916,"rank":70926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88752,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":0.95300375751503,"rank":4648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/367244337953771520","license":"public","citation_ids":[1460067],"posted_on":"2013-08-13T11:20:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"367244337953771520"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/332465738709336064","license":"public","citation_ids":[1460067],"posted_on":"2013-05-09T12:03:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"332465738709336064"}]}}
