Whereas the deep sea record of global climatic change provides indirect evidence for an increase in C(4) vegetation with a shift towards a cooler, drier and more variable global climatic regime beginning approximately 3 million years ago (Ma), evidence for grassland-dominated ecosystems in continental Africa and hominin activities within such ecosystems have been lacking.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009PLoSO...4.7199P","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Thomas W.
