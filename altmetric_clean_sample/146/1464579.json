The signs and symptoms of testicular torsion may easily be mistakenly attributed to preceding testicular trauma if there was such an event. A patient is described with trauma induced testicular torsion who presented on three occasions before a decision was made to perform scrotal exploration. Unfortunately, an orchidectomy was the outcome. The message that trauma can and not infrequently does precipitate torsion, needs to be reiterated. Awareness of the entity and constant vigilance is required of clinicians to avoid a delay in definitive treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059e8","authors":["Yeap Joo Seng","Kevin Moissinac"],"doi":"10.1136\/emj.17.5.381","first_seen_on":"2013-05-10T22:47:59+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1472-0213","1351-0622"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Accident and Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1368225877,"links":["http:\/\/emj.bmj.com\/content\/17\/5\/381.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/emj.bmj.com\/content\/17\/5\/381.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1725459","pmid":"11005420","pubdate":"2000-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and the British Association for Accident & Emergency Medicine","startpage":"381","subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Trauma induced testicular torsion: a reminder for the unwary","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trauma-induced-testicular-torsion-reminder-unwary"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88780,"mean":7.0869665574067,"rank":60136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":17793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88780,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":4.0452727272727,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Social Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Vilsjin\/statuses\/332989579554615299","license":"public","citation_ids":[1464579],"posted_on":"2013-05-10T22:44:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Jonas Vils","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/739049499792801792\/qF-x7IkC_normal.jpg","description":"Ser ut som folk g\u00f6r mest men pratar om helt andra saker.
