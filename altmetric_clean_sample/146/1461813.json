Recently, neuronal intrinsic plasticity (IP) has become a hot topic in this area. IP is sometimes thought to be an information-maximization mechanism. However, it is still unclear how IP affects the performance of artificial neural networks in supervised learning applications. From an information-theoretical perspective, the error-entropy minimization (MEE) algorithm has newly been proposed as an efficient training method. In this study, we propose a synergistic learning algorithm combining the MEE algorithm as the synaptic plasticity rule and an information-maximization algorithm as the intrinsic plasticity rule. We consider both feedforward and recurrent neural networks and study the interactions between intrinsic and synaptic plasticity. Simulations indicate that the intrinsic plasticity rule can improve the performance of artificial neural networks trained by the MEE algorithm.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yuke Li","Chunguang Li"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0062894","first_seen_on":"2013-05-10T00:45:36+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1368146536,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0062894"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0062894.pdf","pmid":"23671642","pubdate":"2013-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e62894","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Synergies between Intrinsic and Synaptic Plasticity Based on Information Theoretic Learning","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synergies-between-intrinsic-synaptic-plasticity-based-information-theoretic-learning"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3555195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88779,"mean":7.0870362477192,"rank":70983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88779,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80037,"mean":8.3320977809987,"rank":64287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80037,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4094,"mean":8.8227520156365,"rank":3272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4094,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
