Therefore, the pharmacokinetic properties of the CA possess a central role: iodinated x-ray CAs are small molecules that distribute rapidly within the extravascular extracellular space, whereas larger macromolecular compounds have a prolonged vascular phase and a restricted volume of distribution. The aim of this animal study was to compare the x-ray CA iopromide and the experimental gadolinium-based dendrimeric Gadomer in the assessment of early therapy response after a single dose of the novel multikinase inhibitor regorafenib.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a7a","doi":"10.1097\/rli.0b013e318290cafb","first_seen_on":"2013-05-12T11:24:38+00:00","issns":["0020-9996"],"issue":"","journal":"Investigative Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1378846944,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Dynamic_Contrast_Enhanced_Computed_Tomography_to.99518.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/Abstract\/2013\/10000\/Dynamic_Contrast_Enhanced_Computed_Tomography_to.5.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/9000\/00000\/Dynamic_Contrast_Enhanced_Computed_Tomography_to.99518.pdf","pmid":"23666093","pubdate":"2013-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography to Assess Antitumor Treatment Effects: Comparison of Two Contrast Agents With Different Pharmacokinetics","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamic-contrastenhanced-computed-tomography-assess-antitumor-treatment-effects-comparison-two-contr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2926678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1433342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88647,"mean":7.0919157096768,"rank":56687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":28644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88647,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":805,"mean":1.2224228855721,"rank":300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":805,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.6403076923077,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
