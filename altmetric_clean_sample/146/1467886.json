Investigators have identified many of the molecular mechanisms behind this technology in an attempt to optimize clinical results. In particular, activation of the wound healing response plays a key role in the remodeling of post-MDA treated skin, although this response varies based on the type of MDA employed.While many studies discuss the clinical applications of MDA and their relation to histologic changes found after treatment, few address the basic science behind the technology.Our review covers progress made in the last 10 years of research, with an emphasis on the molecular mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7053cf058f61000a4d4","authors":["Kirkland EB","Hantash BM"],"first_seen_on":"2013-05-12T21:29:39+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Drugs in Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1368393975,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23135666"],"pmid":"23135666","pubdate":"2012-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Microdermabrasion: molecular mechanisms unraveled, part 1.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microdermabrasion-molecular-mechanisms-unraveled-part-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":2899038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84677,"mean":6.8541816807598,"rank":66020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84677,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":1.7167875354108,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.4,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ducrest\/statuses\/333694637355180033","license":"public","citation_ids":[1467886],"posted_on":"2013-05-12T21:26:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Dominique du Crest","url":"http:\/\/www.skinaid.eu\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1474773419\/image_normal.jpg","description":"#Evidence as guiding star!Curating #skin science.
