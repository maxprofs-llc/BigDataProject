Males of this species are sexually promiscuous with females of other species; therefore, we asked in this study whether virgin C. remanei females display evidence of mate choice. We digitally recorded and measured the locomotor behaviors of one or more virgin females in the presence of a single male on a 5 mm diameter mating lawn. We observed that initially only the male modifies his locomotor trajectory to another animal on the mating lawn; the virgin females showed no locomotor bias toward the mate-searching male. However, once a male started to copulate, females in the vicinity altered their movement trajectories toward the copulating couple. Newly inseminated females are refractive to the coital signal, but partially regain their attraction to copulating males after 24 h. We found only copulating males with an intact gonad can attract females, and that the coital signal can be broadcasted at least 1.5 mm through the air. Unlike males, which are also attracted to hetero-specific females, virgin C. remanei females will only crawl toward a copulating con-specific male. We suggest that Caenorhabditis females use the coital signal as a pheromone to identify a vigorous male of their own species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"536246132a83ee225b8b4590","authors":["Mathew Markert","Luis Ren\u00e9 Garc\u00eda"],"doi":"10.4161\/worm.24448","first_seen_on":"2013-05-09T12:37:23+00:00","issns":["2162-4046"],"journal":"Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control, with Measurement + Control","last_mentioned_on":1371753922,"links":["http:\/\/www.landesbioscience.com\/journals\/worm\/article\/24448\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.landesbioscience.com\/journals\/worm\/2013WORM102R.pdf","pmid":"24058874","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","title":"Virgin Caenorhabditis remanei females are attracted to a coital pheromone released by con-specific copulating males","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/virgin-caenorhabditis-remanei-females-attracted-coital-pheromone-released-conspecific-copulating-mal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":2956990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1411977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88750,"mean":7.089787377886,"rank":57943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":28039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88750,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":401,"mean":1.56612,"rank":206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":401,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.2,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
