However, the molecular mechanisms of its development and progression remain unclear. Presently, we examined the expression profile of microRNAs (miRs) in canine oral MM tissues and paired normal oral mucosa tissues by using the microRNA-microarray assay and quantitative RT-PCR. Importantly, a decreased expression of miR-203 was significantly associated with a shorter survival time. Also, miR-203 and -205 were markedly down-regulated in canine and human MM cell lines tested. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of miR-205 had a significant inhibitory effect on the cell growth of canine and human melanoma cells tested by targeting erbb3. Our data suggest that miR-203 is a new prognostic factor in canine oral MMs and that miR-205 functions as a tumour suppressor by targeting erbb3 in both canine and human MM cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f6","authors":["Noguchi, S.","Mori, T.","Hoshino, Y.","Yamada, N.","Maruo, K.","Akao, Y."],"doi":"10.1002\/vco.306","endpage":"123","first_seen_on":"2013-05-10T02:51:18+00:00","issns":["1476-5829","1476-5810"],"issue":"2","journal":"Veterinary & Comparative Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1368168075,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/vco.306\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/vco.306\/pdf","pmid":"23638671","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"113","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MicroRNAs as tumour suppressors incanine and human melanoma cells andas a prognostic factor in canine melanomas","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/micrornas-tumour-suppressors-canine-human-melanoma-cells-prognostic-factor-canine-melanomas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8438448,"mean":7.0964078468385,"rank":6402973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1147028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8438448,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121831,"mean":7.0356371665437,"rank":80002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":23628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121831,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":425,"mean":1.9699905660377,"rank":321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":425,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.425,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
