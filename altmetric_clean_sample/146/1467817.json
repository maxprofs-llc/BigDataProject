The health care portion of gross domestic product reached 16.2 percent, up from 16.0 percent in 2006. Slower growth in 2007 was largely attributed to retail prescription drug spending and government administration. With the exception of prescription drugs, most other health care services grew at about the same rate as or faster than in 2006. Spending growth from private sources accelerated in 2007 as public spending slowed; however, public spending growth has continued to outpace private sources since 2002.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029ba","authors":["Micah Hartman","Anne Martin","Patricia McDonnell","Aaron Catlin","the National Health Expenditure Accounts Team"],"doi":"10.1377\/hlthaff.28.1.246","endpage":"261","first_seen_on":"2013-05-12T20:48:00+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1544-5208","0278-2715"],"issue":"1","journal":"Health Affairs","last_mentioned_on":1295913600,"links":["http:\/\/content.healthaffairs.org\/cgi\/reprint\/28\/1\/246","http:\/\/content.healthaffairs.org\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/28\/1\/246","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1377\/hlthaff.28.1.246","http:\/\/content.healthaffairs.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/28\/1\/246"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/content.healthaffairs.org\/content\/28\/1\/246.full.pdf","pmid":"19124877","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Project HOPE - The People-to-People Health Foundation,\n                    Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"246","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"title":"National Health Spending In 2007: Slower Drug Spending Contributes To Lowest Rate Of Overall Growth Since 1998","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/content.healthaffairs.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1377\/hlthaff.28.1.246","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/national-health-spending-2007-slower-drug-spending-contributes-lowest-rate-overall-growth-since-1998"},"altmetric_score":{"score":23.472,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":23.472},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8175898,"mean":6.9176420321768,"rank":362486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7813524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8175898,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120665,"mean":6.9805605151496,"rank":6181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":114484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120665,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4246,"mean":36.851697997644,"rank":1346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":2900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4246,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":42.64,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
