Stroke as a result of these injuries can have devastating consequences. Optimal screening criteria, diagnostic imaging, and therapy for BCVIs have not been elucidated. Our institution began to apply liberal screening criteria using a whole-body scanning protocol with multidetector computed tomographic (WB-MDCT) scans to diagnose these injuries. The purpose of this study is to describe a single institution's large experience in patients with BCVI in an effort to provide insight into the diagnosis and management of these injuries.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb22a83ee005f8b4573","doi":"10.1097\/ta.0b013e318142d146","first_seen_on":"2013-05-10T19:55:50+00:00","issns":["2163-0755"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, The","last_mentioned_on":1368215561,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/Abstract\/2009\/01000\/Blunt_Cerebrovascular_Injuries__Does_Treatment.17.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jtrauma\/2009\/01000\/Blunt_Cerebrovascular_Injuries__Does_Treatment.17.pdf","pmid":"19131816","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins (351 West Camden Street, Baltimore MD 21201-2436, United States)","startpage":"132","title":"Blunt Cerebrovascular Injuries: Does Treatment Always Matter?","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blunt-cerebrovascular-injuries-treatment-always-matter"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":3557708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":832378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93135,"mean":7.234579530569,"rank":62932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":16479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93135,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2031,"mean":5.0978078817734,"rank":1628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2031,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":5.2559207920792,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
