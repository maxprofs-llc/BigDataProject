This pilot study employs a novel, non-invasive instrument combining two techniques, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) for measurement of CBF and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for measurement of cerebral oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations, to monitor patients during head-of-bed lowering.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000427c","authors":["Meeri N.
