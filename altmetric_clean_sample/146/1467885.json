The classic form of CCD is characterized by delayed closure of the fontanels, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles and dental anomalies. Clinical reports suggest that a subset of patients with CCD have skeletal changes which mimic hypophosphatasia (HPP). Mutations in RUNX2 are detected in approximately 65% of cases of CCD, and microdeletions occur in 13%. We present clinical and radiological features in a 6-year-old child with severe CCD manifested by absence of the clavicles marked calvarial hypomineralization, osteoporosis and progressive kyphoscoliosis. HPP features included Bowdler spurs, severe osteopenia, and low alkaline phosphatase. Following negative mutation analysis of RUNX2, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarray was performed. The result revealed a microdeletion in RUNX2, disrupting the C-terminal part of the gene.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697d","authors":["Areeg H.
