The WHO will use these results to improve the clinical utility of the ICD classification of mental disorders through the current ICD-10 revision process. Participants indicated that the most important purposes of a classification are to facilitate communication among clinicians and to inform treatment and management. They overwhelmingly preferred a simpler system with 100 or fewer categories, and over two-thirds preferred flexible guidance to a strict criteria-based approach. Opinions were divided about how to incorporate severity and functional status, while most respondents were receptive to a system that incorporates a dimensional component. Significant minorities of psychiatrists in Latin America and Asia reported problems with the cross-cultural applicability of existing classifications. Overall, ratings of ease of use and goodness of fit for specific ICD-10 categories were fairly high, but several categories were described as having poor utility in clinical practice. This represents an important focus for the ICD revision, as does ensuring that the ICD-11 classification of mental disorders is acceptable to psychiatrists throughout the world.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bca4","authors":["M Reed G","Mendon\u00e7a Correia J","Esparza P","Saxena S","Maj M"],"first_seen_on":"2013-05-10T07:30:58+00:00","issns":["1723-8617"],"issue":"2","journal":"World Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1373140340,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21633689","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21633689"],"pmcid":"PMC3105474","pmid":"21633689","pubdate":"2011-06-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Italy","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"title":"The WPA-WHO Global Survey of Psychiatrists' Attitudes Towards Mental Disorders Classification.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wpawho-global-survey-psychiatrists-attitudes-towards-mental-disorders-classification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.858,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.858},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8031071,"mean":6.8088916774441,"rank":831838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7199405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8031071,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120059,"mean":6.9171944060371,"rank":13947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":106111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120059,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":537,"mean":13.240832089552,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":537,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.4666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
