Reference"],"citation":{"abstract":"The Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) is used to indicate the health status of particular populations, to help with service planning and to measure the impact of clinical and social interventions. Culture-specific data are required to calculate SF-36 norm-based scores. Currently, in the UK normative sources are nearly two decades old, Anglocentric and lack data on the older population. We draw on raw data from the Welsh Health Survey (2007) to provide population norms for the eight SF-36 dimensions for Wales and its regions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a98","authors":["Paul Nash"],"doi":"10.1093\/pubmed\/fdr006","first_seen_on":"2013-05-10T17:40:25+00:00","issns":["1741-3850"],"journal":"Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1369035456,"links":["http:\/\/jpubhealth.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/33\/4\/587.short?rss=1&ssource=mfr"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jpubhealth.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/33\/4\/587.full.pdf","pmid":"21307049","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Questionnaire: normative data for Wales","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/short-form-36-sf36-health-survey-questionnaire-normative-data-wales"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3556105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":833779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93191,"mean":7.2307191758774,"rank":62946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":16520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93191,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":890,"mean":6.7356467941507,"rank":672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":890,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.825,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
