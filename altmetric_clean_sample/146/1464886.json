In comparison to electrophilic synthesis, the no-carrier-added (NCA) nucleophilic method has several advantages. These include much higher available activity and specific activity. Recently, we have described an NCA enantioselective synthesis using a chiral phase-transfer catalyst. However, some chemicals were difficult to implement into a commercially available synthesizer, restricting access to this radiopharmaceutical to only a few PET centers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","doi":"10.2967\/jnumed.112.112284","first_seen_on":"2013-05-11T07:31:14+00:00","issns":["1535-5667"],"journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1368257283,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23658219?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23658219","pubdate":"2013-05-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Production at the Curie Level of No-Carrier-Added 6-18F-Fluoro-L-Dopa.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/production-curie-level-nocarrieradded-618ffluoroldopa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633425,"mean":4.921826751301,"rank":2897833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633425,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84895,"mean":6.8302251042478,"rank":66119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84895,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1269,"mean":2.3701719242902,"rank":772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1269,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":3.1152173913043,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
