Conservative approaches should be considered as first line treatment for such disorders. Prolotherapy with 25\u00a0% dextrose being injected into the posterior pericapsular tissues is one such treatment modality with favorable outcomes.\nTo study the efficacy of single injection of 25\u00a0% dextrose in pericapsular tissues in the management of hypermobility joint disorders of TMJ as first line treatment.\nWe have studied a total of 23 patients suffering from either chronic recurrent dislocation or subluxation of the TMJ who were treated with the single injection technique prolotherapy with 25\u00a0% dextrose into the pericapsular tissues along with auriculotemporal nerve block and found encouraging results.\nOverall success rate in our study was 91.3\u00a0% (21\/23) with a minimum follow up period of 13.9 months. Number of successfully treated patients requiring one injection was 7 (30.4\u00a0%), two injections was 8 (34.7\u00a0%) and requiring three injections was 6 (26.1\u00a0%). There were no permanent complications.\nHence the use of 25\u00a0% dextrose as a proliferant to treat hypermobilty disorders of the TMJ is recommended by us as a first line treatment option as it is safe, economical and an easy procedure associated with minimal morbidity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d45","authors":["S.
