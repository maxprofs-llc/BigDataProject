Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) using short reads has become the standard tool to study genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation. The goal of the present protocol is to enable readers to perform WGBS on both the wet lab and the computational side. We briefly outline important steps in bisulfite library preparation, then focus on the different aspects of DNA methylation analysis, from read mapping to identifying biologically relevant differential methylation between different samples.","aggregated_in":[19614171],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Hagmann, J\u00f6rg","Becker, Claude","J\u00f6rg Hagmann","Claude Becker"],"book":{"title":"Plant Genomics","isbns":["9781493970018","9781493970032"],"uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/book\/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-7003-2"},"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-7003-2_5","editors":["Wolfgang Busch"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-26T10:17:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1064-3745","1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1493217119,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28439857?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007\/978-1-4939-7003-2_5"],"ordinal_number":5,"pmid":"28439857","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer New York","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"series":{"title":"Methods in Molecular Biology","issn":"1064-3745"},"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Assessing Distribution and Variation of Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Using Short-Read Sequencing","type":"chapter","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-7003-2_5","volume":"1610"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083342,"mean":6.8946797770799,"rank":6132145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1089565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083342,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233904,"mean":12.663412320492,"rank":165510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233904,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5799,"mean":1.9371700586409,"rank":3020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5799,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":0.90529411764706,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CompBiolPapers\/statuses\/857176751608385536","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19582839,19614171],"posted_on":"2017-04-26T10:17:17+00:00","author":{"name":"CompBiolPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848199297611026432\/GiXZ3YhG_normal.jpg","description":"Feed for sequencing papers","id_on_source":"CompBiolPapers","tweeter_id":"2365948482","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":699},"tweet_id":"857176751608385536"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/857240847892439041","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19582839,19614171],"posted_on":"2017-04-26T14:31:59+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
