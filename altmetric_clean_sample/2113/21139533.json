Loss of a single eNOS gene is not associated with any apparent negative consequences on endothelial function in most blood vessels. In contrast, we have recently demonstrated that heterozygous eNOS gene deficiency in combination with a high fat diet is associated with marked impairment of endothelial function. These findings provide an important example of eNOS haploinsufficiency and one that directly impacts the cerebral vasculature. A major mechanism associated with the impairment of endothelial function with eNOS deficiency and a high fat diet appears to be related to increases in plasma IL-6 that serves to further reduce the bioavailability of NO either directly or indirectly via reductions in eNOS expression or activity and via increases in vascular superoxide. Taken together, these findings provide important insights into genetic and molecular mechanisms that promote endothelial dysfunction in response to a high fat diet in cerebral blood vessels with inherent reductions in eNOS gene expression, such as those due to eNOS gene polymorphisms. These findings also highlight the importance of eNOS+\/- mice to study the effects of eNOS haploinsufficiency on cerebral blood vessels.","authors":["Didion, Sean P"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-17T12:46:21+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"handles":[],"issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of neurology & neuromedicine","last_mentioned_on":1497703567,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28616625?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28616625","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Heterozygous eNOS Deficient Mice as a Model to Examine the Effects of eNOS Haploinsufficiency on the Cerebral Circulation.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heterozygous-enos-deficient-mice-model-examine-effects-enos-haploinsufficiency-cerebral-circulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/876058376244875266","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21139533],"posted_on":"2017-06-17T12:46:07+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
