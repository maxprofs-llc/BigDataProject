Since FBN1 binds latent TGF-\u03b2 binding proteins (LTBPs), the major reservoir of TGF-\u03b2 in the extracellular matrix (ECM), we investigated the structural basis for the FBN1\/LTBP1 interaction.\u00a0We present the structure of a four-domain\u00a0FBN1 fragment, EGF2-EGF3-Hyb1-cbEGF1 (FBN1(E2cbEGF1)),\u00a0which reveals a near-linear domain organization. Binding studies demonstrate a bipartite interaction between a C-terminal LTBP1 fragment and FBN1(E2cbEGF1), which lies adjacent to the latency-associated propeptide (LAP)\/TGF-\u03b2 binding site of LTBP1. Modeling of the binding interface suggests that, rather than interacting along the longitudinal axis, LTBP1 anchors itself to FBN1 using two independent epitopes. As part of this mechanism, a flexible pivot adjacent to the FBN1\/LTBP1 binding site allows LTBP1 to make contacts with different ECM networks while presumably facilitating a force-induced\/traction-based TGF-\u03b2 activation mechanism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035d2","authors":["Ian B.
