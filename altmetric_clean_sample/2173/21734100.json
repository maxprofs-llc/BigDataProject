We found that alteration in most variables occurred, although the changes in values usually remained within published reference ranges. Also, recovery of these alterations to pre-collection values was rapid, occurring within 24--48 h in most instances. We concluded that volumes of blood less than or equal to 20 mL\/kg when collected appropriately from healthy donor horses result in no adverse acute or chronic physiological changes. These results suggest that horses undergo adequate physiological compensation when approximately 25% of blood volume is removed for the purposes of blood donation or production of plasma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fa","authors":["N.
