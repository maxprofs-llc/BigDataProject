In this article, we first review basic investigations that have identified and examined variables that influence choice responding, such as response effort and reinforcement rate, immediacy, and quality. We then describe recent bridge and applied studies that illustrate how the results of basic research on choice responding can help to account for human behavior in natural environments and improve clinical assessments and interventions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8c","authors":["W W Fisher","J E Mazur"],"doi":"10.1901\/jaba.1997.30-387","first_seen_on":"2012-05-03T02:37:45+00:00","issns":["0021-8855"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1336012412,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1284058\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1284058\/pdf\/9316255.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1284058","pmid":"9316255","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"387","subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Basic and applied research on choice responding.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/basic-applied-research-choice-responding"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":2312355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1573366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75864,"mean":4.4864922294135,"rank":33315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":31542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75864,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":622,"mean":6.9577681159419,"rank":320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":622,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
