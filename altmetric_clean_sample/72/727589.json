While most axial flow devices are associated with hemolysis, clinically relevant hemolysis with this device has not been reported. We report a case of a 66-year-old woman with hemodynamic collapse during an elective PCI who was successfully resuscitated with an Impella device. She developed marked biochemical evidence of intravascular hemolysis. This necessitated device removal which resulted in prompt resolution of the hemolysis. We advise routine measurement of biochemical markers of hemolysis and serial hemoglobin values during Impella device support to allow timely detection and treatment of this important complication.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e05","authors":["Sibbald M","D\u017eav\u00edk V"],"doi":"10.1002\/ccd.24280","first_seen_on":"2012-05-04T07:05:34+00:00","issns":["1522-1946"],"issue":"","journal":"Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (Formerly Catheterization and Cardiovascular Diagnosis)","last_mentioned_on":1336114421,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22511273?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22511273","pubdate":"2012-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Severe hemolysis associated with use of the impella LP 2.5 mechanical assist device.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/severe-hemolysis-associated-impella-lp-25-mechanical-assist-device"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3071134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":948317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75897,"mean":4.5499819226309,"rank":47389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75897,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":716,"mean":0.95522237762238,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":716,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.96153846153846,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Other":5,"Student  > Master":4,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":4,"Medicine and Dentistry":10,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/UHNLibraries\/status\/198304371451240448","citation_ids":[727589],"posted_on":"2012-05-04T06:53:41+00:00","author":{"name":"UHN Libraries","url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/11WlLxW","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/465909164892360704\/cit1rJi6_normal.jpeg","description":"University Health Network libraries are located at all our hospital sites, providing current research and information to physicians, staff and trainees.","id_on_source":"UHNLibraries","tweeter_id":"282224181","geo":{"lt":43.70011,"ln":-79.4163,"country":"CA"},"followers":781},"tweet_id":"198304371451240448"}]}}
