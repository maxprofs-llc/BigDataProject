Their criticisms are weakened by not giving an accurate characterization of the motivation behind Bayesian modeling or the ways in which Bayesian models are used and by not evaluating this theoretical framework against specific alternatives. We address these points by clarifying our beliefs about the goals and status of Bayesian models and by identifying what we view as the unique merits of the Bayesian approach.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d8","doi":"10.1037\/a0026884","first_seen_on":"2012-04-30T21:29:18+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["0033-2909 (Print)"],"journal":"Psychological Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1337098930,"links":["http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/bul\/138\/3\/415?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:+apa-journals-bul+(Psychological+Bulletin)"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/bul\/138\/3\/415.pdf","pmid":"22545687","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Psychological Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology","Arts and Humanities"],"title":"How the Bayesians got their beliefs (and what those beliefs actually are): Comment on Bowers and Davis (2012).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bayesians-beliefs-those-beliefs-actually-comment-bowers-davis-2012"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":781021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3721470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75679,"mean":4.5038380242606,"rank":11897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":63688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75679,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1050,"mean":8.7273326978074,"rank":363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1050,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":10.925,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":61,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
