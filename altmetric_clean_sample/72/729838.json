A crucial issue for nanopore sequencing is the fact that DNA translocates a nanopore too fast for addressing sequence with a single base resolution. Here we report that a transverse electric field can be used to slow down the translocation. We find 400-fold decrease in the DNA translocation speed by adding a transverse field of 10\u2005mV\/nm in a gold-electrode-embedded silicon dioxide channel. The retarded flow allowed us to map the local folding pattern in individual DNA from trans-pore ionic current profiles. This field dragging approach may provide a new way to control the polynucleotide translocation kinetics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012NatSR...2E.394T","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Makusu Tsutsui","Yuhui He","Masayuki Furuhashi","Sakon Rahong","Masateru Taniguchi","Tomoji Kawai"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep00394","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2012-05-05T19:33:14+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1336460618,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2012\/120503\/srep00394\/full\/srep00394.html"],"pmid":"22558512","pubdate":"2012-05-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"","subjects":["science"],"title":"Transverse electric field dragging of DNA in a nanochannel","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transverse-electric-field-dragging-dna-nanochannel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2294607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2718408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78185,"mean":4.7973221886831,"rank":28121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":49685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78185,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15808,"mean":13.303721895363,"rank":7491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":8173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15808,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":10.900036036036,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
