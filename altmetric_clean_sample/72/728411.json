For example, G protein-coupled receptors expressed within the nasal epithelium and taste receptors in the oral cavity have been identified as odorant and taste receptors, respectively. However, there is much evidence to indicate that these chemosensory receptors are not restricted to primary chemosensory cells; they are also expressed and have function in other cells such as those in the airways and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This short review describes the possible mechanisms by which taste signal transduction occurs in the oral cavity and tastants\/nutrients are sensed in the GI tract by taste-like cells, mainly enteroendocrine and brush cells. Furthermore, it discusses the future perspectives of chemosensory studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de1","authors":["Iwatsuki K","Uneyama H"],"first_seen_on":"2012-05-04T16:08:16+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Pharmacological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1336087854,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22293296"],"pmid":"22293296","pubdate":"2012-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Sense of Taste in the Gastrointestinal Tract.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sense-taste-gastrointestinal-tract"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630112,"mean":4.9307700568987,"rank":2899857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630112,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73022,"mean":4.191011325509,"rank":52664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73022,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205,"mean":1.754068627451,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.45,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
