Since these GAGs accumulate in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), we investigated the activity of ARSB in leukocytes of patients with CF, to consider if reduced activity of ARSB might contribute to the pathophysiology of CF. Previous cell-based experiments had demonstrated that when the deficiency of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) was corrected in bronchial epithelial cells, the ARSB activity increased significantly. De-identified, citrated blood samples were collected from 16 children with CF and 31 control subjects, seen in the Pediatric Clinic at Rush University Medical Center. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and mononuclear cell (MC) populations were separated by density gradient, and blinded determinations of ARSB activity were performed using the exogenous substrate 4-methylumbilliferyl sulfate. Interleukin-6 was measured in the plasma samples by ELISA. ARSB activity was significantly less in the PMN and MC from the CF patients than controls (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, unpaired t-test, two-tailed). Interleukin-6 levels in plasma were significantly greater in the CF population (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Mean age, age range, and male:female ratio of CF patients and controls were similar, and no association of ARSB activity with age, gender, or CFTR genotype was evident. Since recombinant human ARSB is used successfully for replacement therapy in Mucopolysaccharidosis VI, it may be useful to restore ARSB activity to normal levels and increase degradation of sulfated GAGs in CF patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000848a","authors":["Sharma, Girish","Burke, Jenifer","Bhattacharyya, Sumit","Sharma, Neha","Katyal, Shivani","Park, R.
