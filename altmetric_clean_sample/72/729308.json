Saffron (dry Crocus sativus stigmas) is one of the main known sources of crocins. In this study the potential use of aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) for the extraction of crocins from C. sativus stigmas was evaluated. The partitioning behavior of crocins in different types of ATPS (polymer-polymer, polymer-salt, alcohol-salt and ionic liquid-salt) was evaluated. Ethanol-potassium phosphate ATPS were selected based on their high top phase recovery yield and low cost of system constituents. The evaluation and optimization of system parameters rendered conditions (V(R)=3.2, ethanol 19.8% (w\/w), potassium phosphate 16.5% (w\/w), TLL of 25% (w\/w), 0.1M NaCl and 2% (w\/w) of sample load) under which more than 75% of total crocins were recovered in the top (ethanol rich) phase, whereas the wasted stigmas accumulated in the bottom phase. Lastly, a comparison between an optimized solid-liquid extraction using ethanol:water as solvent and ATPS was conducted demonstrating that similar yields are achieved with both strategies (76.89 \u00b1 18% and 79.27 \u00b1 1.6%, respectively). However, ATPS rendered a higher extraction selectivity of 1.3 \u00b1 0.04 mg of crocins for each mg of phenolic compound, whereas ethanolic extraction showed a selectivity of 0.87 \u00b1 0.01. The results reported herein demonstrate the potential application of ATPS, particularly ethanol-potassium phosphate systems, for the recovery of crocins from C. sativus stigmas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["Bertha Montalvo-Hern\u00e1ndez","Marco Rito-Palomares","Jorge Benavides"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chroma.2012.03.012","endpage":"15","first_seen_on":"2012-05-05T10:18:11+00:00","issns":["00219673"],"journal":"Journal of Chromatography A","last_mentioned_on":1336212489,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021967312003974"],"pmid":"22463999","pubdate":"2012-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"7","title":"Recovery of crocins from saffron stigmas (Crocus sativus) in aqueous two-phase systems","type":"article","volume":"1236","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recovery-crocins-saffron-stigmas-crocus-sativus-aqueous-twophase-systems"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3083369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":966861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75865,"mean":4.4976239586628,"rank":47389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75865,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1978,"mean":1.5452503793627,"rank":858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1978,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":0.71494845360825,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
