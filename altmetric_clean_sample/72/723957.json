The three-dimensional framework is made up from four Mn(2+)\/Mn(3+) cations surrounded octa-hedrally by O atoms. The MnO(6) octa-hedra are linked through edge- and corner-sharing. Three independent AsO(4) tetra-hedra are linked to the framework through common corners, delimiting channels along [100] in which two partly occupied Ag(+) sites reside, one on an inversion centre and with an occupancy of 0.631\u2005(4), the other on a general site and with an occupancy of 0.774\u2005(3), both within distorted tetra-hedral environments. One of the Mn sites is also located on an inversion centre and is partly occupied, with an occupancy of 0.916\u2005(5). Related compounds with alluaudite-type or rosemaryite-type structures are compared and discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ea","authors":["Driss, A."],"doi":"10.1107\/s1600536812018843","first_seen_on":"2012-05-03T05:37:40+00:00","issns":["1600-5368"],"journal":"Acta Crystallographica: Section E (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1337862196,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?wm2611&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2012\/06\/00\/wm2611\/wm2611.pdf","pmid":"22719272","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Wyllieite-type Ag1.09Mn3.46(AsO4)3","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2671141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1694206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78177,"mean":4.7860008442489,"rank":34832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":32453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78177,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1630,"mean":0.51704972375691,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1630,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/IUCr\/status\/197511769680392192","citation_ids":[723957],"posted_on":"2012-05-02T02:24:10+00:00","author":{"name":"IUCr","url":"http:\/\/www.iucr.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/586153889533145088\/vS5Kc1h5_normal.jpg","description":"Publications and activities of the International Union of Crystallography","id_on_source":"IUCr","tweeter_id":"84666459","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1762},"tweet_id":"197511769680392192"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/ActaCrystE\/status\/205635073767256065","citation_ids":[723957],"posted_on":"2012-05-24T12:23:16+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"205635073767256065"}]}}
