The combination of doripenem and colistin reduced the starting inocula by 2 logs for each isolate (range, 2.02 to 6.01 log(10)) and was bactericidal and synergistic against 75 and 50%, respectively. Among colistin- and pan-drug-resistant isolates, synergy was identified in 60 and 67%, respectively. All other combinations were inferior. We are currently evaluating the combination of doripenem and colistin as a frontline therapy for KPC infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","doi":"10.1128\/aac.06364-11","first_seen_on":"2012-05-04T13:47:16+00:00","issns":["1098-6596"],"journal":"Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1338840619,"links":["http:\/\/aac.asm.org\/content\/early\/2012\/03\/13\/AAC.06364-11.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/aac.asm.org\/content\/early\/2012\/03\/13\/AAC.06364-11.full.pdf","pmid":"22430958","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"The combination of doripenem and colistin is bactericidal and synergistic against colistin-resistant, carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combination-doripenem-colistin-bactericidal-synergistic-against-colistinresistant-carbapenemaseprodu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2319351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2591587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78153,"mean":4.8032083631897,"rank":28505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":47073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78153,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3972,"mean":3.8417970284563,"rank":1831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3972,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":2.0826885245902,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
