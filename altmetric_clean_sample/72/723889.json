On defect-free CNTs, the binding affinity with the Cu or Al cluster is very weak. When various defects such as vacancies, substitutional nickel defects, and nickel adatoms are introduced in CNTs to increase the binding strength, the binding energies of the metal nanoclusters increase substantially irrespective of types of defects. The effect of the Ni adatom is especially noticeable. Our results propose a method for improving the wettability of metal-CNT complex composites.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012Nanot..23t5204S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","doi":"10.1088\/0957-4484\/23\/20\/205204","first_seen_on":"2012-05-03T05:31:23+00:00","issns":["1361-6528"],"issue":"20","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1335930974,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22544038?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22544038","pubdate":"2012-04-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Enhanced binding strength between metal nanoclusters and carbon nanotubes with an atomic nickel defect.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhanced-binding-strength-between-metal-nanoclusters-carbon-nanotubes-atomic-nickel-defect"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3094829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":969663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75863,"mean":4.4853060030054,"rank":47424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75863,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":995,"mean":5.2880905432596,"rank":654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":995,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.6985405405405,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
