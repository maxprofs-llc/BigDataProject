Imprint and squash samples were obtained from one biopsy and then analysed. Comparison between cytology and histology was performed using Cohen's j coefficient.\nAppropriate samples for cytological evaluation were more often obtained with the squash technique (96% of the cases versus 68% with the imprint technique). The diagnoses obtained with cytological samples and by histology, considered as the gold standard, were compared. The same diagnosis was obtained with the squash technique in 65% of the cases. Furthermore, cytology was considered complementary to histology for gastric spiral organisms and mast cells identification.\nThese results suggest that squash cytology obtained from endoscopic biopsies of the gastrointestinal tract can provide relevant and additional information to histology in dogs and cats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e4f","authors":["Ruiz, G.","Verrot, L.","Laloy, E.","Benchekroun, G."],"doi":"10.1111\/jsap.12597","first_seen_on":"2016-11-11T04:30:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-5827"],"journal":"Journal of Small Animal Practice","last_mentioned_on":1478887764,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jsap.12597\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jsap.12597\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jsap.12597\/pdf","pmid":"27861922","pubdate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Diagnostic contribution of cytological specimens obtained from biopsies during gastrointestinal endoscopy in dogs and cats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnostic-contribution-cytological-specimens-obtained-biopsies-during-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-do"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7679268,"mean":6.5932591477757,"rank":5807956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1035002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7679268,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230576,"mean":12.948472401604,"rank":158770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":43842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230576,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":741,"mean":1.6032837837838,"rank":353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":741,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.0631578947368,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
