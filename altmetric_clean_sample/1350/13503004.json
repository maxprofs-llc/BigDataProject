SDHB mutation, greatest tumor diameter, and open operative resection were associated with a greater rate of local recurrence and distant metastases (P\u00a0<\u00a0.006 each). SDHB mutation and tumor diameter were independent risk factors for local recurrence (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.04 each) and metastases. Ki67% and mitotic index were not associated with SDHB mutation (P\u00a0\u2265\u00a0.09 each), local recurrence (P\u00a0=\u00a0.48, P\u00a0=\u00a0.066, respectively), metastases (P\u00a0\u2265\u00a0.22 each), or disease-free interval (P\u00a0\u2265\u00a0.19 each).\nSDHB status and primary tumor size are more predictive of patient outcome than Ki67% or mitotic index and should be part of any clinically relevant, prognostic scoring system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008a97","authors":["Assadipour, Yasmine","Sadowski, Samira M","Alimchandani, Meghna","Quezado, Martha","Steinberg, Seth M","Nilubol, Naris","Patel, Dhaval","Prodanov, Tamara","Pacak, Karel","Kebebew, Electron"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.surg.2016.05.050","first_seen_on":"2016-11-10T23:20:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00396060","1532-7361"],"journal":"Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1478820011,"links":["http:\/\/www.surgjournal.com\/article\/S0039-6060(16)30498-6\/fulltext?rss=yes"],"pmid":"27839933","pubdate":"2016-11-15T22:07:30+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"SDHB mutation status and tumor size but not tumor grade are important predictors of clinical outcome in pheochromocytoma and abdominal paraganglioma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sdhb-mutation-status-tumor-size-not-tumor-grade-important-predictors-clinical-outcome-pheochromocyto"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7672691,"mean":6.5915218985731,"rank":6639207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7672691,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232033,"mean":12.975723270928,"rank":187953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232033,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2202,"mean":3.122086324398,"rank":1749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2202,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":4.040389261745,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
