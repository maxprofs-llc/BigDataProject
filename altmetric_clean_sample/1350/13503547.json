Areas covered: In this paper, new technical developments in different aspects of robotic assisted NOTES interventions are reviewed. We further address new research opportunities for more widespread clinical acceptance of robotic assisted NOTES procedures. Expert Commentary: The application of robotics in NOTES intervention is still in its infancy. The development of more compact, smart and intuitive robotic NOTES systems holds much promise for the future of NOTES application.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d3","authors":["Siyang Zuo"],"doi":"10.1080\/17434440.2016.1254037","endpage":"11","first_seen_on":"2016-11-11T00:26:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1745-2422","1743-4440"],"journal":"Expert Review of Medical Devices","last_mentioned_on":1478825049,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17434440.2016.1254037?ai=1lx1o&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"27788609","pubdate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Current and emerging robotic assisted intervention for Notes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-emerging-robotic-assisted-intervention-notes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7679268,"mean":6.5932591477757,"rank":5533654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1871365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7679268,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230575,"mean":12.948528776011,"rank":148349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":71811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230575,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314,"mean":2.8579552715655,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":18.248,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
