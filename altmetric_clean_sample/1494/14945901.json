Isotopic purification, and the resulting seconds-long quantum coherence times, have recently put Si at the forefront of efforts to create a solid state quantum processor. Here we demonstrate strong coupling of a single electron in a silicon double quantum dot to the photonic field of a microwave cavity, as shown by the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting. Strong coupling of a quantum dot electron to a cavity photon would allow for long-range qubit coupling, and the long-range entanglement of electrons in semiconductor quantum dots.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","arxiv_id":"1703.03047","authors":["X.
