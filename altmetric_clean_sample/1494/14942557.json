Five days later, biopsies were harvested from both wounded (healing gingiva) and contralateral site (normal gingiva). Tissue samples were processed for gene expression (RNA-Seq, real-time PCR) and immuno-histochemistry. Gene-set enrichment\/pathway analysis was also performed.\nSeven hundred genes were significantly differentially expressed in healing gingiva. Among genes with >2-fold change in expression, 399 genes were up-regulated and 88 down-regulated, several not previously reported expressed in gingiva. Most increased in expression (\u226530-fold change) were MMP1, CCL18, SPP1, MUC21, CTHRC1, MMP10, and SERPINE1; most decreased (\u22657-fold change) were COCH, SIAH3, MT4, IGFL3, KY, and SYT16. Real-time PCR confirmed significantly changed mRNA levels for selective genes tested. Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed several significantly enriched biological pathways. Immunohistochemistry confirmed protein expression of MUC21, CTHRC1, CTGF, and SYT16, in normal and healing gingiva.\nThis first comprehensive analysis of the human gingival transcriptome during surgical wound healing offers novel insights into the participating molecular and biological mechanisms. The present results could serve as basis for future investigations into gingival wound healing following surgical, traumatic or other type of injury. This article is protected by copyright.
