(Lei)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Detailed understanding of the interaction between a chiral molecule and a noble metal surface is essential to rationalize and advance interfacial self-assembly of amino acids and metal-mediated anchoring of proteins. Here we demonstrate that individual Au@Ag core-shell nanocuboids can serve as a plasmonic reporter of an extended helical network formed among chemisorbed cysteine molecules, through generating an interband absorption enhanced, Ag-surface-exclusive circular dichroism (CD) band in the UV region. The observed unusual, strong CD response in the hybrid Au@Ag-cysteine system can be used to probe in real time conformational evolution and structural rearrangement of biomolecules in general and also monitor the interfacial interaction between a metal surface and an adsorbed molecule, opening up the possibility of using Ag nanostructures as promising stereochemically attuned nanosensors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Bao, Zhi Yong","Zhang, Wei","Zhang, Yong\u2010Liang","He, Jijun","Dai, Jiyan","Yeung, Chi\u2010Tung","Law, Ga\u2010Lai","Lei, Dang Yuan"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201607563","first_seen_on":"2016-12-22T15:02:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3773"],"journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
