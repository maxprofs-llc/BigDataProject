These results suggest that comparable 11-KT levels in both sexes may allow serial adult sex change to take place in bi-directional sex-changing species, such as Gobiodon spp.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002da9","authors":["Kroon, F.J.","Munday, P.L.","Westcott, D.A.","Kroon FJ","Munday PL","Westcott DA"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1095-8649.2009.02274.x","first_seen_on":"2013-01-31T05:44:25+00:00","issns":["1095-8649","10958649","00221112"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Fish Biology","last_mentioned_on":1359607980,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1095-8649.2009.02274.x"],"pmid":"20738565","pubdate":"2009-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Equivalent whole\u2010body concentrations of 11\u2010ketotestosterone in female and male coral goby Gobiodon erythrospilus, a bidirectional sex\u2010changing fish","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/equivalent-wholebody-concentrations-11ketotestosterone-female-male-coral-goby-gobiodon-erythrospilus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.016,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.016},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":599256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3027475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280627,"mean":5.8191976010775,"rank":53409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":227181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280627,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":994,"mean":3.40489224572,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":994,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180,"mean":3.9523351955307,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
