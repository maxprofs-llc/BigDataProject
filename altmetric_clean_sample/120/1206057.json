Many compounds have been used in attempts to eradicate the parasite, and an accumulating body of data indicates that successful antimicrobial eradication of Blastocystis is far from straightforward. This review focuses on some issues that prevent us from reaching a clear understanding of how to eradicate Blastocystis based on chemotherapeutic intervention, by focusing on conflicting reports on the efficacy of metronidazole and other compounds and study design and data limitations. The review provides a comprehensive overview of antimicrobials used to target Blastocystis, and discusses issues pertaining to drug resistance, treatment failure, and reinfection. Finally, key methodological and molecular diagnostic tools that will assist in the generation of data required to improve current knowledge are identified and discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be5","authors":["Stensvold CR","Smith HV","Nagel R","Olsen KE","Traub RJ","Christen R.
