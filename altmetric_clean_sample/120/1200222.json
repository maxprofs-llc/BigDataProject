Using a murine model of obliterative airway disease (OAD), we recently demonstrated that Abs to MHC class I antigens can induce immune responses to self-antigens that contributes to immunopathogenesis of chronic rejection. Using a murine model of OAD, we determined the role of IL-17 family members in induction of autoimmunity leading to OAD after ligation of MHC class I.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008bed","doi":"10.1097\/tp.0b013e3182772244","first_seen_on":"2013-01-27T04:44:23+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["0041-1337"],"issue":"2","journal":"Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1359261858,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/transplantjournal\/Abstract\/2013\/01270\/Critical_Role_for_IL_17A_F_in_the.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/transplantjournal\/2013\/01270\/Critical_Role_for_IL_17A_F_in_the.8.pdf","pmid":"23325004","pubdate":"2013-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"293","title":"Critical Role for IL-17A\/F in the Immunopathogenesis of Obliterative Airway Disease Induced by Anti-MHC I Antibodies","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/critical-role-il17af-immunopathogenesis-obliterative-airway-disease-induced-antimhc-i-antibodies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3075940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":954001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286543,"mean":6.0106378890354,"rank":194586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":54653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286543,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2134,"mean":1.7044791373652,"rank":1314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2134,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":1.3621359223301,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
