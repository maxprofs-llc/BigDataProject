The ELISA test identified 21 seropositive goats - 15 in Western Pomerania (16% of all goats tested in this province), five in Lubuskie (6%) and one in Lower Silesia (2%). Our study demonstrates for the first time the presence of antibodies to SBV in Poland.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003688","authors":["Kaba J","Czopowicz M","Witkowski L","Kaba, J.","Czopowicz, M.","Witkowski, L."],"doi":"10.1111\/tbed.12039","endpage":"3","first_seen_on":"2013-01-27T20:41:42+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1865-1682","1865-1674"],"issue":"1","journal":"Transboundary & Emerging Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1400112000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23302324?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/tbed.12039"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tbed.12039\/pdf","pmid":"23302324","pubdate":"2013-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"1","title":"Schmallenberg virus antibodies detected in poland.","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/schmallenberg-virus-antibodies-detected-poland"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3788614,"mean":4.9961344153549,"rank":720318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3043553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3788614,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282789,"mean":5.8286169498001,"rank":62374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":219334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282789,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":1.7747192118227,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.0631,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
