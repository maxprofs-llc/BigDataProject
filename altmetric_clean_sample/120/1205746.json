In many brain areas, membrane potential is bistable, transiting between a relatively hyperpolarized down state and a depolarized up state. These up and down states, which have been proposed to play a number of computational roles, have mainly been studied in anesthetized and in vitro preparations. Here, we have used intracellular recordings to characterize the dynamics of membrane potential in the auditory cortex of awake rats. We find that long up states are rare in the awake auditory cortex, with only 0.4% of up states >500 ms. Most neurons displayed only brief up states (bumps) and spent on average \u223c1% of recording time in up states >500 ms. We suggest that the near absence of long up states in awake auditory cortex may reflect an adaptation to the rapid processing of auditory stimuli.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e78","authors":["Hromadka T","Zador AM","Deweese MR"],"doi":"10.1152\/jn.00600.2012","first_seen_on":"2013-01-29T20:51:43+00:00","issns":["0022-3077"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Neurophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1366279222,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23343898\/?i=1&from=deweese%20m"],"pmid":"23343898","pubdate":"2013-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["physiology","neurology"],"title":"Up-states are Rare in Awake Auditory Cortex.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/up-states-rare-awake-auditory-cortex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5553070,"mean":6.3836817237475,"rank":3915127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":929201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5553070,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292566,"mean":6.3823871003027,"rank":193796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":52050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292566,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3972,"mean":2.3969126164694,"rank":2102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3972,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":3.2818273381295,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
