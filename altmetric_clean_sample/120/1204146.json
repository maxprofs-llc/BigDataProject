However, very few clinically relevant reports exist investigating the effects of exercise performed during and following DOX treatments. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the effects of voluntary wheel running during and following DOX treatment using two models of late-onset DOX cardiotoxicity in the rat. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received either DOX or saline injections using one of two separate treatment regimens. These regimens involved either daily or weekly DOX injections with cumulative doses for both protocols totaling 15 mg\/kg. Daily DOX injections were 1 mg\/kg and lasted for 15 consecutive days while weekly DOX injections were 2.5 mg\/kg and lasted for six consecutive weeks with control animals receiving matched saline injection regimens. Immediately following the initial DOX\/saline injection, animals were randomly housed in cages with voluntary running wheels or standard rat cages throughout DOX\/saline treatments and continued until reaching 10 weeks. Cardiac function was then assessed using echocardiography and an isolated working heart model, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform distribution was assessed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When compared wth controls, daily DOX treatment resulted in reduced running wheel distances at weeks 2-10 (P < 0.05), and weekly DOX treatment resulted in reduced running wheel distances at weeks 2, 6 and 10 (P < 0.05). Nonetheless, wheel running during and following daily and weekly DOX dosing protected against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by preserving maximal mitral and aortic blood flow velocities, left ventricular developed pressure and MHC isoform expression. In conclusion, the overall reduced volume of activity during and following daily and weekly DOX treatments attenuated DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction suggesting that low-volume endurance training may be an effective rehabilitative approach in minimizing DOX cardiotoxicity in cancer patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b7","doi":"10.1258\/ebm.2012.012137","first_seen_on":"2013-01-29T13:42:39+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1535-3699"],"issue":"12","journal":"Experimental Biology and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1363865539,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23354407?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23354407","pubdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology","physiology"],"title":"Rehabilitative exercise in a rat model of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.","type":"article","volume":"237","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rehabilitative-exercise-rat-model-doxorubicin-cardiotoxicity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3076546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":954971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285471,"mean":6.0350444810312,"rank":194097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":54597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285471,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":530,"mean":2.8710434782609,"rank":311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":530,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":4.4647692307692,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
