It was first discovered in 1921 and popularized in 1990s. EGG is attractive because it is non-invasive. However, due to its non-invasive nature, there have also been controversies regarding validity and applications of EGG. The aim of this review is to discuss the methodologies, validation and applications of EGG. Pros and cons of EGG will also be discussed in detail. First, the gastric slow wave and its correlation with gastric motility are presented. The association between gastric dysrhythmia and impaired gastric motility is reviewed. Secondly the method for recording the electrogastrogram is presented in detail and pitfalls in the recording and analysis of EGG are discussed. Thirdly, findings reported in the literature demonstrating the accuracy of EGG in recording gastric slow waves and gastric dysrhythmia are reviewed and discussed. The correlation of the electrogastrogram with gastric contraction is carefully discussed. Finally, applications of EGG in a few major areas are reviewed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc9f","authors":["Chen, Jiande D Z"],"doi":"10.5056\/jnm.2013.19.1.5","first_seen_on":"2013-01-28T15:28:54+00:00","issns":["2093-0879"],"journal":"Journal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility","last_mentioned_on":1359386242,"links":["http:\/\/synapse.koreamed.org\/DOIx.php?id=10.5056\/jnm.2013.19.1.5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/synapse.koreamed.org\/Synapse\/Data\/PDFData\/0081JNM\/jnm-19-5.pdf","pmid":"23350042","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Electrogastrography: Methodology, Validation and Applications","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electrogastrography-methodology-validation-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2936540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1427257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285383,"mean":6.0233990370802,"rank":184965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":89458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285383,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":391,"mean":1.0723076923077,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":391,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.1315789473684,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
