Strange condition"],"citation":{"abstract":"Cryptogenic new onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) syndrome has been described in both adults and children, and is often associated with poor outcome. A variety of terms have been used in the literature to refer to this syndrome. The condition may be triggered by as yet unidentified infections or an immunological mechanism. We present a series of 5 patients with NORSE syndrome treated at 2 neuroscience centres in the North of England, in whom early use of immunotherapy appears to be associated with good neurological outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088e0","authors":["Mohanraj, Rajiv","Gall, Claire R.E.","Jumma, Odai"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.seizure.2012.12.016","endpage":"220","first_seen_on":"2013-01-28T16:16:30+00:00","issns":["1059-1311","10591311"],"issue":"3","journal":"Seizure","last_mentioned_on":1359144908,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S105913111200338X"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.seizure-journal.com\/article\/S1059-1311(12)00338-X\/pdf","pmid":"23333762","pubdate":"2013-01-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"217","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Five cases of new onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) syndrome: Outcomes with early immunotherapy","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/five-cases-new-onset-refractory-status-epilepticus-norse-syndrome-outcomes-early-immunotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7621936,"mean":6.5606726932161,"rank":6597727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7621936,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296773,"mean":6.6701414890893,"rank":247436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296773,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":820,"mean":3.0166691086691,"rank":642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":820,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.104347826087,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
