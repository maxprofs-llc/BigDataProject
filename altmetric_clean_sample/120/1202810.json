We hypothesized that intact mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is necessary for cardiac protection in females. We first tested sex differences and intracellular signaling after mTOR targeting with rapamycin in wild-type mice. Radio-telemetric blood pressure was maintained at normal for 6 weeks. Rapamycin significantly reduced left ventricular hypertrophy, preserved ejection fraction, inhibited fibrosis, and maintained capillary structure in male mice. Decreased mTORC1 and increased mTORC2 activity were detected in rapamycin-treated male mice compared with vehicle controls. In contrast, female mice developed dilative left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and capillary loss similar to DOCA-salt females lacking the estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2(-\/-)) that we described earlier. Because rapamycin downregulated ER\u03b2 in female mice, we next studied ER\u03b2(-\/-) normotensive DOCA-salt females. Vehicle-treated wild-type females maintained their high constitutive mTORC1 and mTORC2 in response to DOCA-salt. In contrast to males, both mTORCs were decreased by rapamycin, in particular mTORC2 by 60%. ER\u03b2(-\/-) DOCA-salt females showed similar mTORC1 and mTORC2 response patterns. We suggest that ER\u03b2-dependent regulation involves sex-specific use of mTOR signaling branches. Maintenance of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling seems to be essential for adaptive cardiac remodeling in females and supports a rationale for sex-specific therapeutic strategies in left ventricular hypertrophy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007693","authors":["Duska Dragun"],"doi":"10.1161\/hypertensionaha.111.00276","first_seen_on":"2013-01-28T20:21:07+00:00","issns":["1524-4563"],"journal":"Hypertension (Highwire)","last_mentioned_on":1375430525,"links":["http:\/\/hyper.ahajournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/21\/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.00276.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hyper.ahajournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/21\/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.00276.full.pdf","pmid":"23339165","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Sex-Specific mTOR Signaling Determines Sexual Dimorphism in Myocardial Adaptation in Normotensive DOCA-Salt Model","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexspecific-mtor-signaling-determines-sexual-dimorphism-myocardial-adaptation-normotensive-docasalt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228985,"mean":5.9651782765876,"rank":2267262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3934307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228985,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270512,"mean":6.7195576815731,"rank":94784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":174092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270512,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2603,"mean":6.1293520368947,"rank":854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2603,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273,"mean":7.2239338235294,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
