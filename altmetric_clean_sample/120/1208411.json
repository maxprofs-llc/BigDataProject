Read abstract here: #PHLBI #PMC"],"citation":{"abstract":"The biomarker mesothelin is a useful diagnostic tool in malignant mesothelioma (MM) patients. It has high specificity but a sensitivity of only 50%. As mesothelin binds CA125, and as CA125 is often elevated in MM, we asked whether this binding affected measurable mesothelin levels in a relevant clinical setting. Mesothelin and CA125 concentrations were measured in the serum of 41 patients with MM. An assay was developed to detect mesothelin bound to CA125. Mesothelin was demonstrated to be bound by CA125 in 9 of 41 MM patients. This binding could be broken by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulphate and diethylenetriaminepenta acetic acid (DTPA) to the samples, however this did not lead to any change in the mesothelin level measured. We therefore conclude that binding of mesothelin to CA125 does not alter the measurement of mesothelin for the detection of MM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fe3cf058f610003039","authors":["Creaney J","Dick IM","Dare H","Demelker Y","Nowak AK","Musk AW","Robinson BW"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.lungcan.2012.12.008","endpage":"44","first_seen_on":"2013-01-30T18:21:20+00:00","issns":["1872-8332","0169-5002","01695002"],"issue":"1","journal":"Lung Cancer (01695002)","last_mentioned_on":1359637879,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23357461"],"pmid":"23357461","pubdate":"2013-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"39","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Does CA125 binding to mesothelin impact the detection of malignant mesothelioma?","type":"article","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ca125-binding-mesothelin-impact-detection-malignant-mesothelioma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7533575,"mean":6.5103292888566,"rank":3252980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4195779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7533575,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295648,"mean":6.6625668652143,"rank":113652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":177858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295648,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":755,"mean":7.0286445623342,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":755,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.054347826087,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/PHeartLungBlood\/status\/296684494688247808","citation_ids":[1208411],"posted_on":"2013-01-30T18:21:10+00:00","author":{"name":"PHLBI","url":"http:\/\/www.phlbi.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2460722391\/9ymv795j367tsf2drvfd_normal.jpeg","description":"The PHLBI is a nonprofit research facility committed to advancing medical research that may lead to new treatments and prevention programs for chronic disorders","id_on_source":"PHeartLungBlood","tweeter_id":"733572745","geo":{"lt":34.05223,"ln":-118.24368,"country":"US"},"followers":53},"tweet_id":"296684494688247808"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RN4Mesothelioma\/statuses\/296684492645609473","license":"public","citation_ids":[1208411],"posted_on":"2013-01-30T18:21:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Savannah Cline","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2734034917\/8c43cd2c0deaf986967de619fd0af18e_normal.jpeg","description":"RN, BSN.
