Accurately measuring vaccine effectiveness (VE) is difficult. The clinical syndrome most closely associated with influenza virus infection, influenza-like illness (ILI), is not specific. In addition, laboratory confirmation is infrequently done, and available rapid diagnostic tests are imperfect. The objective of this study was to estimate the joint impact of rapid diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity on VE for three types of study designs: a cohort study, a traditional case-control study, and a case-control study that used as controls individuals with ILI who tested negative for influenza virus infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b49","authors":["Walter A Orenstein","Orenstein, Evan W","De Serres, Gaston","Haber, Michael J","Shay, David K","Bridges, Carolyn B","Gargiullo, Paul","Orenstein, Walter A"],"doi":"10.1093\/ije\/dym021","first_seen_on":"2013-01-29T21:22:56+00:00","issns":["1464-3685","0300-5771"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1453002763,"links":["http:\/\/ije.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/36\/3\/623.full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17403908","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/ije\/dym021"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ije.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/36\/3\/623.full.pdf","pmid":"17403908","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Methodologic issues regarding the use of three observational study designs to assess influenza vaccine effectiveness.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methodologic-issues-regarding-three-observational-study-designs-assess-influenza-vaccine-effectivene-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.852,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.852},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8094378,"mean":6.8925303985645,"rank":692795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7405100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8094378,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300064,"mean":6.9062645711066,"rank":31419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":268644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300064,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3213,"mean":11.942966998755,"rank":504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3213,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":16.765285714286,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
