The nodule persisted for 10 months until it was excised. Subsequent investigation for malignancy and systemic disease showed no pathological findings. The diagnosis, persistent itching vaccination granuloma, was revealed by hazard almost 2 years after the onset of symptoms. Persistent itching subcutaneous nodules at the injection site for aluminium containing vaccines (mostly diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis combination vaccines for primary immunisation of infants) may appear with a long delay after the vaccination (months), cause prolonged itching (years) and are often associated with contact allergy to aluminium. The condition is poorly recognised in Health Care which may lead to prolonged symptoms and unnecessary investigations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Elisabet Bergfors","Katarzyna Lundmark","Ulla Nystr\u00f6m Kronander"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2012-007779","first_seen_on":"2013-01-30T13:21:29+00:00","issns":["1757-790X",""],"issue":"jan24 1","journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1491075490,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23354861","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3604306\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3604306\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/casereports.bmj.com\/content\/2013\/bcr-2012-007779.full.pdf","pmid":"23354861","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Group","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"A child with a long-standing, intensely itching subcutaneous nodule on a thigh: an uncommon (?) reaction to commonly used vaccines.","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abstract-child-longstanding-intensely-itching-subcutaneous-nodule-thigh-uncommon-reaction-commonly-u"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":4013852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4244798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300974,"mean":6.9885767161838,"rank":129891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":161240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300974,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3316,"mean":5.478766214178,"rank":1020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3316,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231,"mean":1.7405739130435,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"A child with a long-standing, intensely itching...
