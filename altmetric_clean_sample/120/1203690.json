Residents referred for psychiatric consultation were similar with regard to demographic characteristics, but were more cognitively intact. The most common reasons for referral were depressive symptoms, agitated behavior, and perceptual distortions. Interventions involving medication were the most frequently used, followed by relocating the resident, staff interventions, and psychotherapy. Treatments that involved moving the resident were rated as less effective. Overall, significant improvement was noted in slightly more than half of all residents referred for psychiatric consultation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006978","authors":["Jeanne Samter","Judith V.
