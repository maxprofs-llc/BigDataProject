The phenotype was pleiotropic and included the formation of extra cotyledons, changes in leaf shape, increased number of flowers (indeterminacy) with abnormal floral organs, the formation of epiphyllous structures, and altered gravitropism. The earliest defects were observed at the transition from the globular to the heart stage of embryogenesis with the formation of multiple cotyledons. Epidermal cells in the mutant embryo were smaller and less expanded compared with wild type. Examination of polar auxin transport (PAT) showed a striking enhancement in the case of the mutant. Increase in PAT did not appear to be caused by a decrease in flavonoids because the mutant had normal flavonoid levels. Application of 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid, an inhibitor of polar transport of auxin, rescued postgermination phenotypes of young seedlings. Our analysis reveals a level of control that negatively regulates PAT in tomato and its contribution to plant development and organogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Al-Hammadi, Arif S A","Sreelakshmi, Yellamaraju","Negi, Sangeeta","Siddiqi, Imran","Sharma, Rameshwar"],"first_seen_on":"2013-01-30T16:31:09+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0032-0889"],"issue":"1","journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1359563344,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12970479"],"pmcid":"PMC196586","pmid":"12970479","pubdate":"2003-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The American Society for Plant Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"The polycotyledon mutant of tomato shows enhanced polar auxin transport.","type":"article","volume":"133","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polycotyledon-mutant-tomato-shows-enhanced-polar-auxin-transport"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635501,"mean":4.9219382456039,"rank":2018568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635501,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280419,"mean":5.8033882275747,"rank":150362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":79764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280419,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2100,"mean":2.5569919009052,"rank":1067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2100,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":2.1276770186335,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
