Bacterial type II CRISPR systems have been adapted to create guide RNAs that direct site-specific DNA cleavage by the Cas9 endonuclease in cultured cells. Here we show that the CRISPR-Cas system functions in vivo to induce targeted genetic modifications in zebrafish embryos with efficiencies similar to those obtained using zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003162","authors":["Woong Y Hwang","Yanfang Fu","Deepak Reyon","Morgan L Maeder","Shengdar Q Tsai","Jeffry D Sander","Randall T Peterson","J-R Joanna Yeh","J Keith Joung","Hwang WY","Fu Y","Reyon D","Maeder ML","Tsai SQ","Sander JD","Peterson RT","Yeh JR","Joung JK","Woong Y.
