This DNA preparation was used to transform E. coli cells, selecting colicin-E1-resistant clones that contain hybrid ColE1-yeast DNA plasmids. Sufficient numbers of transformant clones were obtained to ensure that the hybrid plasmid population was representative of the entire yeast genome. Various hybrid ColE1-yeast DNA plasmids capable of complementing E. coli auxotrophic mutations were selected from this population. Plasmid pYeleu 10 complements several different point or deletion mutations in the E. coli or S. typhimurium leuB gene (beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase); plasmids pYeleu11, pYeleu12, and pYeleu17 are specific suppressors of the leuB6 mutation in E. coli C600. Plasmid pYehis2 complements a deletion in the E. coli hisB gene (imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase). Complementation of bacterial mutations by yeast DNA segments does not appear to be a rare phenomenon.","ads_id":"1977PNAS...74..487R","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["B Ratzkin","J Carbon"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.74.2.487","first_seen_on":"2016-01-20T07:45:21+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"2","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1453275907,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.74.2.487"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/74\/2\/487.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC392314","pmid":"322128","pubdate":"1977-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Functional expression of cloned yeast DNA in Escherichia coli","type":"article","volume":"74","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functional-expression-cloned-yeast-dna-escherichia-coli-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997887,"mean":6.2543742573087,"rank":1639256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4548852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997887,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315482,"mean":9.2021366865197,"rank":91619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":218123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315482,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42351,"mean":21.829605430933,"rank":19611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":14711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42351,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1050,"mean":44.609439466158,"rank":591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1050,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Yeast artificial chromosome","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=700730593#altmetric_citation_9b8d7058-53cb-4ad7-be0d-29b70d9768e2","license":"public","citation_ids":[5015260],"posted_on":"2016-01-20T07:45:07+00:00","summary":"Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) are genetically engineered chromosomes derived from the DNA of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is then ligated into a bacterial plasmid.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=394765","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rjwilmsi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rjwilmsi"}}]}}
