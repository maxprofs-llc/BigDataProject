A continuous wave (CW) laser was focused inside a micro-chamber filled with a light-absorbing solution to create a rapidly expanding vapor bubble. The chamber is connected to a micro-channel which focuses and ejects the liquid jet through the exit. The bubble growth and the jet velocity were measured as a function of the devices geometry (channel diameter D and chamber width A). The fastest jets were those for relatively large chamber size with respect to the channel diameter. Elongated and focused jets up to 29\u2009m\/s for a channel diameter of [Formula: see text] and chamber size of [Formula: see text] were obtained. The proposed CW laser-based device is potentially a compact option for a practical and commercially feasible needle-free injector.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f6100039c3","authors":["Carla Berrospe-Rodriguez","Carla Berrospe-Rodriguez","Claas Willem Visser","Stefan Schlautmann","Ruben Ramos-Garcia","David Fernandez Rivas"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4940038","first_seen_on":"2016-01-20T13:28:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-1058"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biomicrofluidics","last_mentioned_on":1453294801,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1063\/1.4940038"],"pmid":"26858816","pubdate":"2016-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Interdisciplinary Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Classical Physics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Continuous-wave laser generated jets for needle free applications","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/continuouswave-laser-generated-jets-needle-free-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997887,"mean":6.2543742573087,"rank":6007627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997887,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315481,"mean":9.2022756878405,"rank":258718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315481,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":431,"mean":3.5232093023256,"rank":285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":431,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":4.36525,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
