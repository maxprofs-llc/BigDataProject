The management is challenging and carries high morbidity and mortality.\nWe describe successful percutaneous reconstruction using a covered stent in a similar patient who is doing well two-years after intervention. A literature search was done to explore management strategies and their long-term outcomes for better understanding.\nThis report is an attempt to highlight the role of minimal invasive approach in the management of rare, severe coarctation of the aorta in adult patients to avoid morbidity and mortality associated with more invasive procedures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000084a","authors":["Jha, Neerod Kumar","Tofeig, Magdi","Kumar, Rajappan Arun","ElTahir, Amin","Athar, Syed Mohammad","AlHakami, Aref","Khan, Arshad","Khan, Mohammad Daud"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13019-016-0395-1","first_seen_on":"2016-01-20T11:19:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1749-8090"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1473934177,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26781635?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26781635?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4717556","pmid":"26781635","pubdate":"2016-01-20T22:01:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Stent dilatation of atretic aortic coarctation in an adult-case report and literature review.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stent-dilatation-atretic-aortic-coarctation-adultcase-report-literature-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":7249360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":332501,"mean":9.5123481744357,"rank":278106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":332501,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":324,"mean":2.4721919504644,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":324,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.0925,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/statuses\/689767498321895424","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5016262],"posted_on":"2016-01-20T11:12:41+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":222},"tweet_id":"689767498321895424"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/statuses\/776362327935451136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5016262],"posted_on":"2016-09-15T10:09:37+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":222},"tweet_id":"776362327935451136"}]}}
