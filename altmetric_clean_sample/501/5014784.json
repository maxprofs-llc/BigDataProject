To assess the possible role of HBsAg immune escape variants in OBI patients, variability in the HBV S gene was evaluated for OBI patients as well as chronic HBV infection patients from the same families.\nWe selected 17 HBV DNA-positive\/HBsAg-negative patients (OBI group) and 15 HBV DNA- and HBsAg-positive patients from OBI families (control group). The S gene was amplified and cloned, and at least 15 clones per patient were sequenced and analyzed.\nAlthough the incidence of stop codon mutations within the S region was higher in the OBI group (13.6\u00a0%) than in the control group (1.5\u00a0%, P\u2009<\u20090.001), this type of mutation, together with insertion and deletion mutations, was prevalent in only three OBI patients. In the major hydrophilic region (MHR), a median of 0.75 residues were altered in every 100 residues for the OBI patients, whereas 0.95 out of 100 residues were changed in the control group (P\u2009=\u20090.428). Furthermore, some variants that are generally considered immune escape variants, such as mutations at positions s145, s147, and s123, were only observed in less than 5\u00a0% of all the clones sequenced, in either OBI or control group.\nOur data suggest that HBsAg variants may not play a major role in OBI pathogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a9","authors":["Zhenhua Zhang","Zhenhua Zhang","Ling Zhang","Yu Dai","Yafei Zhang","Jun Li","Xu Li"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12985-016-0464-z","first_seen_on":"2016-01-20T03:29:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1743-422X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Virology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1453263700,"links":["http:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12985-016-0464-z?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12985-016-0464-z?site=http:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4717550","pmid":"26786229","pubdate":"2016-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"1","title":"Occult hepatitis B virus infection: influence of S protein variants","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/occult-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-influence-s-protein-variants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997887,"mean":6.2543742573087,"rank":2852962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4063262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997887,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315481,"mean":9.2021428743499,"rank":123239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":187401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315481,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1502,"mean":3.3854790139907,"rank":612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1502,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":4.5842272727273,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"TZ":1},"mendeley":{"CO":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VirologyJ\/statuses\/689650950085021696","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5014784],"posted_on":"2016-01-20T03:29:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Virology Journal","url":"http:\/\/virologyj.biomedcentral.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2412502248\/49xz64c5b5p98ent0tkj_normal.png","description":"Virology Journal is an open access, peer reviewed journal that publishes research on all aspects of virology, edited by Linfa Wang.Most tweets by @DanaBerryBMC","id_on_source":"VirologyJ","tweeter_id":"705226320","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":4421},"tweet_id":"689650950085021696"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JoeMugasa\/statuses\/689654820886683649","license":"gnip","rt":["VirologyJ"],"citation_ids":[5014784],"posted_on":"2016-01-20T03:44:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Rodrigo Duterte","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848379685373452289\/S0KPaEJn_normal.jpg","description":"Buoyant, waggish, efficacious, indefatigable, demiurgic, convivial, self-made thousandaire and a father of two.
