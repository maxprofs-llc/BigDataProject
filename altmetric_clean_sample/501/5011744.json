Vaccination of VZV-seronegative cancer patients with live-attenuated varicella vaccine is safe when chemotherapy is interrupted. However, VZV vaccination without interruption of chemotherapy would be preferable.\nTo vaccinate VZV-seronegative pediatric oncology patients with live-attenuated VZV vaccine without interrupting their chemotherapy.\nWe performed a single-center prospective cohort study.\nThirty-one patients with either a hematological malignancy (n=24) or a solid tumor (n=7) were vaccinated early during their course of chemotherapy. VZV IgG seroconversion occurred in 14 of the 31 patients (45%) after one vaccination. Only 20 patients were revaccinated after 3 months. These were patients who did not seroconvert (5 patients) and patients who serocoverted (15 patients) to induce or sustain seropositivity. Of these 20 patients the final seroconversion rate was 70%. Seven out of the 31 patients (23%) developed a mild rash of which 5 were treated with antivirals and recovered completely without interrupting chemotherapy, and 2 recovered untreated. Of these 31 immunized patients 26 were available for cellular testing. After one vaccination 20 of 26 patients (77%) tested positive for VZV-specific CD4(+) T cells, of which 7 patients had remained VZV-seronegative. After the second vaccination 11 of 11 patients showed VZV-specific CD4(+) T cells to sustain positivity, although 4 remained VZV-seronegative.\nThis study indicates that live-attenuated VZV vaccine can be safely administered to closely monitored pediatric oncology patients without interruption of chemotherapy and adaptive immunity was induced despite incomplete seroconversion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d09","authors":["van de Wetering, Marianne D","Vossen, Mireille T M","Jansen, Machiel H","Caron, Hubert N","Kuijpers, Taco W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcv.2016.01.004","first_seen_on":"2016-01-19T14:47:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5967","13866532"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","last_mentioned_on":1472629805,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26780112?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26780112?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26780112","pubdate":"2016-01-19T22:00:27+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Varicella vaccination in pediatric oncology patients without interruption of chemotherapy.","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/varicella-vaccination-pediatric-oncology-patients-without-interruption-chemotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":4423020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2312642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330759,"mean":9.5015327520418,"rank":173656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":121512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330759,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":901,"mean":4.2881155555556,"rank":527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":901,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.4096756756757,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
