The authors previously developed a mouse model for external volume expansion and demonstrated its pro-proliferative and angiogenic effects. Increased thickness of the subcutaneous tissue was also observed. This study was thus designed to assess the adipogenic potential of external volume expansion stimulation.\nA miniaturized external volume expansion device consisting of a rubber dome connected to a -25 mmHg suction source was applied to the dorsum of mice for a single 2-hour stimulation or for 2 hours daily for 5 days. Tissues were harvested up to 48 hours after the last stimulation and analyzed for edema, inflammation, and adipocyte content by staining for hematoxylin and eosin, CD45, and perilipin-A. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (proadipogenic factor) and preadipocyte factor 1 (preadipocyte marker) was evaluated by Western blot analysis.\nBoth a 2-hour stimulation and cyclical 2-hour stimulation for 5 days induced 1.5- and 1.9-fold increases in the number of adipocytes per millimeter. Edema was present in the immediate poststimulation period, and inflammation was seen 2 days later. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 was increased at the end of stimulation.\nStretch is known to stimulate proliferation, whereas edema and inflammation are both emerging proadipogenic factors. Their combination in external volume expansion seems to produce proadipogenic effects, seen even after a single 2-hour stimulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f61000854c","authors":["Jorge Lujan-Hernandez","Luca Lancerotto","Christoph Nabzdyk","Kazi Zayn Hassan","Giorgio Giatsidis","Roger K Khouri","Michael S Chin","Franco Bassetto","Janice F Lalikos","Dennis P Orgill","Lujan-Hernandez, Jorge","Lancerotto, Luca","Nabzdyk, Christoph","Hassan, Kazi Zayn","Giatsidis, Giorgio","Khouri, Roger K.
