An example of interhemispheric cooperation is visual spatial perception. During this process, visual information from each hemisphere is integrated because each half of the visual field predominantly projects to the contralateral visual cortex. Both egocentric and allocentric coordinates can be employed for visual spatial representation, but they activate different areas in primate cerebral hemispheres. Recent studies have determined that egocentric representation affects the reaction time of allocentric perception; furthermore, this influence is asymmetric between the two visual hemifields. The egocentric-allocentric incompatibility effect and its asymmetry between the two hemispheres can produce this phenomenon. Using an allocentric position judgment task, we found that this incompatibility effect was reduced, and its asymmetry was eliminated on an attentional task rather than a neutral task. Visual attention might activate cortical areas that process conflicting information, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, and balance the asymmetry between the two hemispheres. Attention may enhance and balance this interhemispheric cooperation because this imbalance may also be caused by the asymmetric cooperation of each hemisphere in spatial perception.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Meijian Wang","Xiuhai Wang","Lingyan Xue","Dan Huang","Yao Chen"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep19190","first_seen_on":"2016-01-20T00:45:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1453250724,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep19190"],"pmcid":"PMC4725350","pmid":"26758349","pubdate":"2016-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neuroscience","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cognitive neuroscience","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Attention","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Human behaviour","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Visual attention modulates the asymmetric influence of each cerebral hemisphere on spatial perception","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visual-attention-modulates-asymmetric-influence-each-cerebral-hemisphere-spatial-perception"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997887,"mean":6.2543742573087,"rank":6007461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997887,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315481,"mean":9.2020810637756,"rank":258612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315481,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25230,"mean":14.426275714456,"rank":21462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25230,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2844,"mean":16.573423848048,"rank":2393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2844,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Linguistics":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1},"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PavelProsselkov\/statuses\/689609637679620097","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5014084],"posted_on":"2016-01-20T00:45:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Pavel Prosselkov","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Pavel_Prosselkov","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/690470426057805825\/3WvSBd05_normal.jpg","description":"Interested in genotype-phenotype interactions, affecting cognitive traits, their acquisition and evolution.
