Existing solutions for deep sea robotic manipulation have historically been driven by the oil industry, resulting in destructive interactions with undersea life. Soft material robotics relies on compliant materials that are inherently impedance matched to natural environments and to soft or fragile organisms. We demonstrate design principles for soft robot end effectors, bench-top characterization of their grasping performance, and conclude by describing in situ testing at mesophotic depths. The result is the first use of soft robotics in the deep sea for the nondestructive sampling of benthic fauna.","authors":["GallowayKevin C."],"doi":"10.1089\/soro.2015.0019","first_seen_on":"2016-01-20T21:16:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2169-5172","2169-5180"],"issue":"1","journal":"Soft Robotics","last_mentioned_on":1492632885,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/soro.2015.0019","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/soro.2015.0019","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/10.1089\/soro.2015.0019","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1089\/soro.2015.0019","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/soro.2015.0019"],"pmid":"27625917","pubdate":"2016-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert Inc","title":"Soft Robotic Grippers for Biological Sampling on Deep Reefs","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/soft-robotic-grippers-biological-sampling-deep-reefs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":154.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":154.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
