Histopathological examination of cardiac tissues after infection showed a gradual increase of myocardial injury to the maximum degree at 8 dpi (days post infection), followed by a recovery process with reduced viral replication. We also measured expression changes of innate immune genes in heart after 4, 8 and 12 days of infection using innate immune real-time PCR array. The results showed expression alterations in many Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) genes upon CVB3 infection, which activated multiple important signaling pathways during recovery process. The expression of TLRs, RLRs, PKR and cytokines were strongly induced and reached the peak at 4 dpi in early myocarditis stage, followed by a gradual reduction in recovery stage, during which the levels were even lower than normal at 12 dpi. The strong correlation between cardiac histopathology score and chemokine expression level suggested that the chemokines might play a role in pathological changes during early myocarditis stage. In addition, we also found that both cell survival signaling pathways (AKT1, p38MAPK) and antiviral signaling pathways (IKK\u03b1\/\u03b2\/\u03b5) were activated and promoted the recovery during late myocarditis stage. Altogether, our observations improved the understanding of formation and progression of the pathological lesions, as well as the repair mechanism for acute viral myocarditis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003708","authors":["Yao, Hai-Lan","Song, Juan","Sun, Peng","Song, Qin-Qin","Sheng, Lin-Jun","Chi, Miao-Miao","Han, Jun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.virusres.2016.01.003","first_seen_on":"2016-01-19T12:24:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7492"],"journal":"Virus Research","last_mentioned_on":1453206225,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26779987?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26779987","pubdate":"2016-01-19T22:00:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Gene expression analysis during recovery process indicates the mechanism for innate immune injury and repair from Coxsackievirus B3-induced myocarditis.","type":"article","volume":"213","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-expression-analysis-during-recovery-process-indicates-mechanism-innate-immune-injury-repair-cox"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6992211,"mean":6.2499931892752,"rank":6002051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6992211,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314572,"mean":9.1974625060795,"rank":257823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314572,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":865,"mean":1.8581087962963,"rank":643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":865,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.1962264150943,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
