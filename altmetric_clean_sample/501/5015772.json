Subjects were administered the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and clinical assessments of spatial working memory, followed by an MRI scan and fMRI in spatial memory task state.\nStatistically significant differences between PSQI and spatial working memory were observed between PI patients and controls (p < 0.01). Activation of neural networks related to spatial memory task state in the PI group was observed at the left temporal lobe, left occipital lobe and right frontal lobe. Lower levels of activation were observed in the left parahippocampal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral temporal cortex, frontal cortex and superior parietal lobule.\nParticipants with PI exhibited characteristic abnormalities in the neural network connectivity related to spatial working memory. These results may be indicative of an underlying pathological mechanism related to spatial working memory deterioration in PI, analogous to recently described mechanisms in other mental health disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002861","authors":["Li, Yongli","Liu, Liya","Wang, Enfeng","Zhang, Hongju","Dou, Shewei","Tong, Li","Cheng, Jingliang","Chen, Chuanliang","Shi, Dapeng"],"doi":"10.1159\/000443372","first_seen_on":"2016-01-20T10:08:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1421-9913"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"European Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1453284440,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26784899"],"pmid":"26784899","pubdate":"2016-01-20T22:00:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Abnormal Neural Network of Primary Insomnia: Evidence from Spatial Working Memory Task fMRI.","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abnormal-neural-network-primary-insomnia-evidence-spatial-working-memory-task-fmri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997887,"mean":6.2543742573087,"rank":5230640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997887,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315481,"mean":9.2021647457839,"rank":216626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315481,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":392,"mean":3.4167774936061,"rank":285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":392,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.9538571428571,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
