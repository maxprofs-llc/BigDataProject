A significant between-group effect on balance favoring exercise was observed at 4\u00a0months (BBS=4.2, 95% CI=1.8-6.6). In interaction analyses, exercise effects differed\u00a0significantly between dementia types. Positive between-group exercise effects were found in participants with non-Alzheimer's dementia according to the FIM at 7\u00a0months and BI and BBS at 4 and 7\u00a0months.\nIn older people with mild to moderate dementia living in residential care facilities, a 4-month high-intensity functional exercise program appears to slow decline in ADL independence and improve balance, albeit only in participants with non-Alzheimer's dementia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5a","authors":["Toots, Annika","Littbrand, H\u00e5kan","Lindel\u00f6f, Nina","Wiklund, Robert","Holmberg, Henrik","Nordstr\u00f6m, Peter","Lundin\u2010Olsson, Lillemor","Gustafson, Yngve","Rosendahl, Erik","Lundin-Olsson, Lillemor"],"doi":"10.1111\/jgs.13880","endpage":"64","first_seen_on":"2016-01-20T12:24:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1532-5415"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","last_mentioned_on":1478182227,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.13880\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jgs.13880","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jgs.13880#.Vp-xbxViBSs.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jgs.13880#.VqELNfjNff5.facebook","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jgs.13880","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jgs.13880#.VqELUMOAJWh.twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26782852","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26782852?utm_content=bufferd6410&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jgs.13880#.Vqv0laKJWNA.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.13880\/full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26782852?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.13880\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4722852","pmid":"26782852","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"55","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Effects of a High\u2010Intensity Functional Exercise Program on Dependence in Activities of Daily Living and Balance in Older Adults with Dementia","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-highintensity-functional-exercise-program-dependence-activities-daily-living-balance-older-a-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":79.2,"score_history":{"1y":4.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":79.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7639268,"mean":6.5692022176954,"rank":94196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7545086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7639268,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323933,"mean":9.3333122075001,"rank":7096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":316834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323933,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3455,"mean":12.391497973364,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":3365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3455,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":30.515564102564,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":5,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
