The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral coenzyme Q10 supplementation on pro-inflammatory factors and adiponectin in mildly hypertensive patients.\nThis 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out during 2012 - 2013 in Yazd. Sixty mildly hypertensive patients were randomly divided into two groups: placebo (PG, n = 30) and coenzyme Q10 (QG, n = 30). The QG was given 1 capsule containing 100 mg Q10 per day. The PG was given 1 capsule of the same size and color as the Q10 capsules, but it contained 100 mg of lactose. Plasma pro-inflammatory factors (IL6, IL2, and TNF-\u03b1), adiponectin, and hs-CRP were determined before and after the intervention.\nThe mean enhancement in adiponectin of QG was significantly higher than PG (from 21.1 \u00b1 14.5 to 24.2 \u00b1 15.5 ng\/ml, P = 0.04). Significant declines in the median of IL6 (from 23 to 16 pg\/ml, P = 0.001) and in the mean of hs-CRP were also observed in QG after intervention (from 3.53 \u00b1 3.36 to 2.62 \u00b1 2.51 mg\/L, P = 0.03). In the two groups, no significant statistical changes were seen in the median of TNF-\u03b1 and IL2.\nDaily supplementation of 100 mg coenzyme Q10 can be effective in decreasing some pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL6 and hs-CRP, and in increasing adiponectin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61c3cf058f6100077fd","authors":["Bagheri Nesami, Nasim","Mozaffari-Khosravi, Hassan","Najarzadeh, Azadeh","Salehifar, Ebrahim","Nasim Bagheri Nesami"],"doi":"10.1024\/0300-9831\/a000234","first_seen_on":"2016-01-20T18:46:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0300-9831","1664-2821"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"International Journal for Vitamin and Nutrition Research","last_mentioned_on":1469095801,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26780394","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1024\/0300-9831\/a000234"],"pmid":"26780394","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"The Effect of Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation on Pro-Inflammatory Factors and Adiponectin in Mildly Hypertensive Patients: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-coenzyme-q10-supplementation-proinflammatory-factors-adiponectin-mildly-hypertensive-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088508,"mean":6.8823654995833,"rank":3686427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4321505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088508,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":329151,"mean":9.4843088986779,"rank":136195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":187240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":329151,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229,"mean":6.324,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
