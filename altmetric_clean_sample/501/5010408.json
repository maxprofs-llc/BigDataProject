However, clinical use of EPO is limited due to thrombotic risk. Carbamylated EPO (cEPO), devoid of thrombotic risk, has been proposed as a novel neuroprotective and neurotrophic agent although the molecular mechanisms of cEPO remain incomplete. Here, we show a previously unidentified role of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) in the actions of EPO and cEPO. EPO and cEPO regulate the HDAC5 phosphorylation at two critical sites, Ser259 and Ser498 through a protein kinase D (PKD) dependent pathway. In addition, EPO and cEPO rapidly stimulates nuclear export of HDAC5 in rat hippocampal neurons which expressing HDAC5-GFP. Consequently, EPO and cEPO enhanced the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) target gene expression. Taken together, our results reveal that EPO and cEPO mediate MEF2 target gene expression via the regulation of HDAC5 phosphorylation at Ser259\/498, and suggest that HDAC5 could be a potential mechanism contributing to the therapeutic actions of EPO and cEPO.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Jo, Hye-Ryeong","Kim, Yong-Seok","Son, Hyeon"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2016.01.039","first_seen_on":"2016-01-19T11:07:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2104"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1453201585,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26777998?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26777998","pubdate":"2016-01-19T22:01:27+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Erythropoietin and carbamylated erythropoietin promote histone deacetylase 5 phosphorylation and nuclear export in rat hippocampal neurons.","type":"article","volume":"470","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/erythropoietin-carbamylated-erythropoietin-promote-histone-deacetylase-5-phosphorylation-nuclear-exp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6992211,"mean":6.2499931892752,"rank":6001936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6992211,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314572,"mean":9.1973714296611,"rank":257752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314572,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7736,"mean":2.713592760181,"rank":6617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7736,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313,"mean":1.8577692307692,"rank":200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MltplSclppr\/statuses\/689403531732746240","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5010408],"posted_on":"2016-01-19T11:06:25+00:00","author":{"name":"MS Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/599614030790008833\/7IuEjHC7_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"MltplSclppr","tweeter_id":"3262004991","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":211},"tweet_id":"689403531732746240"}]}}
