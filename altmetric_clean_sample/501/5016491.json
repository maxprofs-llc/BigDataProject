One hundred and thirty women were enrolled. Fifty pregnant women with polyhydramnios were categorized as the case group, and 80 pregnant women with normal amniotic fluid were categorized as the control group. The causes of polyhydramnios and the pregnancy outcomes were analyzed. Two cases had chromosomal abnormalities, seven had severe \u03b1-thalassemia, 15 had fetal anomalies, four had maternal-fetal diseases and 22 had unexplained idiopathic polyhydramnios. Significantly, higher occurrences of cesarean section, preterm birth, fetal anomaly, fetal distress, fetal macrosomia and female fetuses occurred in patients with polyhydramnios than in patients without polyhydramnios. Polyhydramnios is associated with a higher occurrence of adverse perinatal outcomes. Intensive monitoring of the maternal-fetal condition and prenatal diagnosis is important in patients with polyhydramnios.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003c7a","authors":["Li-Ling Liu"],"doi":"10.3109\/15513815.2015.1122127","first_seen_on":"2016-01-20T11:38:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1551-3823"],"issue":"1","journal":"Fetal & Pediatric Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1454682215,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/15513815.2015.1122127"],"pmid":"26720631","pubdate":"2016-01-21T22:22:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology","pediatrics"],"title":"Prenatal Diagnosis and Pregnancy Outcome Analysis of Polyhydramnios","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prenatal-diagnosis-pregnancy-outcome-analysis-polyhydramnios"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7103144,"mean":6.3016585108842,"rank":3280824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3764043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7103144,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316860,"mean":9.2371311403492,"rank":147474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":166050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316860,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":1.2717391304348,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.91875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
