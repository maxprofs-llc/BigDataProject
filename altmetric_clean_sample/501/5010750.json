We also review the key pieces of primary research undertaken in the past year and how these affect the use of smoothened inhibitors in a clinical setting.\nMedium term follow-up (30 months) of patients treated with vismodegib shows an improvement in response rates for patients with laBCC. The safety profile of vismodegib demonstrated in the original ERIVANCE study has been replicated in a larger patient cohort in a repeat study. Sonidegib is a new smoothened inhibitor currently under investigation for treatment of laBCC, which demonstrates a comparable safety profile to vismodegib. The side-effects of smoothened inhibitors appear related to both dose and duration of treatment. The durability of response to vismodegib is uncertain, but has been observed to last for over a year following discontinuation of treatment.\nThe understanding of the efficacy and safety of vismodegib has improved since its introduction in 2012. A broadening evidence base supports its use as a valid treatment for laBCC. However, questions remain as to how to integrate its use into existing pathways for treating laBCC and its long-term efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005865","authors":["Khoo, Andre B S","Ali, Faisal R","Lear, John T"],"doi":"10.1097\/cco.0000000000000259","first_seen_on":"2016-01-19T11:27:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1531-703X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Current opinion in oncology","last_mentioned_on":1453202841,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26780190?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26780190","pubdate":"2016-01-19T22:00:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Defining locally advanced basal cell carcinoma and integrating smoothened inhibitors into clinical practice.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/defining-locally-advanced-basal-cell-carcinoma-integrating-smoothened-inhibitors-clinical-practice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6992211,"mean":6.2499931892752,"rank":3456486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2027335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6992211,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314572,"mean":9.1974167294503,"rank":163218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":117211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314572,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":423,"mean":1.6531090047393,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":423,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.1194444444444,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dermatologyf\/statuses\/689408802962038788","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5010750],"posted_on":"2016-01-19T11:27:21+00:00","author":{"name":"dermatologyf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2046835740\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Dermatology News","id_on_source":"dermatologyf","tweeter_id":"546505902","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":57},"tweet_id":"689408802962038788"}]}}
