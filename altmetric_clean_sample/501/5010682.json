The long-term aim of the prototype is a breast health monitoring application. The system operates using multistatic time-domain pulsed radar, with 16 flexible antennas embedded into a bra. Unlike the previously reported, table-based prototype with a rigid cup-like holder, the wearable one requires no immersion medium and enables simple localization of breast surface. In comparison with the table-based prototype, the wearable one is also significantly more cost-effective and has a smaller footprint. To demonstrate the improved functionality of the wearable prototype, we here report the outcome of daily testing of the new, wearable prototype on a healthy volunteer over a 28-day period. The resulting data (both signals and reconstructed images) is compared to that obtained with our table-based prototype. We show that the use of the wearable prototype has improved the quality of collected volunteer data by every investigated measure. This work demonstrates the proof-of-concept for a wearable breast health monitoring array, which can be further optimized in the future for use with patients with various breast sizes and tissue densities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a63","authors":["Porter, Emily","Bahrami, Hadi","Santorelli, Adam","Gosselin, Benoit","Rusch, Leslie","Popovich, Milica"],"doi":"10.1109\/tmi.2016.2518489","first_seen_on":"2016-01-19T11:22:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1558-254X"],"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","last_mentioned_on":1453202537,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26780788?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26780788","pubdate":"2016-01-19T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"A Wearable Microwave Antenna Array for Time-Domain Breast Tumor Screening.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wearable-microwave-antenna-array-timedomain-breast-tumor-screening"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6992211,"mean":6.2499931892752,"rank":5225922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6992211,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314572,"mean":9.1974021063605,"rank":215940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314572,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270,"mean":2.3012639405204,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.771875,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
