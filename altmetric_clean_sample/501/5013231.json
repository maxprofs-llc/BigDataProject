The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HMPV in the Union Territory of Puducherry, India, as part of National Influenza Surveillance Programme.\nFrom November 2011 to December 2013, a total of 447 nasopharyngeal samples were collected from patients with acute respiratory infections and tested for HMPV RNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nHMPV was identified in 23\/447 (5%) samples with 11\/23 in the age group of 14-30 years. Most of the HMPV infections were mild with no fatalities. Two patients were co-infected with the respiratory syncytial virus and one with influenza B virus. The seasonal distribution showed increasing HMPV infection cases in rainy months except for a peak in summer of 2012. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of the nucleoprotein gene of one HMPV strain showed a high degree of sequence identity with Indian strains obtained during 2006 and 2011.\nThis study shows that HMPV infection is more common in adults than in children. Sequence homology suggests the circulation of closely related HMPV strains within the country.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aac","authors":["Nandhini, G","Sujatha, S","Jain, N","Dhodapkar, R","Tamilarasu, K","Krishnamurthy, S","Biswal, N"],"doi":"10.4103\/0255-0857.174117","first_seen_on":"2016-01-19T19:39:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1998-3646"],"issue":"1","journal":"Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1453232344,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26776115?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26776115","pubdate":"2016-01-19T22:02:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Prevalence of Human metapneumovirus infection among patients with influenza-like illness: Report from a Tertiary Care Centre, Southern India.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-human-metapneumovirus-infection-among-patients-influenzalike-illness-report-tertiary-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6992211,"mean":6.2499931892752,"rank":5225984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6992211,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314572,"mean":9.1975539003911,"rank":215968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314572,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272,"mean":1.3300221402214,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.4240930232558,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
