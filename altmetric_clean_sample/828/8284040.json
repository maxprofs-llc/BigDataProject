Here, we report the draft genome sequence of Aurantiochytrium sp. T66 (ATCC PRA-276), with a size of 43\u00a0Mbp, and 11,683 predicted protein-coding sequences. The data has been deposited at DDBJ\/EMBL\/Genbank under the accession LNGJ00000000. The genome sequence will contribute new insight into DHA biosynthesis and regulation, providing a basis for metabolic engineering of thraustochytrids.","altmetric_jid":"5216115b3cf058827c00001c","authors":["Bin Liu","Helga Ertesv\u00e5g","Inga Marie Aasen","Olav Vadstein","Trygve Brautaset","Tonje Marita Bjerkan Heggeset"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gdata.2016.04.013","endpage":"116","first_seen_on":"2016-05-26T11:06:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["22135960","2213-5960"],"journal":"Genomics Data","last_mentioned_on":1464260406,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2213596016300599"],"pmcid":"PMC4873566","pmid":"27222814","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"115","title":"Draft genome sequence of the docosahexaenoic acid producing thraustochytrid Aurantiochytrium sp.
