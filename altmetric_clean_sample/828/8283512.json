The synthesized iNGR and NGR peptides were conjugated with DOTA and then labeled with (68)Ga. (68)Ga-iNGR and (68)Ga-NGR were compared in the performance of the in vitro stability, partition coefficient, binding affinity, cell uptake analysis, in vivo microPET imaging, and biodistribution studies in CD13-positive HT-1080 and CD13-negative HT-29 cell lines. The in vitro results revealed that both probes exhibited high radiochemical purity and stability, and no significant difference between two probes was observed in terms of the binding affinity to CD13. In vivo microPET\/CT imaging showed that the uptake of (68)Ga-iNGR in HT-1080 tumor was significantly higher than that of (68)Ga-NGR. Moreover, tumor (68)Ga-iNGR uptake could be completely blocked by cold NGR and partially blocked by neutralizing NRP-1 antibody. We concluded that (68)Ga-iNGR has a higher tumor uptake and better tumor retention than (68)Ga-NGR through NRP-1, indicating that CendR motif modification is a promising method for improving NGR peptide performance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Zhao, Mingxuan","Yang, Weidong","Zhang, Mingru","Li, Guoquan","Wang, Shengjun","Wang, Zhe","Ma, Xiaowei","Kang, Fei","Wang, Jing"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13277-016-5068-0","first_seen_on":"2016-05-26T10:44:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1423-0380","1010-4283"],"issue":"9","journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1464259463,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27220318?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27220318","pubdate":"2016-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Evaluation of 68Ga-labeled iNGR peptide with tumor-penetrating motif for microPET imaging of CD13-positive tumor xenografts","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-68galabeled-ingr-peptide-tumorpenetrating-motif-micropet-imaging-cd13positive-tumor-xenog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7811999,"mean":6.6309711159621,"rank":6766444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7811999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268965,"mean":11.415894194018,"rank":224059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268965,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1878,"mean":1.2618273841236,"rank":1126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1878,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":0.88472222222222,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
