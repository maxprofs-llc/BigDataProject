Such skills can help to greatly improve patient care as well as enhance organisational effectiveness and productivity. The central involvement of professional bodies such as the UK Faculty of Medical Leadership and Management, and the establishment of medical fellowship schemes, have provided a solid foundation for a new generation of aspiring medical leaders but there is still a long way to go to achieve a higher degree of professionalism for clinical leadership in the UK. The evidence base is weak such that integrated efforts by clinicians and management academics have much to offer in achieving the vision of socially responsible, clinically relevant and research informed medical leadership training.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51d3cf058f610003973","authors":["Yiannis Kyratsis","Kirsten Armit","Azra Zyada","Peter Lees"],"doi":"10.1177\/1039856216635909","endpage":"242","first_seen_on":"2016-05-26T09:40:10+00:00","issns":["1440-1665"],"issue":"3","journal":"Australasian Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1464253802,"links":["http:\/\/apy.sagepub.com\/content\/24\/3\/240.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/apy.sagepub.com\/content\/24\/3\/240.full.pdf","pmid":"26944517","pubdate":"2016-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"240","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Medical leadership and management in the United Kingdom","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medical-leadership-management-united-kingdom-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7811999,"mean":6.6309711159621,"rank":6766447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7811999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268966,"mean":11.415864577175,"rank":224065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268966,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":885,"mean":2.5228936651584,"rank":564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":885,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.6629032258065,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
