Treatment wise, these patients were randomly divided into two groups. In group\u00a01, patients underwent SRP and were instructed to rinse with 10 mL of an EOBM twice daily for 30 days, whereas those in group\u00a02 underwent SRP and were instructed to rinse with 10 mL of water twice daily for 30 days. Whole saliva samples were collected at baseline and after 40 days of treatment. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nAt baseline, whole salivary IgG levels were comparable among patients in groups 1 (60.5 \u00b1\u00a05.5 mg\/dL) and 2 (57.3 \u00b1\u00a02.4 mg\/dL). After 40 days of follow-up, there is a significant decrease in whole salivary IgG levels among patients in group\u00a01 (7.2 \u00b1\u00a02.4 mg\/dL) as compared to those in group\u00a02 (26.6 \u00b1\u00a04.6 mg\/dL) (P < 0.001).\nSRP, when performed with adjunct use of an EOBM, is more effective in reducing whole salivary IgG levels as compared to when SRP is performed without adjunct use of an EOBM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a71","authors":[" Mohammad Alshehri "],"doi":"10.1556\/1646.7.2015.4.1","first_seen_on":"2015-12-19T14:50:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2061-1617"],"issue":"4","journal":"Interventional Medicine and Applied Science","last_mentioned_on":1452920671,"links":["http:\/\/www.akademiai.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1556\/1646.7.2015.4.1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26767118\/?i=2&from=alshehri%20m"],"pmcid":"PMC4701163","pmid":"26767118","pubdate":"2016-01-15T22:00:07+00:00","title":"Impact of scaling and root planing with adjunct essential-oil-based mouthwash usage on whole salivary IgG levels in patients with periodontal inflammation.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-scaling-root-planning-adjunct-essentialoilbased-mouthwash-usage-whole-salivary-igg-levels-pat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6978736,"mean":6.2380718316401,"rank":2841945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4055327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6978736,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295474,"mean":8.8260160285371,"rank":112406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":178593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295474,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.8675,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.6,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SA":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/malshehri_dr\/statuses\/678225906855518208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4898358],"posted_on":"2015-12-19T14:50:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Mohammed Alshehri","url":"http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/drmohammedalshehri","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/892486082704670720\/JMcck1Mc_normal.jpg","description":"\u0625\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u064a \u062a\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0646\u0627\u0646 I @ksumedicalcity, \u0639\u0636\u0648 \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629 I @DentalSaudi - \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f Researcher & Inventor (DermaDent) mohaalshehri@ksu.edu.sa","id_on_source":"malshehri_dr","tweeter_id":"4149921013","geo":{"lt":24.68773,"ln":46.72185,"country":"SA"},"followers":7150},"tweet_id":"678225906855518208"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dr_mzs\/statuses\/680813548554039297","license":"gnip","rt":["malshehri_dr"],"citation_ids":[4898358],"posted_on":"2015-12-26T18:12:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Mohammed","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/876095889135239170\/r9BEJj3u_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"dr_mzs","tweeter_id":"16155397","geo":{"lt":24.68773,"ln":46.72185,"country":"SA"},"followers":9511},"tweet_id":"680813548554039297"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/malshehri_dr\/statuses\/688225296349175808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4898358],"posted_on":"2016-01-16T05:04:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Mohammed Alshehri","url":"http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/drmohammedalshehri","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/892486082704670720\/JMcck1Mc_normal.jpg","description":"\u0625\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u064a \u062a\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0646\u0627\u0646 I @ksumedicalcity, \u0639\u0636\u0648 \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629 I @DentalSaudi - \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f Researcher & Inventor (DermaDent) mohaalshehri@ksu.edu.sa","id_on_source":"malshehri_dr","tweeter_id":"4149921013","geo":{"lt":24.68773,"ln":46.72185,"country":"SA"},"followers":7150},"tweet_id":"688225296349175808"}]}}
