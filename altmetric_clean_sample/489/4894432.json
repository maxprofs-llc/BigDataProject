Due to their unique and complex chemical structures and many interesting physicochemical and rheological properties with novel functionality, the microbial EPSs find wide range of commercial applications in various fields of the economy such as food, feed, packaging, chemical, textile, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industry, agriculture, and medicine. EPSs are mainly associated with high-value applications, and they have received considerable research attention over recent decades with their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and both environmental and human compatibility. However, only a few microbial EPSs have achieved to be used commercially due to their high production costs. The emerging need to overcome economic hurdles and the increasing significance of microbial EPSs in industrial and medical biotechnology call for the elucidation of the interrelations between metabolic pathways and EPS biosynthesis mechanism in order to control and hence enhance its microbial productivity. Moreover, a better understanding of biosynthesis mechanism is a significant issue for improvement of product quality and properties and also for the design of novel strains. Therefore, a systems-based approach constitutes an important step toward understanding the interplay between metabolism and EPS biosynthesis and further enhances its metabolic performance for industrial application. In this review, primarily the microbial EPSs, their biosynthesis mechanism, and important factors for their production will be discussed. After this brief introduction, recent literature on the application of omics technologies and systems biology tools for the improvement of production yields will be critically evaluated. Special focus will be given to EPSs with high market value such as xanthan, levan, pullulan, and dextran.","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b4567","authors":["Ates, Ozlem"],"doi":"10.3389\/fbioe.2015.00200","first_seen_on":"2015-12-18T14:14:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2296-4185"],"journal":"Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1450861206,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fbioe.2015.00200\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fbioe.2015.00200\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4683990","pmid":"26734603","pubdate":"2015-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Systems Biology of Microbial Exopolysaccharides Production","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systems-biology-microbial-exopolysaccharides-production"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6818838,"mean":6.1901666501164,"rank":3042380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3719111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6818838,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291811,"mean":8.7624270107259,"rank":131528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":157208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291811,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":2.3511367292225,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.2460526315789,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
