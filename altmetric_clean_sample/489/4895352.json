We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality by presence or absence of anxiety\/depression and evaluated potential mediators. We calculated the population attributable risk of mortality for anxiety\/depression.\nPersons with anxiety\/depression died 7.9years earlier than other persons. At a population level, 3.5% of deaths were attributable to anxiety\/depression. Adjusting for demographic factors, anxiety\/depression was associated with an elevated risk of mortality [HR=1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.40, 1.84]. Chronic diseases and health behaviors explained much of the elevated risk. Adjusting for demographic factors, people with past-year contact with a mental health professional did not demonstrate excess mortality associated with anxiety\/depression while those without contact did.\nAnxiety\/depression presents a mortality burden at both individual and population levels. Our findings are consistent with targeting health behaviors and physical illnesses as strategies for reducing this excess mortality among people with anxiety\/depression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002937","authors":["Pratt, Laura A","Druss, Benjamin G","Manderscheid, Ronald W","Walker, Elizabeth Reisinger","Laura A.
