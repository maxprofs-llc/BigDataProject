Here, we show that T helper 17 (Th17) cells induced robust TLTs within the brain meninges that were associated with local demyelination during experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Th17-cell-induced TLTs were underpinned by a network of stromal cells producing extracellular matrix proteins and chemokines, enabling leukocytes to reside within, rather than simply transit through, the meninges. Within the CNS, interactions between lymphotoxin \u03b1\u03b2 (LT\u03b1\u03b2) on Th17 cells and LT\u03b2R on meningeal radio-resistant cells were necessary for the propagation of de novo interleukin-17 responses, and activated T\u00a0cells from MS patients expressed elevated levels of LT\u03b2R ligands. Therefore, input from both Th17 cells and the lymphotoxin pathway induce the formation of an immune-competent stromal cell niche in the meninges.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a95","authors":["Pikor, Natalia B","Astarita, Jillian L","Summers-Deluca, Leslie","Galicia, Georgina","Qu, Joy","Ward, Lesley A","Armstrong, Susan","Dominguez, Claudia X","Malhotra, Deepali","Heiden, Brendan","Kay, Robert","Castanov, Valera","Touil, Hanane","Boon, Louis","O'Connor, Paul","Bar-Or, Amit","Prat, Alexandre","Ramaglia, Valeria","Ludwin, Samuel","Turley, Shannon J","Gommerman, Jennifer L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.immuni.2015.11.010","endpage":"1173","first_seen_on":"2015-12-17T18:38:20+00:00","funders":["niehs","phs","cihr"],"issns":["1074-7613","1097-4180","10747613"],"issue":"6","journal":"Immunity","last_mentioned_on":1487548800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.immuni.2015.11.010","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1074761315004628","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26682987?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/immunity\/abstract\/S1074-7613%2815%2900462-8?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26682987"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1074761315004628\/pdf","pmid":"26682987","pubdate":"2015-12-20T11:14:20+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"1160","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Integration of Th17- and Lymphotoxin-Derived Signals Initiates Meningeal-Resident Stromal Cell Remodeling to Propagate Neuroinflammation","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/integration-th17-lymphotoxinderived-signals-initiates-meningealresident-stromal-cell-remodeling-prop"},"altmetric_score":{"score":80.054,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":80.054},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":108669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8135679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291561,"mean":9.1143941967346,"rank":6265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":285296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291561,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2178,"mean":12.588179145613,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":2120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2178,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":19.5294375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
