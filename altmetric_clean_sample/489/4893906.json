To balance the covariates between the two groups, a propensity case-matched analysis was developed to generate a matched sample, which included 76 patients in each arm.\nLocal tumour progression (p=0.005), intra-segmental recurrence (p=0.0001), and 5-year recurrence rates (80% vs. 60%; p=0.0014) were significantly higher in the ablation therapies group. The 5-year survival rate were 48% after ablation therapies and 69% after hepatic resection (p=0.0006). Multivariate analysis showed that MELD score, alpha-fetoprotein value, procedure category and intraoperative restaging were associated with survival, while the surgery was the only independent predictor of intra-hepatic recurrence.\nThe present study suggests that, if percutaneous ablation is not feasible, hepatic resection may be considered as a sound option in the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000712d","authors":["Santambrogio, Roberto","Bruno, Savino","Kluger, Michael D","Costa, Mara","Salceda, Juan","Belli, Andrea","Laurent, Alexis","Barabino, Matteo","Opocher, Enrico","Azoulay, Daniel","Cherqui, Daniel"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.dld.2015.11.010","first_seen_on":"2015-12-18T12:15:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-3562","1590-8658"],"journal":"Digestive and Liver Disease","last_mentioned_on":1450520745,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26675381?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26675381\/?i=33&from=liver%20cancer","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.dld.2015.11.010","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26675381\/?i=33&from=liver+cancer"],"pmid":"26675381","pubdate":"2015-12-18T22:00:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Laparoscopic ablation therapies or hepatic resection in cirrhotic patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laparoscopic-ablation-therapies-hepatic-resection-cirrhotic-patients-small-hepatocellular-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6792385,"mean":6.175626080326,"rank":5045358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":983533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6792385,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291198,"mean":8.7573572323889,"rank":197518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291198,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":619,"mean":2.5562718446602,"rank":307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":619,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.1035135135135,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
