It should be considered a reservoir that may induce serious infections. Indeed, Candidaspp. biofilms may be involved in the persistence or worsening of some chronic inflammatory diseases as well as in systemic infections, which may lead to high morbidity and mortality rates. New strategies are currently being explored, utilizing several synthetic compounds to prevent or fight these Candida biofilms. This article focuses on active synthetic compounds classified with regards to their modes of action: inhibition of early adherence phase, inhibition or control of biofilm maturation and finally elimination of already formed biofilms. Some of them show promise in fighting biofilm.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074e1","authors":["Girardot, Marion","Imbert, Christine"],"doi":"10.2217\/fmb.15.118","first_seen_on":"2015-12-18T11:30:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1746-0921"],"journal":"Future Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1450438206,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26673571?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26673571","pubdate":"2015-12-18T22:01:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Novel strategies against Candida biofilms: interest of synthetic compounds.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-strategies-against-candida-biofilms-interest-synthetic-compounds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6790336,"mean":6.1741602613112,"rank":5807099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6790336,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291128,"mean":8.7560604615854,"rank":235702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291128,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":474,"mean":3.2800338266385,"rank":406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":3.6934782608696,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/biofilmPapers\/statuses\/677813082568060929","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4893609],"posted_on":"2015-12-18T11:30:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Biofilm Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585213267288653824\/evf5BSKg_normal.jpg","description":"Stay on top of all the latest publications on Biofilm research curated from PubMed. #biofilm #microbiology #antibioticresistance.
