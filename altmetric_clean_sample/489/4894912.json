If this finding is consistent across studies, it raises important etiologic questions regarding factors responsible for this discrepancy. It also affects the likely public health burden of AD in the US in the future, as the non-Caucasian population becomes the majority.\nEstimate the AA\/CC rate ratio for AD incidence across all available studies.\nWe conducted a meta-analysis of population-based studies for the rate ratio (RR) of AD incidence for AAs versus CCs, after identifying six relevant studies from the literature. We calculated an AA\/CC rate ratio across all studies using inverse-variance weighting, and assessed inter-study heterogeneity. Using these incidence data, as well as data on survival after diagnosis, and on all-cause mortality, we also estimated the US prevalence of AD among AAs and CCs.\nThere were six population-based studies with data comparing AD incidence between AAs and CCs, with an estimated 370 AA and 640 CC incident cases. The meta-analysis RR showed that the AD rate for AAs was 64% higher than for CCs (RR\u200a=\u200a1.64 (95% CI 1.35-2.00)). We estimated the current US AD prevalence for ages 65-90 to be 5.5% for CCs, and 8.6% for AAs (prevalence ratio 1.56).\nAAs have an increased risk of incident and prevalent AD compared to CCs for reasons which are unknown, but are hypothesized to reflect biological, psychological, and socioeconomic factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Steenland, Kyle","Goldstein, Felicia C","Levey, Allan","Wharton, Whitney","Kyle Steenland","Felicia C.
