Despite early insights by the Greeks, phobias did not appear as a separate clinical phenomenon in Western medicine until the 17th century and has evolved substantially since. However, robust investigations attempting to decipher the clinical nature of phobias emerged in pre-modern times during the oft-overlooked Islamic Golden Era (9th-12th centuries); which overlapped with Europe's medieval period. An innovative attempt was made by the 9th century Muslim scholar, Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, in his medical manuscript \"Sustenance of the Body and Soul,\" to define phobias as a separate diagnostic entity. Al-Balkhi was one of the earliest to cluster psychological and physical symptoms of phobias under one category, \"al-Faza\u00e1\", and outline a specific management plan. We analyze al-Balkhi's description of phobias, according to the modern understanding of psychiatric classifications and symptomatology as described in the DSM-5.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8a","authors":["Awaad, Rania","Ali, Sara"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.janxdis.2015.11.003","first_seen_on":"2015-12-19T16:56:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["08876185","1873-7897"],"journal":"Journal of Anxiety Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1450544184,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0887618515300347&_version=1&md5=00c26151bb4022f77653571a4f2ddf4f"],"pmid":"26741063","pubdate":"2016-01-08T22:00:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"A Modern Conceptualization of Phobia in al-Balkhi's 9th Century Treatise: Sustenance of the Body and Soul ","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modern-conceptualization-phobia-albalkhis-9th-century-treatise-sustenance-body-soul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6792385,"mean":6.175626080326,"rank":5045362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":983504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6792385,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292732,"mean":8.7806095835425,"rank":198619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":55578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292732,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":749,"mean":3.5994946524064,"rank":545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":749,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":6.3612727272727,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
