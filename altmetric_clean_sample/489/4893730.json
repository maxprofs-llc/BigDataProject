Cassava roots rich in \u03b2-carotene are an important staple food for populations with risk of vitamin A deficiency. Cassava genotypes with high pro-vitamin A activity have been identified as a strategy to reduce the prevalence of deficiency of this vitamin. The data set was used for the construction of a descriptive model by chemometric analysis. The genotypes of yellow-fleshed roots were clustered by the higher concentrations of cis-\u03b2-carotene and lutein. Inversely, cream-fleshed roots genotypes were grouped precisely due to their lower concentrations of these pigments, as samples rich in lycopene (redfleshed) differed among the studied genotypes. The analytical approach (UV-Vis, HPLC, and chemometrics) used showed to be efficient for understanding the chemodiversity of cassava genotypes, allowing to classify them according to important features for human health and nutrition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9243cf058f61000dbee","authors":["Moresco, Rodolfo","Uarrota, Virg\u00edlio Gavicho","Pereira, Aline","Tomazzoli, Ma\u00edra Maciel","Nunes, Eduardo da C","Peruch, Luiz Augusto Martins","Gazzola, Jussara","Costa, Christopher","Rocha, Miguel","Maraschin, Marcelo"],"doi":"10.2390\/biecoll-jib-2015-280","first_seen_on":"2015-12-18T11:37:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1613-4516"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of integrative bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1474628118,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26673931?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26673931?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26673931","pubdate":"2015-12-18T22:01:16+00:00","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"UV-visible scanning spectrophotometry and chemometric analysis as tools for carotenoids analysis in cassava genotypes (Manihot esculenta Crantz).","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uvvisible-scanning-spectrophotometry-chemometric-analysis-tools-carotenoids-analysis-cassava-genotyp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":6391390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1144240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312079,"mean":9.0828106627185,"rank":213371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":54681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312079,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.3025185185185,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.78888888888889,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
