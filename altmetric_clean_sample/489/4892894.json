In recent years, the condition of non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has been defined, which includes some patients who are not considered \"true celiacs.\" We performed a comparative clinicopathological study of these three entities. We studied 31 GA, 48 CD and 37 NCGS patients, prospectively in the same center for a period of 7\u00a0years. The protocol study included two serological determinations for gluten sensitivity [anti-gliadin IgA and IgG (AGA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (TG) antibodies], HLA-DQ2 typing, and duodenal histological assessment. Demographics and investigative findings were compared. Females were 55\u00a0% in GA, 75\u00a0% in CD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and 47\u00a0% in NCGS (N.S.). GA patients were older (59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014\u00a0years) than CD (43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0years) and NCGS (41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0years) groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). AGA positivity was higher in GA (100\u00a0%) than in CD (48\u00a0%) groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but similar to NCGS patients (89\u00a0%; N.S.); TG positivity was lower in GA (3.2\u00a0%) than in CD (33.3\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but similar to NCGS (2.7\u00a0%; N.S.). DQ2 (+) was lower in GA (32.2\u00a0%) than in CD (89.6\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but similar to NCGS (29.7\u00a0%; N.S.). Lymphocytic enteritis (Marsh type 1) was lower in GA (9.6\u00a0%) than in CD (66.7\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but similar to NCGS (10.8\u00a0%; N.S.). The other gluten sensitivity-related characteristics measured were different to CD patients, but very close to NCGS. We conclude that GA patients are better classified within the NCGS group, than within CD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000772a","authors":["Rodrigo, Luis","Hern\u00e1ndez-Lahoz, Carlos","Lauret, Eugenia","Rodriguez-Pel\u00e1ez, Maria","Soucek, Miroslav","Ciccocioppo, Rachele","Kruzliak, Peter"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12026-015-8750-1","endpage":"564","first_seen_on":"2015-12-18T09:49:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-0755"],"issue":"2","journal":"Immunologic Research","last_mentioned_on":1473813160,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26676361","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12026-015-8750-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12026-015-8750-1.pdf","pmid":"26676361","pubdate":"2015-12-18T22:00:28+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Allergology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"558","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Gluten ataxia is better classified as non-celiac gluten sensitivity than as celiac disease: a comparative clinical study","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gluten-ataxia-better-classified-nonceliac-gluten-sensitivity-celiac-disease-comparative-clinical-stu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":1787650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6581026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311785,"mean":9.0748450080822,"rank":74658,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":236469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311785,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":391,"mean":6.1030102564103,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":391,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":0.94864864864865,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":6,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":5,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":10,"Neuroscience":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":2,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2,"PT":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"NO":1,"PL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PaulWhiteleyPhD\/statuses\/677787587449368577","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4892894],"posted_on":"2015-12-18T09:48:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Paul Whiteley","url":"http:\/\/questioning-answers.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000344449848\/35f9d576889f4cf18b0bcf1f367afa4f_normal.jpeg","description":"Autism research, research blogging & tweeting & health science stuff.
