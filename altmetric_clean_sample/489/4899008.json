Previous work has shown that the final 4 residues of the \u03b14 subunit are required for potentiation. However, receptors containing the \u03b12 subunit are not potentiated although it has these 4 residues, and only one amino acid difference in the C-terminal tail (FLAGMI vs. WLAGMI). Previous work had indicated that the tryptophan residue was involved in binding an analog of \u03b2EST, but not in potentiation by \u03b2EST. To determine the structural basis for the loss of potentiation we analyzed data from chimeric subunits, which indicated that the major factor underlying the difference between \u03b12 and \u03b14 is the tryptophan\/phenylalanine difference, while the N-terminal extracellular domain is a less significant factor. When the tryptophan in \u03b14 was mutated, both phenylalanine and tyrosine conferred lower potentiation while lysine and leucine did not. The reduction reflected a reduced maximal magnitude of potentiation, indicating that the tryptophan is involved in transduction of steroid effects. The regions of the \u03b14 N-terminal extracellular domain involved in potentiation lie near the agonist-binding pocket, rather than close to the membrane or the C-terminal tail, and appear to be involved in transduction rather than binding. These observations indicate that the C-terminal region is involved in both steroid binding (AGMI residues) and transduction (W). The role of the N-terminus appears to be independent of the C-terminal tryptophan and likely reflects an influence on conformational changes caused during channel activation by agonist and potentiation by estradiol.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Xiaochun Jin","Joe Henry Steinbach","Jin, Xiaochun","Steinbach, Joe Henry"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0144631","first_seen_on":"2015-12-19T20:50:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1467296404,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0144631","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26684647?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26684647?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0144631.PDF","pmcid":"PMC4684330","pmid":"26684647","pubdate":"2015-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0144631","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Potentiation of Neuronal Nicotinic Receptors by 17\u03b2-Estradiol: Roles of the Carboxy-Terminal and the Amino-Terminal Extracellular Domains","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potentiation-neuronal-nicotinic-receptors-17%CE%B2estradiol-roles-carboxyterminal-aminoterminal-extracell"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":3392984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4464116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":307745,"mean":8.9971514960484,"rank":113534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":188302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":307745,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111985,"mean":10.341981943849,"rank":46829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":62354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111985,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5002,"mean":11.028073585283,"rank":2087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5002,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CayleyAerospace\/statuses\/678316413694558208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4899008],"posted_on":"2015-12-19T20:50:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Chartered Engineer","url":"http:\/\/www.chartered-engineer-usa.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/527561411946229760\/XDhwvvH5_normal.jpeg","description":"Cayley Aerospace Inc is Washington State Licensed Chartered Engineering Certification corporation Approved with Federal US Govt,DGFT Govt of India & MBE with CA","id_on_source":"CayleyAerospace","tweeter_id":"2850346503","geo":{"lt":47.60621,"ln":-122.33207,"country":"US"},"followers":86},"tweet_id":"678316413694558208"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RochelClemans\/statuses\/704774625788456960","license":"gnip","rt":["CayleyAerospace"],"citation_ids":[4899008],"posted_on":"2016-03-01T21:05:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Rochel Clemans","url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1Kav8pk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/694162223879421952\/RBA8UDmZ_normal.jpg","description":"My life is perfect, even when it is not. http:\/\/bit.ly\/1Kav8pk","id_on_source":"RochelClemans","tweeter_id":"3419476149","geo":{"lt":42.97839,"ln":-78.79976,"country":"US"},"followers":1446},"tweet_id":"704774625788456960"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Xenpaper\/statuses\/748519774083158017","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4899008],"posted_on":"2016-06-30T14:13:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Xenpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/715888053840179200\/Cu3Oo1ci_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot of #Xenopus papers in #Pubmed.
