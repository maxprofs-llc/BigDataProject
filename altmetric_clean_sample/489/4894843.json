We analyzed the length of hospital stay by the proportional hazard model.\nA total of 172 patients were identified who were admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of AP. Of them, 62% (106\/172) were female. Except for urological malignancy, there was no significant difference between men and women in underlying disease. Out of 26 variables, univariate analysis in male showed that only urolithiasis (OR 1.75, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0294) was significantly associated with longer hospital stay, while septic shock (OR 3.18, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), urological malignancy (OR 2.94, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), age over 65 (OR 1.66, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and neurogenic bladder (OR 1.92, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) were all associated with longer hospital stay in female patients.\nThis is the first report to identify the risk factors for prolonged hospital stay for the patients who were admitted with AP in the Japanese population. The risk factors causing prolonged hospital stay were totally different between males and females. Reviewing the medical history based on sex gender might enable a clinician to predict the severity of acute pyelonephritis during the initial evaluation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df5","authors":["Risa Muneishi","Ryuta Tanimoto","Koichiro Wada","Philip Hsiao","Jun Eguchi","Motoo Araki","Toyohiko Watanabe","Yasutomo Nasu","Naoki Akebi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jiac.2015.11.007","first_seen_on":"2015-12-18T16:01:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1341-321X","1341321X","1437-7780"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Infection & Chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1450454462,"links":["http:\/\/www.jiac-j.com\/article\/S1341-321X%2815%2900264-0\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1341321X15002640&_version=1&md5=41860cd0a98134a1a274e37b9a9ffeb5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jiac-j.com\/article\/S1341321X15002640\/pdf","pmid":"26712583","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","drugtherapy"],"title":"The gender specific risk factors for prolonged hospitalization due to acute pyelonephritis in a Japanese tertiary emergency center","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gender-specific-risk-factors-prolonged-hospitalization-due-acute-pyelonephritis-japanese-tertiary-em"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6790336,"mean":6.1741602613112,"rank":5807123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6790336,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291129,"mean":8.7560482468192,"rank":235728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291129,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":365,"mean":1.1405384615385,"rank":245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":365,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.5423076923077,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Ph.
