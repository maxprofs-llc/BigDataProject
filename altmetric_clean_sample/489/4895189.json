Having established that genetic associations are shared between the 2 populations, we performed a meta-analysis testing which associations with WMHV in stroke-free populations are associated overall when combined with stroke populations.\nThere were no associations at genome-wide significance with WMHV in stroke patients. All previously reported genome-wide significant associations with WMHV in community populations shared direction of effect in stroke patients. In a meta-analysis of the genome-wide significant and suggestive loci (p < 5 \u00d7 10(-6)) from community populations (15 single nucleotide polymorphisms in total) and from stroke patients, 6 independent loci were associated with WMHV in both populations. Four of these are novel associations at the genome-wide level (rs72934505 [NBEAL1], p = 2.2 \u00d7 10(-8); rs941898 [EVL], p = 4.0 \u00d7 10(-8); rs962888 [C1QL1], p = 1.1 \u00d7 10(-8); rs9515201 [COL4A2], p = 6.9 \u00d7 10(-9)).\nGenetic associations with WMHV are shared in otherwise healthy individuals and patients with stroke, indicating common genetic susceptibility in cerebral small vessel disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Traylor, Matthew","Zhang, Cathy R","Adib-Samii, Poneh","Devan, William J","Parsons, Owen E","Lanfranconi, Silvia","Gregory, Sarah","Cloonan, Lisa","Falcone, Guido J","Radmanesh, Farid","Fitzpatrick, Kaitlin","Kanakis, Allison","Barrick, Thomas R","Moynihan, Barry","Lewis, Cathryn M","Boncoraglio, Giorgio B","Lemmens, Robin","Thijs, Vincent","Sudlow, Cathie","Wardlaw, Joanna","Rothwell, Peter M","Meschia, James F","Worrall, Bradford B","Levi, Christopher","Bevan, Steve","Furie, Karen L","Dichgans, Martin","Rosand, Jonathan","Markus, Hugh S","Rost, Natalia",", ","Matthew Traylor","Cathy R.
