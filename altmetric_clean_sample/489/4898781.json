The strains are thus considered as belonging to one and the same species which, according to the rules of priority retains the name Lactobacillus delbrueckii. On the basis of different habitats and different ranges of fermented sugars, the two subspecies, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis comb, nov., and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus comb. nov. are described.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f610006756","authors":["Weiss, N","Schillinger, U","Kandler, O"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0723-2020(83)80012-5","first_seen_on":"2015-12-19T18:39:03+00:00","issns":["0723-2020"],"issue":"4","journal":"Systematic & Applied Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1450550340,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23194812"],"pmid":"23194812","pubdate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus leichmannii and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Subjective Synonyms of Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Description of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis comb. nov. and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus comb. nov.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lactobacillus-lactis-lactobacillus-leichmannii-lactobacillus-bulgaricus-subjective-synonyms-lactobac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6792385,"mean":6.175626080326,"rank":1580593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4499279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6792385,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292733,"mean":8.7805872743669,"rank":82627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":206113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292733,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":401,"mean":2.608435,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":401,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.305,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
