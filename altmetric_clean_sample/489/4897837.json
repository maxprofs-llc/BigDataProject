Social-emotional outcome was similar to Australian norms in all domains but better than the American based norms in the Internalizing domain (P\u2009<\u2009.05). Higher maternal education was associated to better neurodevelopmental outcome in all domains and better scores in the internalizing and externalizing domains of the ITSEA. There was a moderate correlation (r\u2009=\u20090.43, P\u2009<\u2009.001) between Language and social-emotional competence. Motor development was influenced by the need for a significant cardiac reoperation.\nThe influences of social factors may be underestimated in the outcome of children with CHD. Language development in those with CHD may be improved with intervention targeting social-emotional competence; further research is needed in this area.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5223cf058f610003ada","authors":["Goldsworthy, Michelle","Franich-Ray, Candice","Kinney, Sharon","Shekerdemian, Lara","Beca, John","Gunn, Julia","Michelle Goldsworthy","Candice Franich-Ray","Sharon Kinney","Lara Shekerdemian","John Beca","Julia Gunn"],"doi":"10.1111\/chd.12320","endpage":"385","first_seen_on":"2015-12-19T11:47:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1747-0803","1747079X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Congenital Heart Disease","last_mentioned_on":1459394393,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26680016?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26680016?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26680016","pubdate":"2015-12-19T22:00:52+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"378","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Relationship between Social-Emotional and Neurodevelopment of 2-Year-Old Children with Congenital Heart Disease.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/chd.12320","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-socialemotional-neurodevelopment-2yearold-children-congenital-heart-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7471181,"mean":6.4836306053357,"rank":3404769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3898593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7471181,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301278,"mean":8.9727195504467,"rank":128302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":162146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301278,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262,"mean":1.1780536398467,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.74545454545455,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
