The preclinical work that led to these clinical trials used allografts of fetal VM tissue placed into 6-OHDA lesioned rats, while the patients received similar allografts under cover of immunosuppression in an \u03b1-synuclein disease state. Thus developing models that more faithfully replicate the clinical scenario would be a useful tool for the translation of such cell-based therapies to the clinic.\nHere, we show that while providing functional recovery, transplantation of fetal dopamine neurons into the AAV-\u03b1-synuclein rat model of PD resulted in smaller-sized grafts as compared to similar grafts placed into the 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum. Additionally, we found that cyclosporin treatment was able to promote the survival of the transplanted cells in this allografted state and surprisingly also provided therapeutic benefit in sham-operated animals. We demonstrated that delayed cyclosporin treatment afforded neurorestoration in three complementary models of PD including the Thy1-\u03b1-synuclein transgenic mouse, a novel AAV-\u03b1-synuclein mouse model, and the MPTP mouse model. We then explored the mechanisms for this benefit of cyclosporin and found it was mediated by both cell-autonomous mechanisms and non-cell autonomous mechanisms.\nThis study provides compelling evidence in favor for the use of immunosuppression in all grafted PD patients receiving cell replacement therapy, regardless of the immunological mismatch between donor and host cells, and also suggests that cyclosporine treatment itself may act as a disease-modifying therapy in all PD patients.","altmetric_jid":"52493b893cf058be6f8b4567","authors":["Tamburrino, Anna","Churchill, Madeline J","Wan, Oi W","Colino-Sanguino, Yolanda","Ippolito, Rossana","Bergstrand, Sofie","Wolf, Daniel A","Herz, Niculin J","Sconce, Michelle D","Bj\u00f6rklund, Anders","Meshul, Charles K","Decressac, Mickael"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40478-015-0263-6","first_seen_on":"2015-12-18T02:17:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2051-5960"],"issue":"1","journal":"Acta Neuropathologica Communications","last_mentioned_on":1464473768,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26666562?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26666562","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s40478-015-0263-6"],"pmcid":"PMC4678733","pmid":"26666562","pubdate":"2015-12-18T22:03:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Cyclosporin promotes neurorestoration and cell replacement therapy in pre-clinical models of Parkinson\u2019s disease","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cyclosporin-promotes-neurorestoration-cell-replacement-therapy-preclinical-models-parkinsons-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7822782,"mean":6.6331385505942,"rank":717950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7098023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7822782,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304160,"mean":8.9482796300617,"rank":37219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":266395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304160,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":363,"mean":7.1509005524862,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":363,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":8.218962962963,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
