This paper explores the feasibility of rapid detection of multiple biomarker proteins in model oral cancer samples using label-free protein relative quantitation.\nMass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative proteomics offer a rapid alternative that bypasses the need for stable isotope containing compounds to chemically bind and label proteins. Total protein content in oral cancer cell culture conditioned media was precipitated, subjected to proteolytic digestion and then analyzed using a nanoUPLC coupled to a hybrid Q-Tof \u00edon-mobility mass spectrometer (MS).\nRapid, simultaneous identification and quantification of multiple possible cancer biomarker proteins was achieved. In a comparative study between cancer and non-cancer samples, approximately 952 proteins were identified using a high-throughput 1D ion mobility-assisted data independent acquisition (IM-DIA) approach. As we previously demonstrated that Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) were readily detected in oral cancer cell conditioned media(1a) , we targeted these biomarker proteins to validate our approach. Target biomarker protein IL-8 was found between 3.5 fmol to 8.8 fmol, while VEGF-A was found at 1.45 fmol in the cancer cell media.\nOverall, our data suggests that the nanoUPLC-IM-DIA bioassay is a feasible approach to identify and quantify proteins in complex samples without the need for stable isotope labeling. These results have significant implications for rapid tumor diagnostics and prognostics by monitoring proteins such as IL-8 and VEGF-A implicated in cancer development and progression. The analysis in tissue or plasma are not possible at this time but the subsequent work would be needed for validation. This article is protected by copyright.
