Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease will become the number one cause of liver disease worldwide by 2020. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is correlated albeit imperfectly with obesity and other metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease, but exactly how having one of these diseases contributes to the development of other metabolic diseases is only now being elucidated. Development of NAFLD and related metabolic diseases is genetically influenced in the population, and recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered genetic variants that associate with these diseases. These GWAS-associated variants cannot only help us to identify individuals at high risk of developing NAFLD, but also to better understand its pathophysiology so that we can develop more effective treatments for this disease and related metabolic diseases in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f61000350e","authors":["Kahali, Bratati","Halligan, Brian","Speliotes, Elizabeth K"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0035-1567870","endpage":"391","first_seen_on":"2015-12-18T11:03:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-8971","0272-8087"],"issue":"4","journal":"Seminars in Liver Disease","last_mentioned_on":1474366072,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26676813?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26676813?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26676813","pubdate":"2015-12-18T22:00:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"375","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Insights from Genome-Wide Association Analyses of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insights-genomewide-association-analyses-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":1927011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6480724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311942,"mean":9.0825468469997,"rank":79664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":232215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311942,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":3.003724137931,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.8333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
