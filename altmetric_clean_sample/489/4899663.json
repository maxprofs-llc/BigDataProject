Although the oncogenic effects of TPD52 are well recognized, how its expression and the role in migration\/invasion is still not clear. This study tried to explore the regulative role of microRNA-34a (miR-34a), a tumor suppressive miRNA, on TPD52 expression in breast cancer. The expression of miR-34a was found significantly decreased in breast cancer specimens with lymph node metastases and breast cancer cell lines. The clinicopathological characteristics analyzed showed that lower expression levels of miR-34a were associated with advanced clinical stages. Moreover, TPD52 was demonstrated as one of miR-34a direct targets in human breast cancer cells. miR-34a was further found significantly repress epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inhibit breast cancer cell migration and invasion via TPD52. These findings indicate that miR-34a inhibits breast cancer progression and metastasis through targeting TPD52. Consequently, our data strongly suggested that oncogenic TPD52 pathway regulated by miR-34a might be useful to reveal new therapeutic targets for breast cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Li, Guodong","Yao, Lei","Zhang, Jinning","Li, Xinglong","Dang, Shuwei","Zeng, Kai","Zhou, Yuhui","Gao, Feng","Guodong Li","Lei Yao","Jinning Zhang","Xinglong Li","Shuwei Dang","Kai Zeng","Yuhui Zhou","Feng Gao"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13277-015-4623-4","first_seen_on":"2015-12-20T03:52:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1423-0380","1010-4283"],"journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1450583552,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26678891?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s13277-015-4623-4"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs13277-015-4623-4.pdf","pmid":"26678891","pubdate":"2015-12-20T22:02:21+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Tumor-suppressive microRNA-34a inhibits breast cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting oncogenic TPD52.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumorsuppressive-microrna34a-inhibits-breast-cancer-cell-migration-invasion-via-targeting-oncogenic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6797067,"mean":6.1791144149531,"rank":5813034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6797067,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293349,"mean":8.7942995691123,"rank":237655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293349,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1688,"mean":1.0422987551867,"rank":885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1688,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281,"mean":0.62678571428571,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
