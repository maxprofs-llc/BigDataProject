We found that c-Cbl Cbl-b double knock-out (dKO) T cells became hyperresponsive upon anti-CD3 stimulation, even though the major T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling pathways were not enhanced. The dKO T cells did not down-modulate surface TCR after ligand engagement, which resulted in sustained TCR signaling. However, these cells showed normal ligand-independent TCR internalization, and trafficking of internalized TCR to the lysosome compartment after ligand engagement was reduced. These findings show that Cbl family proteins negatively regulate T cell activation by promoting clearance of engaged TCR from the cell surface, a process that is apparently essential for the termination of TCR signals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","authors":["Naramura, Mayumi","Jang, Ihn-Kyung","Kole, Hemanta","Huang, Fang","Haines, Diana","Gu, Hua"],"doi":"10.1038\/ni855","first_seen_on":"2015-12-17T17:51:25+00:00","issns":["1529-2908"],"issue":"12","journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1450374675,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12415267"],"pmid":"12415267","pubdate":"2002-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"c-Cbl and Cbl-b regulate T cell responsiveness by promoting ligand-induced TCR down-modulation.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ccbl-cblb-regulate-t-cell-responsiveness-promoting-ligandinduced-tcr-downmodulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6787729,"mean":6.1724472011828,"rank":1579256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4496592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6787729,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274115,"mean":8.7776952946584,"rank":76755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":193597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274115,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1956,"mean":9.0377063938619,"rank":746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1956,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":21.352113207547,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
