Baker's yeast, however, impacts dough matrix properties during fermentation, probably through the production of primary (CO2 and ethanol) and secondary (glycerol, acetic acid and succinic acid) metabolites. The aim of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the changes in yeasted dough behavior, introduced by fermentation, by investigating the impact of yeast fermentation on Farinograph dough consistency, dough spread, Kieffer Rig dough extensibility and gluten agglomeration behavior in a fermented dough-batter gluten starch separation system.\nResults show that fermentation leads to a dough with less flow and lower extensibility that breaks more easily under stress and strain. The dough showed less elastic and more plastic deformation behavior. Gluten agglomerates were smaller for yeasted dough than for the unyeasted control.\nThese changes probably have to be attributed to metabolites generated during fermentation. Indeed, organic acids and also ethanol in concentrations produced by yeast were previously shown to have similar effects in yeastless dough. These findings imply the high importance of yeast fermentation metabolites on dough matrix properties in industrial bread production.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ee9","authors":["Rezaei, Mohammad N","Jayaram, Vinay B","Verstrepen, Kevin J","Courtin, Christophe M","Mohammad N Rezaei","Vinay B Jayaram","Kevin J Verstrepen","Christophe M Courtin"],"doi":"10.1002\/jsfa.7562","first_seen_on":"2015-12-18T11:32:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1097-0010","00225142"],"journal":"Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture","last_mentioned_on":1494547569,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26676687?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26676687?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26676687","pubdate":"2015-12-18T22:00:22+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"The impact of yeast fermentation on dough matrix properties.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-yeast-fermentation-dough-matrix-properties"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8192854,"mean":6.9262032168704,"rank":5928753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1972839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8192854,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308661,"mean":9.0860066934489,"rank":193115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":96925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308661,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1437,"mean":3.0903342618384,"rank":807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1437,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":2.83871875,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
