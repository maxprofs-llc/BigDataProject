Cutaneous involvement occurs in approximately 10% of cases, and 3% of cases are limited to the skin without nodal or other extranodal involvement. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a clonal histiocytosis with a wide spectrum of presentations ranging from isolated skin or bone disease to multisystem involvement. Rare case reports have identified concomitant presentation of RDD and LCH; however, most of these reports have involved LCH and RDD occurring concurrently but at separate sites. We present a rare case of concurrent RDD and LCH presenting within a single skin nodule. The patient did not have any evidence of systemic involvement and has remained stable without additional treatment. We also review the literature on this unusual co-presentation and suggest possible underlying mechanisms. Finally, we recommend baseline laboratory and imaging studies and discuss treatment options based on the available evidence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6083cf058f610006970","authors":["Litzner, Brandon R","Subtil, Antonio","Vidal, Claudia I"],"doi":"10.1097\/dad.0000000000000347","first_seen_on":"2015-12-18T23:55:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-0311","0193-1091"],"issue":"12","journal":"The American Journal of Dermatopathology","last_mentioned_on":1452802607,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/amjdermatopathology\/Abstract\/2015\/12000\/Combined_Cutaneous_Rosai_Dorfman_Disease_and.13.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjdermatopathology\/2015\/12000\/Combined_Cutaneous_Rosai_Dorfman_Disease_and.13.pdf","pmid":"26588339","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"936","subjects":["pathology","dermatology"],"title":"Combined Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman Disease and Localized Cutaneous Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis Within a Single Subcutaneous Nodule","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combined-cutaneous-rosaidorfman-disease-localized-cutaneous-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-within-sin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6975036,"mean":6.2337487846271,"rank":5211568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":989872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6975036,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293866,"mean":8.7999919691013,"rank":200504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":54037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293866,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":617,"mean":1.4395844155844,"rank":393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":617,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.94047619047619,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jamilarxh14\/statuses\/687730099672756225","license":"gnip","rt":["orlmedicine"],"citation_ids":[4896120],"posted_on":"2016-01-14T20:16:47+00:00","author":{"name":"jamila abee","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/677789857918267392\/eRIpFEr8_normal.jpg","description":"When a wall blocks your path, knock it down and build steps.","id_on_source":"jamilarxh14","tweeter_id":"3668474602","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":1182},"tweet_id":"687730099672756225"}]}}
