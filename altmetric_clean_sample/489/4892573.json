Intra-class correlation (ICC) and corresponding variance components were estimated from these studies. Raters were asked to comment on their experience with the framework.\nWhile overall the mean inter-rater reliability showed no significant rater-effect (ICC= 0.69, p= 0.064), there was - presumably as a result of a lower study variability - a significant rater effect for clopidogrel only (p < 0.001). The framework allowed a more structured methodological assessment but several items remained unclear.\nRegarding the quality assessment of modelling studies with the proposed framework, the rater variability is similar or even higher than variability due to studies or residual effects. Several scoring items can and should be improved to ease interpretation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d8","authors":["Dirk M\u00fcller"],"doi":"10.1586\/14737167.2016.1115721","first_seen_on":"2015-12-18T08:07:03+00:00","issns":["1744-8379"],"journal":"Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research","last_mentioned_on":1451633723,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/14737167.2016.1115721?ai=1plef&mi=ianpxd&af=R","http:\/\/tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/14737167.2016.1115721?ai=1plef&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"26548753","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Reporting health care decision models: a prospective reliability study of a multidimensional evaluation framework","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reporting-health-care-decision-models-prospective-reliability-study-multidimensional-evaluation-fram"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6897266,"mean":6.1917907788066,"rank":4895656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1754892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6897266,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292579,"mean":8.7734941861656,"rank":181065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":93614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292579,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":419,"mean":1.7692966507177,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":419,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.0186315789474,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CEStezhka\/statuses\/677761911786704896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4892573],"posted_on":"2015-12-18T08:06:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Tanya - ERP&OR","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/ierp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585788897323520000\/MwmgjKlF_normal.png","description":"Managing Editor, Expert Reviews, Journal of Medical Economics.
