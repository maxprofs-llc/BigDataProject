We aimed to explore differences between two groups of Orthodox Jewish male volunteers: the \"ZAKA\" body handlers (ZAs: n = 102), and a comparison group of charity workers (CWs: n = 101). Furthermore, we assessed the contribution of two potential resilience buffers-sense of coherence (SOC) and spirituality at the workplace (SAW)-to PTSS, BO, and CS among these volunteers via self-report measures. Surprisingly, results show that ZAs reported significantly lower levels of PTSS and BO as compared with CWs. ZAs also reported significantly higher levels of CS as compared with CWs. Importantly, SOC mediated the link between groups and PTSS and BO. Both SOC and SAW mediated the link between groups and CS. These findings suggest that \"ZAKA\" body handlers demonstrate substantial resilience following repeated exposure to death and atrocities. To reduce work-related psychological distress and improve CS, SOC and SAW should be taken into account in the process of recruitment and training of body handlers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f5","authors":["Gadi Zerach","Yafit Levin"],"doi":"10.1177\/0886260515621065","first_seen_on":"2015-12-19T04:10:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-6518"],"journal":"Journal of Interpersonal Violence","last_mentioned_on":1450691835,"links":["http:\/\/jiv.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/17\/0886260515621065.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26685213?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jiv.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/12\/17\/0886260515621065.full.pdf","pmid":"26685213","pubdate":"2015-12-20T13:06:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Criminology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms, Burn-Out, and Compassion Satisfaction Among Body Handlers: The Mediating Role of Sense of Coherence and Spirituality at Workplace.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/posttraumatic-stress-symptoms-burnout-compassion-satisfaction-among-body-handlers-mediating-role-sen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6803403,"mean":6.1842532809271,"rank":2776969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3958179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6803403,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293080,"mean":8.7812954391132,"rank":115111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":172916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293080,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1405,"mean":4.7077293447293,"rank":649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1405,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":1.4285714285714,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
