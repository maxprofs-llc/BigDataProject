However, recent studies have shown that other Saccharomyces species can also be involved in wine fermentation or are useful for wine bouquet, such as Saccharomyces uvarum and Saccharomyces paradoxus. Many interspecies hybrids have also been isolated from wine fermentation, such as S.\u00a0cerevisiae\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Saccharomyces kudriavzevii hybrids. In this study, we explored the genetic diversity and fermentation performance of Spanish S.\u00a0kudriavzevii strains, which we compared to other S.\u00a0kudriavzevii strains. Fermentations of red and white grape musts were performed, and the phenotypic differences between Spanish S.\u00a0kudriavzevii strains under different temperature conditions were examined. An ANOVA analysis suggested striking similarity between strains for glycerol and ethanol production, although a high diversity of aromatic profiles among fermentations was found. The sources of these phenotypic differences are not well understood and require further investigation. Although the Spanish S.\u00a0kudriavzevii strains showed desirable properties, particularly must fermentations, the quality of their wines was no better than those produced with a commercial S.\u00a0cerevisiae. We suggest hybridization or directed evolution as methods to improve and innovate wine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f8","authors":["Peris, D","P\u00e9rez-Trav\u00e9s, L","Belloch, C","Querol, A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fm.2015.07.010","first_seen_on":"2015-12-19T19:09:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-9998"],"issue":"Pt B","journal":"Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1450567026,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26678127?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26678127","pubdate":"2015-12-19T22:01:30+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Enological characterization of Spanish Saccharomyces kudriavzevii strains, one of the closest relatives to parental strains of winemaking and brewing Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0S.\u00a0kudriavzevii hybrids.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enological-characterization-spanish-saccharomyces-kudriavzevii-strains-one-closest-relatives-parenta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6792385,"mean":6.175626080326,"rank":5045359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":983501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6792385,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292732,"mean":8.7806061674369,"rank":198620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":55577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292732,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":567,"mean":3.4176572438163,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":567,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.0521739130435,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
