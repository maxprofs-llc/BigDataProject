In a mixed-longitudinal study done in Merida, Yucatan, height, body mass index (BMI), and percentage of body fat (BF%) were recorded at a one-year interval among 258 postmenarcheal (EM\u00a0=\u00a094) girls. Anthropometric measurements were recorded of the age cohorts in 2008-09 when participants were 13-17\u00a0years of age (baseline), and in the one-year follow-up study (\u00b1 6\u00a0days) the girls were 14-18\u00a0years of age. The BF% was estimated through bioelectrical impedance analysis. Mean AAM was 10.59\u00a0years in EM girls and 12.54\u00a0years in not early menarche (NEM) girls. Height growth (cm\/year) was greater in NEM girls. Mean values of BMI, BF%, and frequencies of stunting (low height-for-age) and excess weight (overweight + obesity) were higher in EM girls than in their NEM age peers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f610001692","authors":["Sudip Datta-Banik","Nina Mendez","Federico Dickinson"],"doi":"10.1080\/03670244.2015.1072814","first_seen_on":"2015-12-20T07:35:46+00:00","issns":["1543-5237"],"issue":"6","journal":"Ecology of Food and Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1453462017,"links":["https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/283351711_Height_Growth_and_Percentage_of_Body_Fat_in_Relation_to_Early_Menarche_in_Girls_from_Merida_Yucatan_Mexico"],"pmid":"26517307","pubdate":"2015-10-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Height Growth and Percentage of Body Fat in Relation to Early Menarche in Girls from Merida, Yucatan, Mexico","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/height-growth-percentage-body-fat-relation-early-menarche-girls-merida-yucatan-mexico"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7007649,"mean":6.258769735863,"rank":6017057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7007649,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296532,"mean":8.8602851169016,"rank":243150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296532,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":4.45492,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.75,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
