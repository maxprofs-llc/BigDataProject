The Patient-owned Survivorship Transition Care for Activated, Empowered survivors (POSTCARE) is a single coaching encounter based on the Chronic Care Model that uses motivational interviewing techniques to engage survivors of breast cancer. The current study examined the effects of the POSTCARE intervention on patient outcomes and care coordination.\nA total of 79 survivors of American Joint Commision on Cancer TNM System stage 0 to IIIB breast cancer were randomized to POSTCARE (40 patients) or usual care (39 patients). Patient outcomes were assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Social\/Role Activities Limitations, Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-Item Scale, the Patient Activation Measure-Short Form, and Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale at baseline and at 3-month follow-up. Care coordination was assessed using confirmed primary care physician visits and reported discussion of the survivorship care plan at the 3-month follow-up. Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of POSTCARE on selected outcomes.\nParticipants in the intervention group versus those receiving usual care demonstrated significantly higher self-reported health (F-statistic (3,71), 3.63; P =.017) and lower social role limitations (F (3,70), 3.82; P =.014) and a trend toward greater self-efficacy (F (3,69), 2.51; P = .07). Three quality-of-life domains reached clinically meaningful improvement at the 3-month follow-up, including physical role (P =.0009), bodily pain (P =.03), and emotional role (P =.04).\nThe POSTCARE intervention appeared to have a positive impact on patient outcomes and demonstrated promise as a strategy with which to improve survivors' experience, care coordination, and health outcomes.
