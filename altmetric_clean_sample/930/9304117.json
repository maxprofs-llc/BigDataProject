Lack of RFR may be a risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI), but is cumbersome to measure. We sought to develop a non-invasive, bedside method that would indirectly measure RFR. Mechanical abdominal pressure, through compression of renal vessels, decreases blood flow and activates the auto-regulatory mechanism which can be measured by a fall in renal resistive index (RRI). The study aims at elucidating the relationship between intra-parenchymal renal resistive index variation (IRRIV) during abdominal pressure and RFR. In healthy volunteers, pressure was applied by a weight on the abdomen (fluid-bag 10% of subject's body weight) while RFR was measured through a protein loading test. We recorded RRI in an interlobular artery after application of pressure using ultrasound. The maximum percentage reduction of RRI from baseline was compared in the same subject to RFR. We enrolled 14 male and 16 female subjects (mean age 38 \u00b1 14 years). Mean creatinine clearance was 106.2 \u00b1 16.4 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2). RFR ranged between -1.9 and 59.7 with a mean value of 28.9 \u00b1 13.1 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2). Mean baseline RRI was 0.61 \u00b1 0.05, compared to 0.49 \u00b1 0.06 during abdominal pressure; IRRIV was 19.6 \u00b1 6.7%, ranging between 3.1% and 29.2%. Pearson's coefficient between RFR and IRRIV was 74.16% (p < 0.001). Our data show the correlation between IRRIV and RFR. Our results can lead to the development of a \"stress test\" for a rapid screen of RFR to establish renal susceptibility to different exposures and the consequent risk for AKI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc19","authors":["Samoni, Sara","Nalesso, Federico","Meola, Mario","Villa, Gianluca","De Cal, Massimo","De Rosa, Silvia","Petrucci, Ilaria","Brendolan, Alessandra","Rosner, Mitchell H.","Ronco, Claudio","Rosner, Mitchell H"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphys.2016.00286","first_seen_on":"2016-07-08T07:16:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-042X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1470044025,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphys.2016.00286\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27458386"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphys.2016.00286\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4933701","pmid":"27458386","pubdate":"2016-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Intra-Parenchymal Renal Resistive Index Variation (IRRIV) Describes Renal Functional Reserve (RFR): Pilot Study in Healthy Volunteers","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intraparenchymal-renal-resistive-index-variation-irriv-describes-renal-functional-reserve-rfr-pilot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":6189763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1095986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260248,"mean":11.626560598201,"rank":181969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260248,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2832,"mean":5.7424139879901,"rank":1567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2832,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":9.4412413793103,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontPhysiol\/statuses\/751094713994735616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9304117],"posted_on":"2016-07-07T16:45:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Physiol","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Physiology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533286083207766016\/8U7NEYhH_normal.jpeg","description":"Frontiers in Physiology is the largest open-access journal in the field of Physiology.","id_on_source":"FrontPhysiol","tweeter_id":"397339470","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":2030},"tweet_id":"751094713994735616"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=531413930384120&id=305046899687492","license":"public","citation_ids":[9304117],"posted_on":"2016-08-01T09:33:45+00:00","summary":"IRRIV PUBLICATION:\n\nIntra-Parenchymal Renal Resistive Index Variation (IRRIV) Describes Renal Functional Reserve (RFR): Pilot Study in Healthy Volunteers.\n\nSamoni S, Nalesso F, Meola M, Villa G, De Cal M, De Rosa S, Petrucci I, Brendolan A, Rosner MH, Ronc","author":{"name":"IRRIV-International Renal Research Institute Vicenza","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/305046899687492","facebook_wall_name":"IRRIV-International Renal Research Institute Vicenza","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/305046899687492\/picture","id_on_source":"305046899687492"}}]}}
