We evaluated the operative and postoperative conditions and long-term follow-up of these patients.\nThe success rate and the complete resection rate were both 100%. The maximum diameter of the tumor ranged from 1.0 to 3.5 cm (2.2\u00b10.2 cm). The operation time was 20 to 120 min (50\u00b15 min). During ESE, bleeding occurred in all cases (100%) with a mean blood loss of 50 mL, and perforation in 6 (20%), including 2 full-thickness resections. GIST was confirmed by pathology in all cases. Follow-up included endoscopy at 1, 3, and 6 months, and at 1 year. At 1 month, ulcer was detected in 23 cases (76.67%), titanium clips remained in 17 cases (56.67%), and scar tissues were observed in the remainder. No recurrence was found with gastroscopy.\nThe cardia is a unique anatomic location for GISTs, which often requires complex surgeries prone to complications. ESE for GISTs of the cardia is a challenging, but safe and effective procedure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005d00","authors":["Shanshan Wang","Lei Shen"],"doi":"10.1097\/sle.0000000000000330","first_seen_on":"2017-04-19T10:17:51+00:00","issns":["1530-4515"],"journal":"Surgical Laparoscopy, Endoscopy & Percutaneous Techniques","last_mentioned_on":1492596997,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27846180?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27846180","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Efficacy of Endoscopic Submucosal Excavation for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors in the Cardia","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":6997541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232954,"mean":12.773747451202,"rank":189702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232954,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":446,"mean":1.1805258426966,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":446,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.3066666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/854639865379434496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19156865],"posted_on":"2017-04-19T10:16:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"854639865379434496"}]}}
