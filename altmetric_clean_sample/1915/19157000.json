To investigate whether prior treatment of atorvastatin reduces the frequency of hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). Methods. Totally, 492 patients with acute ischemic stroke and Glasgow Coma Scale \u2264 8 were enrolled in this study. Subjects were assigned to prior atorvastatin treatment group (n = 268, PG) and no prior treatment group (n = 224, NG). All the patients were given 20\u2009mg atorvastatin every night during their hospital stay. HAP frequency and 28-day mortality were measured. Levels of inflammatory biomarkers [white blood cell (WBC), procalcitonin (PCT), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] were tested. Results. There was no significant difference in the incidence of HAP between PG and NG (25.74% versus. 24.55%, p > 0.05) and 28-day mortality (50.72% versus 58.18%, p > 0.05). However, prior statin treatment did modify the mortality of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (36.54% versus 58.14%, p = 0.041) and proved to be a protective factor (HR, 0.564; 95% CI, 0.310~0.825, p = 0.038). Concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in PG VAP cases were lower than those in NG VAP cases (p < 0.01). Conclusions. Prior atorvastatin treatment in patients with ischemic stroke was associated with a lower concentration of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 and improved the outcome of VAP. This clinical study has been registered with ChiCTR-ROC-17010633 in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Yuetian Yu","Cheng Zhu","Chunyan Liu","Yuan Gao"],"doi":"10.1155\/2017\/5642704","first_seen_on":"2017-04-19T10:20:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6133","2314-6141"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1492597219,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28357403?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5357518","pmid":"28357403","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Effect of Prior Atorvastatin Treatment on the Frequency of Hospital Acquired Pneumonia and Evolution of Biomarkers in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Multicenter Prospective Study","type":"article","volume":"2017","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-prior-atorvastatin-treatment-frequency-hospital-acquired-pneumonia-evolution-biomarkers-patie"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":6997542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232954,"mean":12.773750241465,"rank":189702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232954,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4295,"mean":3.0048188169539,"rank":3075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4295,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":2.3586216216216,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Neuroscience":1,"Chemistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LungOmics\/statuses\/854640798687608832","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19157000],"posted_on":"2017-04-19T10:20:19+00:00","author":{"name":"LungOmics","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"An automated account posting papers directly from pubmed, based on searches related to the 'omics of respiratory disease.","id_on_source":"LungOmics","tweeter_id":"781005050919391232","geo":{"lt":43.00035,"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US"},"followers":11},"tweet_id":"854640798687608832"}]}}
