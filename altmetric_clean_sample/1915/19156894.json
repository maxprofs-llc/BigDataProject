Coefficients of repeatability (CR) were calculated.\nMean (range) age was 57 (21-88) years. Mean central subfield thickness (CST) and total macular volume were 264 and 258\u00a0\u03bcm (P\u00a0=\u00a00.62), and 8.0 and 7.8\u00a0mm(3) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.31), before and after manual correction. Intersession CR (95% confidence interval) for CST and total macular volume were reduced from 40 (38-41) to 8.3 (8.1-8.5) and 0.62 to 0.16\u00a0mm(3) after manual correction of segmentation lines. CR for CST were 7.4, 23.5 and 66.7\u00a0\u03bcm before and 7.0, 10.9 and 7.6\u00a0\u03bcm after manual correction in groups i, ii and iii.\nSegmentation error in eyes with RPE disease has a significant impact on intersession repeatability of Spectralis spectral-domain optical coherence tomography macular thickness and volume metrics. Careful examination of each B-scan and manual adjustment can enhance the utility of quantitative measurement. Improved automated segmentation algorithms are needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000254b","authors":["Daren Hanumunthadu","Jin Ping Wang","Wei Chen","Evan N Wong","Yi Chen","William H Morgan","Praveen J Patel","Fred K Chen"],"doi":"10.1111\/ceo.12868","first_seen_on":"2017-04-19T10:18:24+00:00","issns":["14426404"],"journal":"Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1492597087,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28052542?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28052542","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Impact of retinal pigment epithelium pathology on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography-derived macular thickness and volume metrics and their intersession repeatability","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-retinal-pigment-epithelium-pathology-spectraldomain-optical-coherence-tomographyderived-macul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":4271921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2245779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232953,"mean":12.773800139084,"rank":129959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":81818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232953,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":521,"mean":2.9532923076923,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":521,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":12.706,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/854640246926876674","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19156894],"posted_on":"2017-04-19T10:18:07+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
