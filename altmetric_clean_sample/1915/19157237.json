Conversion to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) is a potential solution. The aim of this study was to determine the common indications for conversion from SG to RYGB at our centre, and evaluate patient outcomes with respect to weight loss and co-morbidity resolution.\nA retrospective review of patients who underwent conversion from SG to RYGB between 2008 and 2015.\n273 SGs were performed of which 6.6% (n\u00a0=\u00a018) were converted to RYGB most commonly due to inadequate weight loss (65.3%) and severe reflux (26.1%). Two patients were converted as a planned two-stage approach to RYGB. Patients went from a mean preoperative BMI of 50.5 to a mean BMI of 40.5 post-SG on average by 20.9 months. The mean time to conversion was 41.8 months. There was a positive correlation between pre-SG BMI and time to conversion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.040). The mean BMI after conversion was 36.4, but this additional weight loss was not significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.057). After conversion, four of the five diabetic patients are now medication free and 75% of patients no longer have reflux symptoms. All patients had complete resolution of their hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea. Revision perioperative complication rates were comparable to primary RYGB. Two patients developed new onset iron deficiency anemia.\nRevision to RYGB is a safe option for SG failure and resulted in significant benefits from co-morbidity resolution.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","authors":["Ekua Yorke","Caroline Sheppard","Noah J.
