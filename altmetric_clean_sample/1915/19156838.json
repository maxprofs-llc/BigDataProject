The role of autophagy was originally shown to be a mechanism of energy production under starvation. In fact, multiple lines of evidence reveal that autophagy has numerous functions, such as protection from stress, energy regulation, immune regulation, differentiation, proliferation, and cell death. In the field of reproduction, the role of autophagy in implantation, embryogenesis, placentation, and delivery has become clearer. In addition, recent study has elucidated that the placenta has the ability to protect extraplacental cells from virus infection by activating autophagy. During resent research into autophagy, several issues have occurred in the interpretation of the autophagy status. In this review, we discuss the relation between autophagy and reproductive events, and show the importance of autophagy for placentation and pre-eclampsia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e90","authors":["Nakashima, Akitoshi","Aoki, Aiko","Kusabiraki, Tae","Shima, Tomoko","Yoshino, Osamu","Cheng, Shi-Bin","Sharma, Surendra","Saito, Shigeru"],"doi":"10.1111\/jog.13292","first_seen_on":"2017-04-19T10:17:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1341-8076","1447-0756"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology Research","last_mentioned_on":1502186826,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28418212?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28418212","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Role of autophagy in oocytogenesis, embryogenesis, implantation, and pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-autophagy-oocytogenesis-embryogenesis-implantation-pathophysiology-preeclampsia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":4447123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2322071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246178,"mean":12.830391840017,"rank":137082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":86636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246178,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":642,"mean":2.9306521060843,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":642,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.80833333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
