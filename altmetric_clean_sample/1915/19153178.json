Our study aimed to investigate the association between liver function and MS in a large cohort of Chinese men and women. We enrolled 32,768 ostensibly healthy participants. The associations between liver function and MS of both genders were analyzed separately after dividing total bilirubin (TBIL), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) into quartiles. Young males had significantly higher MS prevalence than females, yet after menopause, females had higher MS prevalence. We used TBIL, GGT and ALT quartiles as categorical variables in binary logistic regression models. Significantly decreased MS risks were demonstrated in TBIL quartiles 2 to 4 for males, and quartiles 3 to 4 for females. As to GGT and ALT, significantly increased MS risks were shown in high quartiles for both genders. Aging also resulted in significantly higher MS risks in both genders except for young females. This study displayed close associations between liver function and MS, which were influenced by gender and age. A high TBIL level had protective effect against MS, while high GGT and ALT levels were risk factors for MS. It is meaningful that liver function is used as clinical risk predictors for MS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Sen Wang","Jie Zhang","Li Zhu","Linlin Song","Zhaowei Meng","Qiang Jia","Xue Li","Na Liu","Tianpeng Hu","Pingping Zhou","Qing Zhang","Li Liu","Kun Song","Qiyu Jia"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep44844","first_seen_on":"2017-04-19T06:39:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1500372861,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/srep44844","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5357848\/"],"pmid":"28317840","pubdate":"2017-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Metabolic syndrome","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Risk factors","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Association between liver function and metabolic syndrome in Chinese men and women","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-liver-function-metabolic-syndrome-chinese-men-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229472,"mean":6.9710874477773,"rank":7121611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229472,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239557,"mean":12.874006687371,"rank":195897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239557,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35042,"mean":14.821363773865,"rank":29400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35042,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3344,"mean":18.860318276997,"rank":2675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3344,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AlexViKu\/statuses\/887254205026766848","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19153178],"posted_on":"2017-07-18T10:14:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Alex","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/888168375385546752\/XnyIwtKG_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"AlexViKu","tweeter_id":"4794588673","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":29},"tweet_id":"887254205026766848"}]}}
