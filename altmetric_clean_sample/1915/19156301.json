The small molecule inhibitor volasertib induces a mitotic block via inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 and has shown remarkable anti-leukemic activity when combined with low-dose cytarabine. We have demonstrated that AML cells are highly vulnerable to cell death in mitosis yet manage to escape a mitotic block through mitotic slippage by sustained proteasome-dependent slow degradation of cyclin B. Therefore, we tested whether interfering with mitotic slippage through proteasome inhibition arrests and kills AML cells more efficiently during mitosis. We show that therapeutic doses of bortezomib block the slow degradation of cyclin B during a volasertib-induced mitotic arrest in AML cell lines and patient-derived primary AML cells. In a xenotransplant mouse model of human AML, mice receiving volasertib in combination with bortezomib showed superior disease control compared to mice receiving volasertib alone, highlighting the potential therapeutic impact of this drug combination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Dominik Schnerch","Julia Sch\u00fcler","Marie Follo","Julia Felthaus","Dagmar Wider","Kathrin Klingner","Christine Greil","Justus Duyster","Monika Engelhardt","Ralph W\u00e4sch"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.15503","first_seen_on":"2017-04-19T10:04:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1492596381,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28416751?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28416751","pubdate":"2017-04-19T22:08:36+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Proteasome inhibition enhances the efficacy of volasertib-induced mitotic arrest in AML <i>in vitro<\/i> and prolongs survival <i>in vivo<\/i>","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteasome-inhibition-enhances-efficacy-volasertibinduced-mitotic-arrest-aml-vitro-prolongs-survival"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":4038534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3839697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232953,"mean":12.773801212267,"rank":118294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":104559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232953,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8491,"mean":3.1007123674912,"rank":2185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":5809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8491,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1201,"mean":2.3443733333333,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1201,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
