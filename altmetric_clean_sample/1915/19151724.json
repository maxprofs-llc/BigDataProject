Recently, these two methods showed discrepancies with an increasing number of PCR undetectable RSV-B viruses.\nEstablish if mismatches in the primer and probe binding sites could have reduced real-time RT-PCR sensitivity.\nNucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) genes were sequenced for real-time RT-PCR positive and negative samples. Primer and probe binding regions in N gene were checked for mismatches and phylogenetic analyses done to determine molecular epidemiology of these viruses. New primers and probe were designed and tested on the previously real-time RT-PCR negative samples.\nN gene sequences revealed 3 different mismatches in the probe target site of PCR negative, IFAT positive viruses. The primers target sites had no mismatches. Phylogenetic analysis of N and G genes showed that real-time RT-PCR positive and negative samples fell into distinct clades. Newly designed primers-probe pair improved detection and recovered previous PCR undetectable viruses.\nAn emerging RSV-B variant is undetectable by a quite widely used real-time RT-PCR assay due to polymorphisms that influence probe hybridization affecting PCR accuracy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d09","authors":["Everlyn Kamau","Charles N.
