Comparisons were made using chi square tests for categorical data and t tests for continuous data between US-born and foreign-born students.\nOf 120 participants (55\u00a0% women) with racial diversity (49 whites, 18 blacks, 26 Hispanics, 14 Asians, and 13 other), 49 (41\u00a0%) were foreign-born. Comparisons between US-born and foreign-born students showed no differences in average age or gender though US-born had more whites. There were no differences between US-born and foreign-born students for grade point averages, weekday bedtimes, wake times, or total sleep times. However, US-born students averaged 50\u00a0min less study time per day (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), had almost 9\u00a0h less paid employment per week (14.5 vs 23.4\u00a0h per week, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and stayed up to socialize more frequently (63 vs 43\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Foreign-born students awakened an hour earlier and averaged 40\u00a0min less sleep per night on weekends.\nCultural differences among college students have a profound effect on sleep habits, study hours, and extracurricular time. The design of a sleep improvement program targeting a population with diverse cultural backgrounds must factor in such behavioral variations in order to have relevance and impact.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000894b","authors":["Arne H.
