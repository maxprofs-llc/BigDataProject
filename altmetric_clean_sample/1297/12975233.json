In this subgroup analysis of RAMSES study, patients who were on NOACs were classified as appropriately treated (AT), undertreated (UT), and overtreated (OT) according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. The independent predictors of UT and OT were determined by multivariate logistic regression.Of the 2086 eligible patients, 1247 (59.8%) received adequate treatment. However, off-label use was detected in 839 (40.2%) patients; 634 (30.4%) patients received UT and 205 (9.8%) received OT. Independent predictors of UT included >65 years of age, creatinine clearance \u226550\u200amL\/min, urban living, existing dabigatran treatment, and HAS-BLED score of <3, whereas that of OT were creatinine clearance <50\u200amL\/min, ongoing rivaroxaban treatment, and HAS-BLED score of \u22653.The suboptimal use of NOACs is common because of physicians' poor compliance to the guideline recommendations in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Older patients who were on dabigatran treatment with good renal functions and low risk of bleeding were at risk of UT, whereas patients who were on rivaroxaban treatment with renal impairment and high risk of bleeding were at risk of OT. Therefore, a greater emphasis should be given to prescribe the recommended dose for the specified patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["\u00d6zcan Ba\u015faran","Volkan Dogan","Osman Beton","Mehmet Tekinalp","Ahmet Ca\u011fri Aykan","Ezgi Kalaycio\u011flu","Ismail Bolat","Onur Ta\u015far","\u00d6zgen \u015eafak","Macit Kalcik","Mehmet Yaman","Sinan \u0130nci","Bernas Altinta\u015f","Sedat Kalkan","Cevat Kirma","Murat Biteker","and Collaborators"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000004672","first_seen_on":"2016-10-25T01:41:00+00:00","issns":["1536-5964","0025-7974"],"issue":"35","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1477359645,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5008576\/"],"pmid":"27583892","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wolters Kluwer Health","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e4672","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Suboptimal use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suboptimal-nonvitamin-k-antagonist-oral-anticoagulants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":5745112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1018784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235117,"mean":12.669164582589,"rank":163132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235117,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3701,"mean":2.9344567567568,"rank":2333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3701,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":9.6758461538462,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TomSilver39\/statuses\/790729780714876928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12975233],"posted_on":"2016-10-25T01:40:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom Silver","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3483240655\/dbab1242a5e60beadc49929ccfdc47a8_normal.jpeg","description":"Seek to uncover high-potential investment opportunities.
