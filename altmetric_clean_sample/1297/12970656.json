The silica NBs, which have a \"flask bottle\" shape with an average diameter of 350\u2005nm and an opening of ca. 100\u2005nm, are prepared by anisotropic sol-gel growth in a water\/n-pentanol emulsion. Due to their chemically asymmetric properties, nanoparticles (NPs) with hydrophilic or hydrophobic surface properties can be selectively loaded inside the NBs or on the outside of the NBs, respectively. A high-performance nanomotor is constructed by selectively loading catalytically active hydrophilic Pt NPs inside the NBs. It is also demonstrated that these NBs can be used as vessels for various reactions, such as the in situ synthesis of Au NPs, and using Au NP-loaded NBs as nanoreactors for catalytic reactions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Yi, Deliang","Zhang, Qian","Liu, Yinghua","Song, Jiaying","Tang, Yi","Caruso, Frank","Wang, Yajun","Deliang Yi","Qian Zhang","Yinghua Liu","Jiaying Song","Yi Tang","Frank Caruso","Yajun Wang"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201607330","first_seen_on":"2016-10-24T23:23:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"11343\/123199","handles":["11343\/123199"],"issns":["1521-3773","14337851"],"journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
