One option to potentially mitigate heat storage is to promote airflow under the soft body armor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of ambient air induction (\u223c100 liters per minute) on heat strain while wearing concealed soft body armor in a hot environment (wet bulb globe temperature = 30\u00b0C). A counter-balanced, repeated measures protocol was performed with nine healthy male volunteers. Participants were fitted with either a traditional or modified Level II concealed soft body armor. Participants performed cycles of 12\u00a0min of walking (1.25 liters per minute) and 3\u00a0min of arm curls (0.6 liters per minute) for a total of 60\u00a0min. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the mean differences in physiological measures (rectal temperature, heart rate, micro-environment [temperature and relative humidity]). Post hoc Bonferroni analysis and paired samples t-tests (alpha = 0.01) were conducted on omnibus significant findings. Perceptual measures (perceived exertion, thermal comfort) were analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Tests. Modification led to an improvement in perceived exertion at 45\u00a0min (MOD: 10 \u00b1 1; CON: 11 \u00b1 2; p \u2264 0.001) and 60\u00a0min (MOD: 10 \u00b1 2; CON: 12 \u00b1 2; p \u2264 0.001) and a reduction in micro-environment temperature in MOD (1.0 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C, p = 0.03) compared to CON. Modification did not attenuate change in rectal temperature or heart rate (p < 0.01) during 60-min work bout. Change in rectal temperature approached significance between MOD and CON at the end of the work bout (MOD: 0.4 \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C; CON: 0.7 \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C; p = 0.048). The slope of rectal temperature was significantly greater (p = 0.04) under CON compared to MOD. These data suggest that air induction may provide small benefits while wearing concealed soft body armor, though improvements are needed to lessen physiological strain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f61000120a","authors":["Greg A.
