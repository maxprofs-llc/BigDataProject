For efficient delivery, the R3V6 peptides were used as a carrier. The ternary complex of siS1PLyase, HMGB1A, and R3V6 was produced by charge interaction. The siS1PLyase\/HMGB1A\/R3V6 ternary complex delivered siRNA into the LA-4 lung epithelial cells more efficiently than polyethylenimine (PEI) and Lipofectamine. Furthermore, the ternary complex was non-toxic. The siS1PLyase\/HMGB1A\/R3V6 complex reduced the levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 more efficiently than HMGB1A only or siS1PLyase\/R3V6 complex in the LPS activated macrophage cells. In vivo administration of the siS1PLyase\/HMGB1A\/R3V6 complex reduced the S1PLyase level efficiently in an LPS-induced ALI model. Furthermore, the complex reduced the inflammatory response and apoptosis in the ALI model. In conclusion, siS1PLyase and HMGB1A have a synergistic therapeutic effect for the treatment of ALI. Furthermore, R3V6 is an efficient carrier for combined delivery of siS1PLyase and HMGB1A.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d37","doi":"10.1016\/j.jconrel.2013.12.008","first_seen_on":"2013-12-22T04:19:22+00:00","issns":["01683659"],"journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","last_mentioned_on":1387685955,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168365913009504"],"pmid":"24361371","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Combined delivery of HMGB-1 box A peptide and S1PLyase siRNA in animal models of acute lung injury","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combined-delivery-hmgb1-box-peptide-s1plyase-sirna-animal-models-acute-lung-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6575068,"mean":6.0979883703087,"rank":4864101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":965473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6575068,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149403,"mean":7.5980500394909,"rank":99558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":27480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149403,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2364,"mean":2.5629386373254,"rank":1396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2364,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":2.5177872340426,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JCRnEDITORS\/status\/414611062374563840","license":"public","citation_ids":[1998371],"posted_on":"2013-12-22T04:19:15+00:00","author":{"name":"J Controlled Release","url":"http:\/\/www.journals.elsevier.com\/journal-of-controlled-release\/#description","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1434589912\/jcr_normal.JPG","description":"Editors of 'Journal of Controlled Release' on all aspects of controlled release and delivery, including gene delivery, tissue engineering and diagnostic agents.","id_on_source":"JCRnEDITORS","tweeter_id":"331426970","geo":{"lt":41.59226,"ln":-87.68533,"country":"US"},"followers":1695},"tweet_id":"414611062374563840"}]}}
