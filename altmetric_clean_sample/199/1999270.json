Two hESC-based cell therapies for spinal cord injury and macular degeneration have been advanced into human clinical trials. Despite this rapid progress, one key challenge of hESC-based cell therapy is the allogeneic immune rejection of hESC-derived cells by recipients. This problem could be mitigated by a recent breakthrough in the technology of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by nuclear reprogramming of patient-specific somatic cells with defined factors, which could become a renewable source of autologous cells for cell therapy. However, recent studies revealing the abnormal epigenetics, genomic stability and immunogenicity of iPSCs have raised safety concerns over iPSC-based therapy. Recent findings related to the immunogenicity of iPSC derivatives will be summarized in this review.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e24","authors":["Xuemei Fu"],"doi":"10.1038\/cmi.2013.60","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-12-23T01:05:45+00:00","issns":["1672-7681","2042-0226"],"journal":"Cellular & Molecular Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1387814830,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cmi\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/cmi201360a.html"],"pmid":"24336164","pubdate":"2013-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The immunogenicity of cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunogenicity-cells-derived-induced-pluripotent-stem-cells-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2295982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2718567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131133,"mean":7.7649294603913,"rank":52235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":78049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131133,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":342,"mean":5.7997595307918,"rank":207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":342,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.03725,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
