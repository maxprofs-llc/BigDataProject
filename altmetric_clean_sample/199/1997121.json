The fibronectin network, which plays a pivotal role in cell-matrix interactions, is a major determinant of arterial stiffness. We hypothesized that in SAD and SNX rats, arterial stiffness is increased, due to alterations of cell-matrix anchoring leading to spatial reorganization of the extracellular matrix.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a49","doi":"10.1097\/hjh.0000000000000073","first_seen_on":"2013-12-21T05:15:00+00:00","issns":["0263-6352"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Hypertension","last_mentioned_on":1415702017,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jhypertension\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Increased_stiffness_and_cell_matrix_interactions.98652.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24356541"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jhypertension\/9000\/00000\/Increased_stiffness_and_cell_matrix_interactions.98652.pdf","pmid":"24356541","pubdate":"2013-12-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","title":"Increased stiffness and cell-matrix interactions of abdominal aorta in two experimental nonhypertensive models: long-term chemically sympathectomized and sinoaortic denervated rats.","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-stiffness-cellmatrix-interactions-abdominal-aorta-two-experimental-nonhypertensive-models"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2915342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1440968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119518,"mean":7.5677403214608,"rank":75508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":40415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119518,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1756,"mean":1.9787031339031,"rank":857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1756,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":3.1044888888889,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
