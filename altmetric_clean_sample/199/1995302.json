How N regulates NSC behavior is not well understood. Here we show that canonical N signaling cooperates with a noncanonical N signaling pathway to mediate N-directed NSC regulation. In the noncanonical pathway, N interacts with PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) to influence mitochondrial function, activating mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)\/AKT signaling. Importantly, attenuating noncanonical N signaling preferentially impaired the maintenance of Drosophila and human cancer stem cell-like tumor-forming cells. Our results emphasize the importance of mitochondria to N and NSC biology, with important implications for diseases associated with aberrant N signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["Kyu-Sun Lee","Zhihao Wu","Yan Song","Siddhartha S Mitra","Abdullah H Feroze","Samuel H Cheshier","Bingwei Lu"],"doi":"10.1101\/gad.225169.113","first_seen_on":"2013-12-20T11:13:43+00:00","funders":["niams"],"issns":["1549-5477"],"issue":"24","journal":"Genes & Development","last_mentioned_on":1388768429,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24352421?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/m.genesdev.cshlp.org\/content\/27\/24\/2642"],"pmid":"24352421","pubdate":"2013-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Roles of PINK1, mTORC2, and mitochondria in preserving brain tumor-forming stem cells in a noncanonical Notch signaling pathway.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/roles-pink1-mtorc2-mitochondria-preserving-brain-tumorforming-stem-cells-noncanonical-notch-signalin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616387,"mean":4.9300280987737,"rank":2699682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":871697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616387,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108600,"mean":7.228689969521,"rank":78863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":28363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108600,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2541,"mean":3.0152984251968,"rank":2267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2541,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":3.917,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
