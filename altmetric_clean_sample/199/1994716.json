Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can facilitate stress- and drug-induced neuroadaptation in the mesocorticolimbic system. BDNF-containing projections to the NAc originate from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the prefrontal cortex, and BDNF release activates tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In this study, we examined the necessity for BDNF-TrkB signaling in the NAc shell during social defeat stress-induced cross-sensitization to amphetamine. Adeno-associated virus expressing short hairpin RNA directed against TrkB (AAV-shTrkB) was infused bilaterally into the NAc shell to knock down TrkB, whereas AAV-GFP (green fluorescent protein) was used as the control virus. Rats were exposed to intermittent social defeat stress or handling procedures; amphetamine challenge was given at 10 days after the last defeat and locomotor activity was measured. Stressed rats that received the control virus showed cross-sensitization to amphetamine compared with the handled rats. In contrast, NAc TrkB knockdown prevented social defeat stress-induced cross-sensitization. TrkB knockdown in the NAc was found to reduce the level of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 in this region. NAc TrkB knockdown also prevented stress-induced elevation of BDNF and the glutamate receptor type 1 (GluA1) subunit of AMPA receptor in the VTA, as well as \u0394FosB expression in the NAc. These findings indicated that BDNF-TrkB signaling in the NAc shell was required for social defeat stress-induced cross-sensitization. NAc TrkB-BDNF signaling also appeared to be involved in the regulation of GluA1 in the VTA, as well as in the NAc \u0394FosB accumulation that could trigger cross-sensitization after social defeat stress.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002841","authors":["Wang, Junshi","Bina, Robert W.","Wingard, Jeffrey C.","Terwilliger, Ernest F.","Hammer, Ronald P.","Nikulina, Ella M."],"doi":"10.1111\/ejn.12464","endpage":"1017","first_seen_on":"2013-12-20T04:27:58+00:00","issns":["1460-9568","0953-816X"],"issue":"6","journal":"European Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1387587218,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ejn.12464\/abstract;jsessionid=A794210FA73305A8D2C5AA73424636EA.f03t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ejn.12464\/abstract;jsessionid=40364BEEEDCF007F59524114BC7D99AA.f04t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ejn.12464\/pdf","pmid":"24354924","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1009","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Knockdown of tropomyosin\u2010related kinase B receptor expression in the nucleus accumbens shell prevents intermittent social defeat stress\u2010induced cross\u2010sensitisation to amphetamine in rats","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/knockdown-tropomyosinrelated-kinase-b-receptor-expression-nucleus-accumbens-shell-prevents-intermitt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6333733,"mean":5.9768338590895,"rank":2979488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1894902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6333733,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145270,"mean":7.5867548341355,"rank":70747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":54507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145270,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2162,"mean":3.7142230448866,"rank":1300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2162,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.1525,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
