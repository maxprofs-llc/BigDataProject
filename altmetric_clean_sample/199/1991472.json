The HLA-C 3'UTR variant was shown to associate with HIV control, but like the vast majority of disease associations in a region dense with causal candidates, a direct effect of HLA-C expression level on HIV control was not proven. We demonstrate that a MIR148A insertion\/deletion polymorphism associates with its own expression levels, affecting the extent to which HLA-C is down-regulated, the level of HIV control, and the risk of Crohn disease only among those carrying an intact miR-148a binding site in the HLA-C 3'UTR. These data illustrate a direct effect of HLA-C expression level on HIV control that cannot be attributed to other HLA loci in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-C and highlight the rich complexity of genetic interactions in human disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Smita Kulkarni","Ying Qi","Colm O\u2019hUigin","Florencia Pereyra","Veron Ramsuran","Paul McLaren","Jacques Fellay","George Nelson","Haoyan Chen","Wilson Liao","Sara Bass","Richard Apps","Xiaojiang Gao","Yuko Yuki","Alexandra Lied","Anuradha Ganesan","Peter W.
