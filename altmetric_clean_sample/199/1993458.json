Characterization of these genetic groups is likely to facilitate and contribute to the development of an effective vaccine against infection with HCV. Differences among HCV genotypes in geographic distributions have provided investigators with an epidemiologic marker that can be used to trace the source of HCV infection in a given population. HCV genotype 1 may represent a more aggressive strain and one that is less likely to respond to interferon treatment than HCV genotype 2 or 3. However, these observations require confirmation before HCV genotyping can be used in clinical settings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f0b","authors":["Nizar N.
