Clinical decision support (CDS) represents a promising approach to not only improve care but to reduce costs in the inpatient setting. The purpose of this study was to systematically review trials of CDS interventions with the potential to reduce inpatient costs, so as to identify promising interventions for more widespread implementation and to inform future research in this area.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c4","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6947-13-135","first_seen_on":"2013-12-21T02:52:57+00:00","issns":["1472-6947"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making","last_mentioned_on":1405649234,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6947\/13\/135\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6947\/13\/135","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6947-13-135.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3878492\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6947-13-135.pdf","pmid":"24344752","pubdate":"2013-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Geomatic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"135","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Systematic review of clinical decision support interventions with potential for inpatient cost reduction","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-review-clinical-decision-support-interventions-potential-inpatient-cost-reduction-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":1191508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3821959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130333,"mean":7.7344573090264,"rank":33669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":96089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130333,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":814,"mean":4.1381426814268,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":814,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":4.2342105263158,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
