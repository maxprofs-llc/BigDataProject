Zinc accumulation diminishes early in the course of prostate malignancy and it inhibits the growth of several carcinoma cells through induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In this study, we have investigated the influence of zinc on N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and testosterone (T)-induced prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in the dorsolateral prostate of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The results indicate that zinc plays an important role in prostate carcinogenesis. Increased tumor incidence was accompanied by a decrease in prostatic acid phosphatase activity, citrate, zinc, glutathione-S-transferase, reduced glutathione, p53, B-cell lymphoma protein (Bcl-2)-associated X protein and caspase-3 levels in MNU + T-treated rats. On the contrary, significantly increased phase I drug metabolizing enzyme activities, lipid peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) protein levels were observed in the dorsolateral prostate of MNU + T-treated rats. Simultaneous zinc supplementation significantly reversed these effects in MNU + T-treated rats. Signs of dysplasia, a characteristic of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, were evident in the dorsolateral prostatic tissue sections by MNU + T administration. However, zinc supplementation has reversed these effects in the dorsolateral prostatic histoarchitecture. These results suggest that zinc may act as an essential trace element against MNU and testosterone-induced prostatic preneoplastic progression in SD rats.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b7","doi":"10.1258\/ebm.2011.010392","first_seen_on":"2011-08-31T07:00:21+00:00","issns":["1535-3699"],"journal":"Experimental Biology and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1314772015,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21865407"],"pmid":"21865407","pubdate":"2011-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology","physiology"],"title":"Protective effect of zinc on N-methyl-N-nitrosourea and testosterone-induced prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in the dorsolateral prostate of Sprague Dawley rats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protective-effect-zinc-ini-methyl-ini-nitrosourea-testosteroneinduced-prostatic-intraepithelial-neop"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2979716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1395789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62829,"mean":4.7439357611256,"rank":36637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":24287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62829,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":530,"mean":2.8369224952741,"rank":299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":530,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.4,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/drgregemerson\/status\/108787834118344704","citation_ids":[249385],"posted_on":"2011-08-31T06:26:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Greg Emerson","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_2_normal.png","description":"","id_on_source":"drgregemerson","tweeter_id":"78307294","followers":55},"tweet_id":"108787834118344704"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Protective effect of zinc on N-methyl...
