Cytotoxicity of SC-1 in Hep 3B cells was through the process of apoptosis characterizing by increase in cell population of sub-G(1) phase, fragmentation of DNA, and change of nuclear morphology. Treatment of Hep 3B cells with SC-1 activated caspase 8 and caspase 3. Elevation of nuclear DNA fragmentation factor 40 (DFF40) and cleavage form of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were also observed. SC-1 also activated intrinsic pathway via increase of pro-apoptotic (tBid, Bak and Bax) and decrease of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L)) proteins on mitochondria, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase\/direct IAP binding protein with low PI) from mitochondria, and activation of caspase 9. Inhibition on protein expression of Ku70 in cytosol and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, but not COX-1, in whole cell lystes were revealed in SC-1-treated Hep 3B cells. These results suggest caspase 8, Ku70 and mitochondria are involved in the antitumor mechanism of SC-1 in Hep 3B cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f2","doi":"10.1016\/j.fct.2006.07.031","first_seen_on":"2011-08-25T17:53:15+00:00","issns":["02786915"],"journal":"Food & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1282396285,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T6P-4KSVCD1-2&_user=10&_coverDate=02%2F28%2F2007&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor&view=c&_searchStrId=1437434993&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=03012906a5653236cfb5239402e5b78c"],"pmid":"17030378","pubdate":"2006-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Supernatant of bacterial fermented soybean induces apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep 3B cells via activation of caspase 8 and mitochondria","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/supernatant-bacterial-fermented-soybean-induces-apoptosis-human-hepatocellular-carcinoma-hep-3b-cell"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624910,"mean":4.93387576623,"rank":2906081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624910,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58722,"mean":4.4807251579503,"rank":40452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58722,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1114,"mean":6.8009110512129,"rank":832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1114,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.3072222222222,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
