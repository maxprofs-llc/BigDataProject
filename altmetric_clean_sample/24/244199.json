It is of considerable interest that the AuNPs generate and self-assemble with raw, ordinary PS microspheres that preexist in the oxidation-reduction systems. The synthesized AuNPs-coated PS composite particles have been extensively characterized using scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy. The results indicate that the morphology of the resultant composite particles is governed by simply changing the amount and type of reductants and the concentration of PS microspheres. The AuNPs-coated PS composite particles also exhibit the good surface-enhanced Raman scattering and catalytic performances.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008096","authors":["Li, Yunxing","Pan, Yunfei","Zhu, Lili","Wang, Zhaoqun","Su, Dongmeng","Xue, Gi"],"doi":"10.1002\/marc.201100377","endpage":"1747","first_seen_on":"2011-08-24T11:27:34+00:00","issns":["1521-3927","1022-1336"],"issue":"21","journal":"Macromolecular Rapid Communications","last_mentioned_on":1314183885,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/marc.201100377"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201100377\/pdf","pmid":"21858894","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"1741","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Facile and Controlled Fabrication of Functional Gold Nanoparticle\u00e2\u0080\u0090coated Polystyrene Composite Particle","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facile-controlled-fabrication-functional-gold-nanoparticlecoated-polystyrene-composite-particle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6378189,"mean":5.9866683057946,"rank":5432876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6378189,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66446,"mean":5.6086597938144,"rank":56571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66446,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":854,"mean":1.8225885111372,"rank":575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":854,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.275,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
