We used chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection of cynomolgus macaques to determine the dynamics of peripheral blood B cell alterations in this model of HIV infection. During the course of infection, we observed progressive loss of total and memory (CD27+) B cells, increased percentages of activated (CD95+) B cells, hypergammaglobulinemia, and deficits in the CD21+ B cell population. In addition, we noted declines in subsets of memory B cells, including both IgM+ and class-switched (IgD-IgM- CD27+) cells, with sustained deficits in the IgM+ memory (IgM+CD27+) B cell population. The similarity of the B cell alterations in these studies to those observed in HIV+ subjects supports the utility of the SHIV macaque model for examination of HIV-related B cell dysfunction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f7b","first_seen_on":"2011-08-20T01:58:33+00:00","funders":["niaid","nhlbi"],"issns":["1532-0820"],"issue":"3","journal":"Comparative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1313810070,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21819698?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21819698","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","laboratoryanimalscience"],"title":"Alterations in Peripheral Blood B-cell Populations in SHIV89.6P-infected Macaques (Macacca fascicularis).","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alterations-peripheral-blood-bcell-populations-shiv896pinfected-macaques-macacca-fascicularis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2672563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62893,"mean":5.293622909114,"rank":29556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":21821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62893,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":2.5655966386555,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.48,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/HIV_Wisdom\/status\/104731992255500288","citation_ids":[241114],"posted_on":"2011-08-20T01:50:27+00:00","author":{"name":"OrganizedWisdom HIV","url":"http:\/\/organizedwisdom.com\/Category:HIV","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/63134270\/twitter_image_normal.png","description":"Organizing HIV resources shared by health experts, advocates, and organizations into WisdomCards.\r\n","id_on_source":"hiv_wisdom","tweeter_id":"17052443","followers":333},"tweet_id":"104731992255500288"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/id_ezy\/status\/104753144663252992","citation_ids":[241114],"posted_on":"2011-08-20T03:14:30+00:00","author":{"name":"idezy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1368248942\/ip_microbes_normal.jpg","description":"Information about Infectious diseases around the world.","id_on_source":"id_ezy","tweeter_id":"304910533","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":59},"tweet_id":"104753144663252992"}]}}
