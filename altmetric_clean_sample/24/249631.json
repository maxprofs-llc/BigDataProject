By labeling proteins either directly or via SNAP tags with photoswitchable dyes, we obtained two-dimensional (2D) and 3D super-resolution images of living cells, using clathrin-coated pits and the transferrin cargo as model systems. Bright, fast-switching probes enabled us to achieve 2D imaging at spatial resolutions of \u223c25 nm and temporal resolutions as fast as 0.5 s. We also demonstrated live-cell 3D super-resolution imaging. We obtained 3D spatial resolution of \u223c30 nm in the lateral direction and \u223c50 nm in the axial direction at time resolutions as fast as 1-2 s with several independent snapshots. Using photoswitchable dyes with distinct emission wavelengths, we also demonstrated two-color 3D super-resolution imaging in live cells. These imaging capabilities open a new window for characterizing cellular structures in living cells at the ultrastructural level.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000426c","authors":["Sara A Jones","Sang-Hee Shim","Jiang He","Xiaowei Zhuang"],"doi":"10.1038\/nmeth.1605","endpage":"505","first_seen_on":"2011-08-31T14:12:43+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1548-7091","1548-7105"],"journal":"Nature Methods","last_mentioned_on":1469788158,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nmeth\/journal\/v8\/n6\/full\/nmeth.1605.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nmeth.1605","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21552254","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3137767"],"pmid":"21552254","pubdate":"2011-05-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"499","subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Fast three-dimensional super-resolution imaging of live cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fast-threedimensional-superresolution-imaging-live-cells-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.68,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.68},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154593,"mean":6.8923629076653,"rank":706389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7448239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154593,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77825,"mean":5.9253756424753,"rank":7302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":70523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77825,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2820,"mean":20.603892869812,"rank":995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":1822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2820,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":15.297049180328,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":30,"Researcher":187,"Student  > Ph.
