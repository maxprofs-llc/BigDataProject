This study was designed as a prospective randomized controlled study. Eighty patients (female 52\/male 28) admitted to a physical medicine and rehabilitation outpatient clinic diagnosed as MPS were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups. Group 1 (n = 40) received local anesthetic injection (2 ml lidocaine of 1%) and group 2 (n = 40) received dry injecting on trigger points. Both patient groups were given stretching exercises aimed at the trapezius muscle to be applied at home. Patients were evaluated according to pain, cervical ROM, and depression. Pain was assessed using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and active cervical ROM was measured using goniometry. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to assess the level of depression. There were no statistically significant differences in the pre-treatment evaluation parameters of the patients. There were statistically significant improvements in VAS, cervical ROM, and BDI scores after 4 and 12 weeks in both groups compared to pre-treatment results (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the groups (p > 0.05). Our study indicated that exercise associated with local anesthetic and dry needling injections were effective in decrease of pain level in MPS as well as increase of cervical ROM and decrease of depressive mood levels of individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002579","authors":["Saime Ay","Deniz Evcik","Birkan Sonel Tur"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10067-009-1307-8","endpage":"23","first_seen_on":"2011-08-22T04:29:24+00:00","issns":["0770-3198","1434-9949"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1313487626,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/t83t274722220637\/"],"pmid":"19838864","pubdate":"2009-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"19","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Comparison of injection methods in myofascial pain syndrome: a randomized controlled trial","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-injection-methods-myofascial-pain-syndrome-randomized-controlled-trial-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":2899729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58409,"mean":4.4470864607588,"rank":39713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58409,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":533,"mean":2.6529962406015,"rank":416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":533,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.05,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":13,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
