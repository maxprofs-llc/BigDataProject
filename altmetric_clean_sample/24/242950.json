Under this initiative, osteopathic medical students are provided with 26 hours of supervised experience in osteopathic palpatory diagnosis and osteopathic manipulative treatment. The educational goal of the clinic is to increase the confidence of osteopathic medical students in their technical abilities in using osteopathic manipulative medicine to diagnose and treat community patients. Based on a variety of results from student-completed surveys, the authors conclude that the osteopathic manipulative medicine student clinic at West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine has met its goal of increasing student confidence in the application of these skills.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005abd","first_seen_on":"2011-08-23T00:07:59+00:00","issns":["0098-6151"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of the American Osteopathic Association","last_mentioned_on":1314052827,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16368914"],"pmid":"16368914","pubdate":"2005-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["osteopathicmedicine"],"title":"Community-based osteopathic manipulative medicine student clinic: changes in curriculum and student confidence levels.","type":"article","volume":"105","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/communitybased-osteopathic-manipulative-medicine-student-clinic-changes-curriculum-student-confidenc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":2906299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58490,"mean":4.4858556651678,"rank":40194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58490,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":349,"mean":2.629,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":349,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.0833333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
