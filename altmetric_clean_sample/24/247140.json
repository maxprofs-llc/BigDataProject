In the present study, we report the findings that 2 of 15 patients with refractory\/relapsed APL treated with As\u2082O\u2083 were clinically As\u2082O\u2083 resistant. Leukemia cells from these 2 patients harbored missense mutations in promyelocytic leukemia gene-retinoic acid receptor-\u03b1 gene (PML-RARA) transcripts, resulting in amino acid substitutions of A216V and L218P in the PML B2 domain. When wild-type or mutated PML-RARA (PR-WT and PR-B\/L-mut, respectively) were overexpressed in HeLa cells, immunoblotting showed SUMOylated and\/or oligomerized protein bands in PR-WT but not in PR-B\/L-mut after As\u2082O\u2083 treatment. Protein-localization analysis indicated that PR-WT in the soluble fraction was transferred to the insoluble fraction after treatment with As\u2082O\u2083, but PR-B\/L-mut was stably detected in fractions both with and without As\u2082O\u2083. Immunofluorescent microscopy analysis showed PR-WT localization as a microgranular pattern in the cytoplasm without As\u2082O\u2083 and as a macrogranular pattern with As\u2082O\u2083. PR-B\/L-mut was diffusely observed in the cytoplasm with and without As\u2082O\u2083. Nearly identical localization patterns were observed in patients' primary cells. Therefore, B2 domain mutations may play an important role in aberrant molecular responses toAs\u2082O\u2083 and may be critical for As\u2082O\u2083 resistance in APL.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","doi":"10.1182\/blood-2011-01-329433","first_seen_on":"2011-08-28T01:56:14+00:00","issns":["1528-0020"],"issue":"6","journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1314487097,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21613260"],"pmid":"21613260","pubdate":"2011-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Missense mutations in PML-RARA are critical for the lack of responsiveness to arsenic trioxide treatment.","type":"article","volume":"118","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/missense-mutations-pmlrara-critical-lack-responsiveness-arsenic-trioxide-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2979772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1395716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62272,"mean":4.7868589230942,"rank":36412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":23984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62272,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7808,"mean":2.8587777635455,"rank":5411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7808,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128,"mean":2.3617952755906,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
