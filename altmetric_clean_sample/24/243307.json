This exercise has proven the effectiveness of numerous modern therapeutic techniques that have been adapted into modern medicine with remarkable success. While it is certain that many of these techniques yield beneficial results, the mechanisms by which these results are achieved have not been fully realized. In the present report, we consider the case of osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM), which represents a therapeutic technique developed over a century ago as a means of non-invasive treatment for numerous ailments. Our intention is to use current findings from our laboratory, as well as those of our colleagues in the area of nitric oxide (NO) research to explain the mechanism through which osteopathic manipulations aid the patient. These reports demonstrate that fluidic motions applied to vascular and nerve tissue in a manner comparable to manipulations can cause a remarkable increase in NO concentration within the blood and vasculature. These findings combined with the overwhelming amount of research into the beneficial effects of constitutive NO provide a dynamic theoretical framework to explain the therapeutic effects of OMM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f61000795e","authors":["Salamon E","Zhu W","Stefano GB"],"first_seen_on":"2011-08-23T09:39:17+00:00","issns":["1107-3756"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1352062691,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15289898"],"pmid":"15289898","pubdate":"2004-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Nitric oxide as a possible mechanism for understanding the therapeutic effects of osteopathic manipulative medicine (Review).","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nitric-oxide-possible-mechanism-understanding-therapeutic-effects-osteopathic-manipulative-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":2740220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":734649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58520,"mean":4.4344914984876,"rank":34842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":18914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58520,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":654,"mean":1.8885513016845,"rank":433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":654,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.5,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Lecturer":2,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BE":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=437610866286201&id=179186882128602","citation_ids":[1041548,243307],"posted_on":"2012-11-04T20:58:11+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21518271\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15289898\n\nMerci beaucoup","author":{"name":"Pierre Quirion","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/179186882128602","facebook_wall_name":"\u00c9change d'articles et publications scientifiques","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/179186882128602\/picture","id_on_source":"179186882128602"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/swissfund\/status\/105932713940357120","citation_ids":[243307],"posted_on":"2011-08-23T09:21:41+00:00","author":{"name":"swissfund","url":"http:\/\/www.sfebom.eu","image":"http:\/\/a1.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1300586070\/Schermafbeelding_2011-04-05_om_10.45.54_normal.png","description":"One of the major objectives of the SFEBOM is the financial support of initiatives within the osteopathy ","id_on_source":"swissfund","tweeter_id":"213665613","geo":{"lt":50.812835,"ln":3.332955,"country":"BE"},"followers":100},"tweet_id":"105932713940357120"}]}}
