P.; Dubeck, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963, 85, 1544), no examples of catalysis using nickel complexes have been reported. In this work, the Ni-catalyzed transformation of ortho C-H bonds utilizing chelation assistance, such as oxidative cycloaddition of aromatic amides with alkynes, has been achieved.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Hirotaka Shiota","Yusuke Ano","Yoshinori Aihara","Yoshiya Fukumoto","Naoto Chatani"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja206850s","first_seen_on":"2011-08-30T01:09:53+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1315671120,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja206850s"],"pmid":"21875095","pubdate":"2011-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"110829144922009","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Nickel-Catalyzed Chelation-Assisted Transformations Involving the ortho C-H Bond Activation: The Regioselective Oxidative Cycloaddition of Aromatic Amides to Alkynes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nickelcatalyzed-chelationassisted-transformations-involving-ortho-ch-bond-activation-regioselective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.624,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.624},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5040289,"mean":5.9643426109799,"rank":515420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4524484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5040289,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64380,"mean":5.2659267773653,"rank":7097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":57283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64380,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15536,"mean":4.5775540392662,"rank":1586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":13944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15536,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314,"mean":5.8963258785942,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
