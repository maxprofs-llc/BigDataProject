The MD simulation data have been analyzed to provide information about the crystallization process of polymer adsorbed on the solid substrate. The isothermal crystallization of PE proceeds in two steps: (1) adsorption and (2) orientation. The results detail the radial density distribution function, ordered parameters, local bond-orientational order parameters, and the local properties displayed in layers of the polymer parallel to the graphite and vacuum interfaces. It was also shown that the film thickness affected the critical crystallization temperature of the adsorbed polymer on the substrate surface. Furthermore, the influence of the graphite surface area on the crystallization of PE is discussed by comparing the crystallinity evolution of PE on graphite with different coverage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008518","first_seen_on":"2011-08-29T16:07:03+00:00","issns":["1550-2376"],"issue":"1-1","journal":"Physical Review E: Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics","last_mentioned_on":1314626250,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21867201?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21867201","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biophysics","physiology","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Induced crystallization of single-chain polyethylene on a graphite surface: Molecular dynamics simulation.","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/induced-crystallization-singlechain-polyethylene-graphite-surface-molecular-dynamics-simulation-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":985340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62268,"mean":4.8122646987971,"rank":39456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":14723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62268,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5151,"mean":1.6749809708738,"rank":2426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5151,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177,"mean":1.2655454545455,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/NicholasMMurphy\/status\/108176452251418624","citation_ids":[248020],"posted_on":"2011-08-29T13:57:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Nick Murphy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/978677061\/345_n_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"nicholasmmurphy","tweeter_id":"74478819","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":814},"tweet_id":"108176452251418624"}]}}
