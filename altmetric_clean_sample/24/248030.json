FU40. Several members of this family are potent and remarkably selective inducers of apoptosis in cancer cell lines, likely via a distinct mitochondria associated target. To investigate the biosynthesis of this natural product, the complete genome of the apoptolidin producer Nocardiopsis sp. FU40 was sequenced and a 116 Kb region was identified containing a putative apoptolidin biosynthetic gene cluster. The apoptolidin gene cluster comprises a type I polyketide synthase, with 13 homologating modules, apparently initiated in an unprecedented fashion via transfer from a methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein loading module. Spanning approximately 39 open reading frames, the gene cluster was cloned into a series of overlapping cosmids and functionally validated by targeted gene disruption experiments in the producing organism. Disruption of putative PKS and P(450) genes delineated the roles of these genes in apoptolidin biosynthesis and chemical complementation studies demonstrated intact biosynthesis peripheral to the disrupted genes. This work provides insight into details of the biosynthesis of this biologically significant natural product and provides a basis for future mutasynthetic methods for the generation of non-natural apopotolidins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000362c","authors":["Du Y","Derewacz DK","Deguire SM","Teske J","Ravel J","Sulikowski GA","Bachmann BO"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tet.2011.05.106","endpage":"6575","first_seen_on":"2011-08-29T16:07:52+00:00","funders":["nci","nigms"],"issns":["0040-4020","00404020"],"issue":"35","journal":"Tetrahedron","last_mentioned_on":1314625159,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21869849"],"pmid":"21869849","pubdate":"2011-09-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"6568","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Biosynthesis of the Apoptolidins in Nocardiopsis sp.
