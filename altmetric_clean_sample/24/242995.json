Using a retrospective analysis, the current study aimed at identifying the specific indicators related to return to work in adults with both symptomatic MTBI and functional impacts, having completed a specialized intervention program. In terms of outcome, 59.1% of the cohort (n=110) returned to some form of work-related activity by the end of intervention whereas the rest had not. Three of the sixteen variables studied were retained (logistic regression) as providing unique and significant (p<0.05) contributions to the prediction outcome model, namely age, number of subjective symptoms and the presence of a public insurance provider. There was also an interaction between the presence of a public insurance provider and referral delay. Overall percentage of cases correctly classified by the model was 70%, positive predictive accuracy was 72.9%, whereas negative predictive accuracy was 65%. Our findings suggest that any studies attempting to assess functional outcome need to take account of the multifactorial nature of MTBI, including not only more objective psychological\/physiological variables related to the injury, but also subjective complaints and environmental factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a9","first_seen_on":"2011-08-23T00:09:13+00:00","issns":["1053-8135"],"issue":"4","journal":"NeuroRehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1314049027,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17361046"],"pmid":"17361046","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOS Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","neurology"],"title":"Vocational outcome indicators in atypically recovering mild TBI: a post-intervention study.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vocational-outcome-indicators-atypically-recovering-mild-tbi-postintervention-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":2326133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1538849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61465,"mean":4.833367271899,"rank":26846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":24741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61465,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256,"mean":3.3870745098039,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.725,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
