Northern blot was used to detect bcl-6 and lpp mRNA expression in 8 DLBCL cell lines. Solution hybridization was used to measure miR-28 expression, and Western blot was performed for BCL-6 and LPP protein determinations. The results showed that the expression of bcl-6 mRNA was higher in the cell lines with Ig\/BCL-6 translocation (Oc1-ly8, MD903, CTB-1, and MD901), and negative in those without Ig\/BCL-6 translocation (HRC57 and K231). The expression of lpp mRNA in CTB-1 cell line was negative. MiR-28 was positive in all cell lines, and the expression levels from high to low were in line as follows: K231, CTB-1, MD903, HRC57, MD901, RCK8, OC1-LY8 and BEVA. BCL-6 protein was also positive in all of cell lines, and the expression levels from high to low were as follows: RCK8, BEVA, MD901, CTB-1, MD903, OC1-LY8, HRC57 and K231. LPP protein was negative in K231 cells, and the expression levels in other cells from high to low were line up as follows: HRC57, OC1-LY8, BEVA, RCK8, CTB-1, MD901 and MD903. The expression levels of bcl-6 and lpp mRNA were not consistent with expression levels of protein. It is concluded that the gene expression levels of bcl-6, lpp and miR-28 are different in various DLBCL cell lines. The expression levels of bcl-6 and lpp mRNA are not parallel with expression levels of protein. The roles of bcl-6, lpp and miR-28 in initiation and development of DLBCL need further investigation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcfa","authors":["Xu W","Li JY","Fan L","Qiao C","Yu H","Shen QD"],"first_seen_on":"2011-08-25T12:40:31+00:00","issns":["1009-2137"],"issue":"1","journal":"Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi","last_mentioned_on":1341838161,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19236753?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19236753"],"pmid":"19236753","pubdate":"2009-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"[Expressions of bcl-6, lpp and miR-28 genes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines].","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expressions-bcl6-lpp-mir28-genes-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma-cell-lines-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":920659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3570658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61744,"mean":4.8289766613219,"rank":12733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":48631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61744,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":0.77473684210526,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.05,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/NicholasMMurphy\/status\/106685907880521728","citation_ids":[245107],"posted_on":"2011-08-25T11:14:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Nick Murphy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/978677061\/345_n_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"nicholasmmurphy","tweeter_id":"74478819","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":814},"tweet_id":"106685907880521728"}],"wikipedia":[{"title":"Mir-28 microRNA precursor family","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=501390478#altmetric_citation_20","license":"public","citation_ids":[245107],"posted_on":"2012-07-09T12:49:21+00:00","summary":"In molecular biology mir-28 microRNA is a short RNA molecule.
