The wetting temperature was found to be ~310 K, while the onset of prewetting happens around the much higher temperature of 354 K. The static (hydrogen-bond populations, density profiles, energy per molecule) and dynamic (diffusion coefficients) properties of water in the stable phases in this temperature range were also studied and compared to those of water on graphene. The results indicate that hydrophobicity of boron nitride is milder than that of graphene.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008518","first_seen_on":"2011-08-30T02:33:33+00:00","issns":["1550-2376"],"issue":"1-1","journal":"Physical Review E: Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics","last_mentioned_on":1314669748,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21867179?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21867179","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biophysics","physiology","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Wetting and prewetting of water on top of a single sheet of hexagonal boron nitride.","type":"article","volume":"84","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wetting-prewetting-water-top-single-sheet-hexagonal-boron-nitride"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3111567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1005342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62528,"mean":4.7693747980872,"rank":39064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":17164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62528,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5151,"mean":1.6583518446602,"rank":2387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5151,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178,"mean":1.1341016949153,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
