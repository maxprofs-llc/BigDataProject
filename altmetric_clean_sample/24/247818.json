Serious video games show promise of changing dietary and physical activity behaviors, but research is needed on the optimal design of behavior-change procedures in video games, the mechanisms that account for changes obtained, and the groups in which these interventions work best. Such research will permit the optimal design of serious video games for diabetes and obesity prevention in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c3b","first_seen_on":"2011-08-29T10:45:21+00:00","issns":["1932-2968"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Diabetes Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1314612200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21527086?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21527086","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Diabetes Technology Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Behavioral science in video games for children's diet and physical activity change: key research needs.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/behavioral-science-video-games-childrens-diet-physical-activity-change-key-research-needs-11"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":3083480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":854722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62275,"mean":5.0541709541702,"rank":40636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":9589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62275,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":4.9224252491694,"rank":202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
