The reader will find the basic principles for the structural design and preparation methods of the materials. Moreover, the self-assembly into superstructures of higher order will be highlighted. Finally, some potential applications will be described.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ee","authors":["Minseok Kwak","Andreas Herrmann","Kwak M","Herrmann A"],"doi":"10.1039\/c1cs15138j","first_seen_on":"2011-08-22T19:35:50+00:00","issns":["1460-4744","0306-0012"],"issue":"12","journal":"Chemical Society Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1314040190,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2011\/CS\/c1cs15138j"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2011\/cs\/c1cs15138j","pmid":"21858338","pubdate":"2011-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"5745","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Nucleic acid amphiphiles: synthesis and self-assembled nanostructures","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/xlink.rsc.org\/?DOI=c1cs15138j","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nucleic-acid-amphiphiles-synthesis-selfassembled-nanostructures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627074,"mean":4.9506160212417,"rank":2018595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627074,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58387,"mean":4.4891003322714,"rank":24476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":24531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58387,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":800,"mean":2.4877847309136,"rank":409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":800,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.5174166666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
