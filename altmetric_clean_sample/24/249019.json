Currently no efficient strategy to remove CTCs from peripheral blood in order to lower the risk of metastases or tumor recurrence exists. Photodynamic treatment (PDT) using aminolevulinic acid (ALA) induced protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as photosensitizer offers an innovative approach to overcome this problem. This study aims at providing basic evidence towards fluorescence detection and photodynamic depletion of scattered cancer cells from blood preparations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007fef","authors":["Ziegler, Verena G.","Knaup, Julia","Stahl, Dorothea","Krammer, Barbara","Plaetzer, Kristjan"],"doi":"10.1002\/lsm.21089","endpage":"556","first_seen_on":"2011-08-30T21:16:00+00:00","issns":["1096-9101","0196-8092"],"issue":"7","journal":"Lasers in Surgery and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1314731551,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lsm.21089\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lsm.21089\/pdf","pmid":"22057482","pubdate":"2011-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"548","subjects":["medicine","generalsurgery"],"title":"Fluorescence detection and depletion of T47D breast cancer cells from human mononuclear cell\u00e2\u0080\u0090enriched blood preparations by photodynamic treatment: Basic in vitro experiments towards the removal of circulating tumor cells","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fluorescence-detection-depletion-t47d-breast-cancer-cells-human-mononuclear-cellenriched-blood-prepa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6378189,"mean":5.9866683057946,"rank":3007729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1907396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6378189,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67171,"mean":5.5758572577043,"rank":32100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":22344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67171,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":348,"mean":4.3893141210375,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":348,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.94444444444444,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
