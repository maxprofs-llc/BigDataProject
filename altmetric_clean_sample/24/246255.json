The median age at HCT was 52 years. Of the 32 patients for whom the allograft was performed as a first transplant, 15 (47%) had their allograft less than 1 year from diagnosis, while for the 63 patients who had an allograft following an autograft, nine (14%) were allografted within 1 year post-diagnosis (p < 0.001). The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 19% at 1 year post-transplant. At 5 years post-transplant the overall survival (OS) was 40% and progression-free survival (PFS) was 23%, with no apparent survival plateau. Three factors were independently favorable predictors of OS in a Cox regression model: immunoglobulin G (IgG) myeloma (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.75, p = 0.004), a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor (HR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.74, p = 0.005), and less than 1 year between MM diagnosis and RIC HCT (HR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.12-0.59, p = 0.001). Patterns of outcome indicate that RIC HCT may offer the potential for cure for only a small group of patients with MM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["Nivison-Smith I","Dodds AJ","Doocey R","Ganly P","Gibson J","Ma DD","Simpson JM","Szer J","Bradstock KF","Ian Nivison-Smith","Anthony J.
