The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the type and severity of chronic pain among overweight\/obese Hispanic adults aged 40 years and older, and (2) to determine the association between chronic pain indices and key demographic variables, including excessive weight. Hispanic adults (N=101) were interviewed using validated questionnaires and measured for BMI and waist circumference. Data analyses revealed that most participants had widespread pain; 60% were suffering severe pain (including back, knee, and shoulder pain); the most common pain location was head (headache, 80%), followed by knee and upper back (75-76%), shoulder (73%) and lower back (73%). Greater obesity was associated with some negative pain outcomes. Results are relevant for pain management with this at-risk population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a43","doi":"10.1353\/hpu.2011.0092","first_seen_on":"2011-08-24T05:54:58+00:00","issns":["1548-6869"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of health care for the poor and underserved (Online)","last_mentioned_on":1324247032,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21841294?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21841294","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Typology of chronic pain among overweight mexican americans.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/typology-chronic-pain-among-overweight-mexican-americans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":1936251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2530186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61859,"mean":4.8862869798571,"rank":21304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":39846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61859,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":361,"mean":2.5843888888889,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":361,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.7,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
