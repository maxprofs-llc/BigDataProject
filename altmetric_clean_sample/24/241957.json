This article describes lessons learned from a multiyear, working collaboration among neuroscientists, developmental psychologists, pediatricians, economists, and communications researchers who are engaged in the iterative construction of a core story of development, using simplifying models (i.e., metaphors) such as \"brain architecture,\"toxic stress,\" and \"serve and return\" to explain complex scientific concepts to nonscientists. The aim of this article is to stimulate more systematic, empirical approaches to the task of knowledge transfer and to underscore the need to view the translation of science into policy and practice as an important academic endeavor in its own right.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4c93cf058f61000013c","authors":["Shonkoff, Jack P.","Bales, Susan Nall","Jack P.
