We analyzed the significance of ZAC in the development of a rare, usually benign tumor of the adrenal gland: pheochromocytoma (PCC). Twenty-four PCCs were analyzed for the loss of the active nonimprinted allele of ZAC, and nine of the twenty-four PCCs were also assayed for expression of the protein. In thirteen of the cases, a paired nonmalignant tissue was available for analysis. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction revealed frequent (15 of 23, 65%) loss of unmethylated DNA in the imprinting control region of ZAC. Immunohistochemistry identified reduced ZAC expression in 56% (5 of 9) of the subset cases. Four of the five PCC cases where reduced expression of ZAC was observed were also positive for the loss of the active ZAC allele. Additionally, the loss of ZAC expression was also found to be frequent in a series of capillary hemangioblastomas and gliomas (6 of 6, 100%, and 17 of 27, 63%, respectively) examined for comparison. In conclusion, our study suggests the involvement of the imprinted ZAC gene in the pathogenesis of PCC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dce","doi":"10.1016\/j.cancergen.2011.07.002","first_seen_on":"2011-08-30T17:46:52+00:00","issns":["2210-7762"],"issue":"7","journal":"Cancer Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1314720220,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21872827?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21872827","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Tumor suppressor gene ZAC\/PLAGL1: altered expression and loss of the nonimprinted allele in pheochromocytomas.","type":"article","volume":"204","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumor-suppressor-gene-zacplagl1-altered-expression-loss-nonimprinted-allele-pheochromocytomas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":982166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62528,"mean":4.8046458330001,"rank":39712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":14042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62528,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":1.1131782945736,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
