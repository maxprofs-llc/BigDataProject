Girls benefited from computer use more than boys, and Black children benefited more than White children. Greater computer use in middle childhood was associated with increased achievement for White and Black girls, and for Black but not White boys. Increased video game play was associated with an improved ability to solve applied problems for Black girls but lower verbal achievement for all girls. For boys, increased video game play was linked to increased aggressive behavior problems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4c93cf058f61000013c","doi":"10.1111\/j.1467-8624.2010.01494.x","first_seen_on":"2011-08-30T04:16:36+00:00","issns":["1467-8624"],"issue":"5","journal":"Child Development","last_mentioned_on":1314676968,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20840243?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20840243"],"pmid":"20840243","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Home media and children's achievement and behavior.","type":"article","volume":"81","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/home-media-childrens-achievement-behavior"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.924,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.924},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":512531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3993494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62528,"mean":4.7581788347434,"rank":7838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":54690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62528,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1358,"mean":8.3758761974945,"rank":300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":1058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1358,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":4.2309230769231,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
