The negative tension created by cell division provokes a buckling instability at a finite wave vector leading to the formation of periodic arrays of villi and crypts. The instability is similar to the buckling of a metallic plate under compression. We use the results to rationalize the various structures of the intestinal lining observed in vivo. Taking into account the coupling between cell division and local curvature, we obtain different patterns of villi and crypts, which could explain the different morphologies of the small intestine and the colon.","ads_id":"2011PhRvL.107g8104H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","arxiv_id":"1203.2080","authors":["E.
