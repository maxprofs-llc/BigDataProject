Here, we show that JNK also regulates retrograde axonal degeneration (axonal dieback) after spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. Activated phospho-JNK was highly expressed in damaged corticospinal tract (CST) axons after thoracic SCI by hemisection. Local administration of SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, prevented accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein and retraction of the severed CST axons as well as preserved the axonal arbors rostral to the injury site. The treatment with SP600125 also improved functional recovery of the hindlimbs, assessed by Basso mouse scale open-field scores and the grid-walking test. In Jnk1(-\/-) and Jnk3(-\/-) mice, we observed prevention of axonal degeneration and enhancement of motor recovery after SCI. These results indicate that both JNK1 and JNK3 induce axonal degeneration and limit motor recovery after SCI. Thus, a JNK inhibitor may be a suitable therapeutic agent for SCI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ad","doi":"10.1016\/j.neures.2011.07.183","first_seen_on":"2011-08-21T10:56:15+00:00","issns":["01680102"],"journal":"Neuroscience Research","last_mentioned_on":1313924100,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S016801021100366X&_version=1&md5=c647ece032906be181cca52c48552350&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"21824499","pubdate":"2011-08-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Approach to neural circuit mechanism underlying natural learned behavior","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cjun-nterminal-kinase-induces-axonal-degeneration-limits-motor-recovery-after-spinal-cord-injury-mic-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4964825,"mean":5.8812877342728,"rank":2051683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2829848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4964825,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62931,"mean":5.2638122993802,"rank":21681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":39267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62931,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":380,"mean":2.0399894459103,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":380,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.925,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
