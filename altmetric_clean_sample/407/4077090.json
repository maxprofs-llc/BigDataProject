The length of stay was correlated with the time from admission to contact with the service (the referral lag (REFLAG)), and the REFLAG's proportion of length of stay (REFLAG\/LOS) for all 140 in-patients, those with stays greater than 4 days, and for those under and over 65 years. Results The length of stay was significantly correlated with referral lag and logREFLAG\/logLOS for all patients and for patients with stays greater than 4 days. The correlations remained significant for both age groups, but were stronger in the younger group. Clinical implications Timeliness of contact with CLP was associated with shorter length of stay, particularly in younger patients. Psychiatric factors influencing length of stay in older patients should be studied by CLP services.","altmetric_jid":"54f5cd902a83eeb30f8b4569","authors":["Rebecca Wood","Anne P. F. Wand","Glenn E.
