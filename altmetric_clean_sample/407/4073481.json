Reported series typically include patients with associated cardiac anomalies.\nTo characterise the prevalence, age of onset, and the progress of dilatation of the ascending aorta in Turner's syndrome patients free of structural cardiac anomalies. Potential risk factors such as karyotype and growth hormone therapy were analysed for correlation with aortic dilatation.\nWe carried out a retrospective study with data collected from medical records and echocardiography studies. Patients with Tuner's syndrome followed-up between 1992 and 2010 with at least two echocardiography studies were eligible. Patients with previous cardiac surgery or under anti-hypertensive medication were excluded. Ascending aorta diameter measurements were adjusted for body surface area, and dilatation was defined as Z-score>2.\nThe study population consisted of 44 patients, aged 11.9\u00b17.4 years at the first echocardiogram and 17.9\u00b17.3 years at the last follow-up, with a follow-up duration of 6.0\u00b13.7 years. A total of 13 (29.5%) patients exhibited aortic dilatation during follow-up, suggesting an actuarial estimate of the freedom from aortic dilatation dropping from 86 to 70% and then to 37% at 10, 20, and 30 years of age, respectively. There was no statistically significant impact of karyotype or growth hormone therapy on aortic Z-score progression.\nThe prevalence of dilatation of the ascending aorta in Turner's syndrome patients free of structural aortic anomalies is comparable with published data with associated lesions. Growth hormone therapy and karyotype had no significant impact; however, longitudinal follow-up is warranted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024aa","authors":["Alami Laroussi, Nassiba","Dahdah, Nagib","Dallaire, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","Th\u00e9rien, Johanne","Fournier, Anne"],"doi":"10.1017\/s1047951115000682","first_seen_on":"2015-05-30T10:07:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1467-1107"],"journal":"Cardiology in the Young","last_mentioned_on":1432980425,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26022730?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26022730","pubdate":"2015-05-30T22:01:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","cardiology"],"title":"Aortic dilatation in patients with Turner's syndrome without structural cardiac anomaly.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aortic-dilatation-patients-turners-syndrome-without-structural-cardiac-anomaly"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5165287,"mean":6.1000543230349,"rank":4294617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5165287,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172831,"mean":8.8392004744548,"rank":141913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172831,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":542,"mean":0.84417005545286,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":542,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.4878823529412,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
