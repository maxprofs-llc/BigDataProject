For patients with asthma there are many instruments but most of them have been developed in English. With the increase in research project, researchers working in other languages have two options; either to develop a new measure or to translate an already developed measure. Children Health Survey for Asthma is developed by American Academy of Paediatrics which has two versions one for the parents (CHSA) and the other for the child (CHSA-C). However, there is no Malay version of the CHSA or the CHSA-C.\nThe aim of this study was to translate and determine the validity and reliability of the Malaysian versions of Parent and Children Health Survey for Asthma.\nQuestionnaires were translated to Bahasa Malayu using previously established guidelines, data from 180 respondents (asthmatic children and their parent) were analysed using Rasch-Model; as, it is an approach that has been increasingly used in health field and also it explores the performance of each item rather than total set score.\nThe internal consistency was high for the parent questionnaire (CHSA) (reliability score for persons = 0.88 and for items was 0.97), and good for child questionnaire (CHSA-C) (reliability score for persons = 0.83 and for items was 0.94). Also, this study shows that all items measure for both questionnaires (CHSA and CHSA-C) are fitted to Rasch-Model.\nThis study produced questionnaires that are conceptually equivalent to the original, easy to understand for the children and their parents, and good in terms of internal consistency. Because of the questionnaire has two versions one for the child and the other for the parents, they could be used in clinical practice to measure the effect of asthma on the child and their families. This current research had translated two instruments to other language (BahasaMalayu) and evaluated their reliability and validity hence will help researchers from the same country to use these translated instruments in their studies.","authors":["Hussein, Maryam Se","Akram, Waqas","Mamat, Mohd Nor","Majeed, Abu Bakar Abdul","Ismail, Nahlah Elkudssiah Binti"],"doi":"10.7860\/jcdr\/2015\/11995.5801","first_seen_on":"2015-05-30T10:15:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2249-782X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR","last_mentioned_on":1432988108,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26023580?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26023580?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26023580","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Validation of the malaysian versions of parents and children health survey for asthma by using rasch-model.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/validation-malaysian-versions-parents-children-health-survey-asthma-using-raschmodel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
