To better define the roles of this system, genome-wide transcriptional profiling was performed to identify the NtrC regulon during the response to nitrogen limitation. Upon perception of low intracellular nitrogen, phosphorylation of NtrC stimulates induction of genes responsible for alteration of the core glutamine synthetase\/glutamate synthase nitrogen assimilation pathway, including the glutamine synthetases and PII proteins. In addition, genes responsible for the import and utilization of multiple nitrogen sources, specifically nitrate and nitrite, were up-regulated by NtrC activation. Mutational analysis of a candidate nitrite reductase revealed a role for NtrC in regulating assimilation of nitrite since mutations in both ntrC and the gene encoding the candidate nitrite reductase abolished the ability to grow on nitrite as a sole nitrogen source.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["William L.
