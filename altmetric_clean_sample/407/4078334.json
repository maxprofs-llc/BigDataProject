(Y. Yamaguchi)"],"citation":{"abstract":"ZG16p is a soluble mammalian lectin that interacts with mannose and heparan sulfate. Here we describe detailed analyses of the interactions of human ZG16p with mycobacterial phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), using glycan microarray and NMR. Pathogen-related glycan microarray analysis identified phosphatidylinositol mono- and di-mannosides (PIM1 and PIM2) as novel ligand candidates of ZG16p. Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR and transferred NOE experiments with chemically synthesized PIM glycans indicate that PIMs preferentially interacts with ZG16p using the mannose residues. Binding site of PIMs is identified by chemical shift perturbation experiments using uniformly 15N-labeled ZG16p. NMR results with docking simulations suggest a binding mode of ZG16p and PIM glycan, which would help to consider the physiological role of ZG16p.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd9","authors":["Hanashima, Shinya","G\u00f6tze, Sebastian","Liu, Yan","Ikeda, Akemi","Kojima-Aikawa, Kyoko","Taniguchi, Naoyuki","Silva, Daniel Var\u00f3n","Feizi, Ten","Seeberger, Peter H.","Yamaguchi, Yoshiki","Kojima\u2010Aikawa, Kyoko","Var\u00f3n Silva, Daniel"],"doi":"10.1002\/cbic.201500103","endpage":"1511","first_seen_on":"2015-06-01T16:09:59+00:00","funders":["wellcome"],"issns":["1439-7633"],"issue":"10","journal":"ChemBioChem","last_mentioned_on":1434067303,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cbic.201500103","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201500103\/abstract;jsessionid=15261F63CAA6F016F463321C254A5DA6.f02t03","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cbic.201500103?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201500103\/pdf","pmid":"25919894","pubdate":"2015-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1502","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Defining the Interaction of Human Soluble Lectin ZG16p and Mycobacterial Phosphatidylinositol Mannosides","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/defining-interaction-human-soluble-lectin-zg16p-mycobacterial-phosphatidylinositol-mannosides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6375759,"mean":5.9877677907471,"rank":782932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":5590337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6375759,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179665,"mean":8.9101825852703,"rank":33073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":146449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179665,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1563,"mean":2.2240089628681,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":1506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1563,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":1.3186046511628,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
