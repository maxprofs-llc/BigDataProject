In our previous studies, Rg3 inhibited phorbol ester-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression and NF-\u03baB activation in cultured human mammary epithelial (MCF-10A) cells and in mouse skin in vivo. In this study, we investigated Rg3-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells and underlying molecular mechanisms.\nAfter Rg3 treatment, apoptotic cell death of MDA-MB-231 cell was investigated by the MTT reduction assay and measurement of the mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis and detection of apoptotic cells as well as measurement of reactive oxygen species. Expression of apoptotic-related proteins was determined by immunoblot analysis.\nMDA-MB-231 cells treated with Rg3 (30\u03bcM) exhibited the increased proportion of hypodiploid or apoptotic cells. Rg3 treatment resulted in an increase in the ratio of proapoptotic Bax to antiapoptotic Bcl-2, depolarization of the mitochondria membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Rg3 also induced the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, which was attenuated by a caspase-3 inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk.\nBased on these findings, it is likely that Rg3 induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells via classical mitochondria-dependent caspase activation. These data suggest that Rg3 might be a potential candidate as a breast cancer chemopreventive agent.","authors":["Bo-Min Kim","Do-Hee Kim","Jeong-Hill Park","Hye-Kyung Na","Young-Joon Surh"],"doi":"10.15430\/jcp.2013.18.2.177","first_seen_on":"2015-05-29T11:49:40+00:00","issns":["2288-3649"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Cancer Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1432900171,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4189457\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4189457","pmid":"25337544","pubdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Korean Society of Cancer Prevention","startpage":"177","title":"Ginsenoside Rg3 Induces Apoptosis of Human Breast Cancer (MDA-MB-231) Cells","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ginsenoside-rg3-induces-apoptosis-human-breast-cancer-mdamb231-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
