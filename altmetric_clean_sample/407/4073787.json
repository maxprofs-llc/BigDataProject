LPS is recognized by the toll-like receptor 4 and myeloid differentiation factor 2 complex of mammalian immune cells and leads to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is a vital step to remove LPS from the proteins before use for therapeutic purpose. In this study, we constructed BL21 (DE3) \u2206msbB28 \u2206pagP38 mutant, which produces a penta-acylated LPS with reduced endotoxicity. The plasmids harboring pagL and\/or lpxE were then introduced into this mutant to further modify the LPS. The new strain (S004) carrying plasmid pQK004 (pagL and lpxE) produced mono-phosphoryated tetra-acylated lipid A, which induces markedly less production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 in the RAW264.7 and IL-12 in the THP1, but still retains ability to produce recombinant proteins. This study provides a strategy to decrease endotoxic activity of recombinant proteins purified from E. coli BL21 backgrounds and a feasible approach to modify lipid A structure for alternative purposes such as mono-phosphoryl lipid A (MPL) as vaccine adjuvants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Liu, Qiong","Li, Yanyan","Zhao, Xinxin","Yang, Xue","Liu, Qing","Kong, Qingke"],"doi":"10.3390\/md13063388","first_seen_on":"2015-05-30T10:37:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"6","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1432982224,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26023843?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26023843","pubdate":"2015-05-30T22:00:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"Construction of Escherichia coli Mutant with Decreased Endotoxic Activity by Modifying Lipid A Structure.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/construction-escherichia-coli-mutant-decreased-endotoxic-activity-modifying-lipid-structure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5165050,"mean":6.1002610805847,"rank":4294601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5165050,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172830,"mean":8.8394298294848,"rank":141921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172830,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":691,"mean":3.1406115942029,"rank":603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":691,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.1551282051282,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
