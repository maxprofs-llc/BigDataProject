We included demographic variables, urinary incontinence, polypharmacy, sleep disorder, nutritional status, depression and autonomy. The two latter were assessed using the Yesavage geriatric depression scale and the Katz index. We used descriptive statistics.\nThe total number of patients was 376; 219 (58%) were females and 157 (42%) were males; mean age was 72.57 years (65-95 +\/- 7.08), and 98.7% had at least one geriatric syndrome. Depression was detected in 303 (80.9%), 282 (75%) were on polypharmacy, 262 (69.7%) had sleep disorders, 63 (16.8%) had experienced falls, 19 (5.1%) had urinary incontinence, 15 (4%) were obese, and 3 (0.8%) had loss of autonomy.\n98.7% of the patients had at least one geriatric syndrome; females were the most affected sex; depression was the most frequent syndrome, followed by polypharmacy, sleep disorders, falls, urinary incontinence, obesity and loss of autonomy.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e12a83eeb12a8b4918","authors":["Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez, A M","V\u00e1zquez-Cruz, E","Romero-Medina, J L","Guti\u00e9rrez-Gabriel, I","Montiel-Jarqu\u00edn, A J","Salvatori, J","Rub\u00ed, J J","Garc\u00eda, Carrasco M","Mendoza-Pinto, C"],"first_seen_on":"2015-05-30T10:07:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2306-4102"],"issue":"5","journal":"Acta ortop\u00e9dica mexicana","last_mentioned_on":1432980429,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26021092?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26021092","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"[Geriatric syndromes in patients with a non-recent hip fracture seen at a primary health care unit].","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geriatric-syndromes-patients-nonrecent-hip-fracture-seen-primary-health-care-unit-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5165331,"mean":6.0999753905388,"rank":4294624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5165331,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172832,"mean":8.8391493308493,"rank":141913,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172832,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.675,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.5,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/status\/604589858191900674","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4073477],"posted_on":"2015-05-30T10:07:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":159},"tweet_id":"604589858191900674"}]}}
