The clinical probability of PE was assessed using Wells and revised Geneva scores.\nClinical examination, D-dimer test, and multidetector computed angiotomography were performed in all participants. The accuracy of the scores was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analyses.\nPE was confirmed in 46 participants (23%) (24 training group, 22 validation group). In the training group, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.85-0.98) for the Wells score and 0.69 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.56-0.82) for the revised Geneva score (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). These results were confirmed in the validation group (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The positive (LR+) and negative likelihood ratios (LR-) (two indices combining sensitivity and specificity) of the Wells score were superior to those of the revised Geneva score in the training (LR+, 7.90 vs 1.34; LR-, 0.23 vs 0.66) and validation (LR+, 13.5 vs 1.46; LR-, 0.47 vs 0.54) groups.\nIn high-risk elderly hospitalized adults, the Wells score is more accurate than the revised Geneva score for diagnosing PE.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5a","authors":["Di Marca, Salvatore","Cilia, Chiara","Campagna, Andrea","D'Arrigo, Graziella","ElHafeez, Samar Abd","Tripepi, Giovanni","Puccia, Giuseppe","Pisano, Marcella","Mastrosimone, Gianluca","Terranova, Valentina","Cardella, Antonella","Buonacera, Agata","Stancanelli, Benedetta","Zoccali, Carmine","Malatino, Lorenzo"],"doi":"10.1111\/jgs.13459","endpage":"1097","first_seen_on":"2015-06-01T20:42:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1532-5415"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","last_mentioned_on":1433199035,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.13459\/abstract;jsessionid=06C35F3AEAD718FD667C75D537C49833.f04t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.13459\/pdf","pmid":"26032745","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1091","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Comparison of Wells and Revised Geneva Rule to Assess Pretest Probability of Pulmonary Embolism in High\u2010Risk Hospitalized Elderly Adults","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-wells-revised-geneva-rule-assess-pretest-probability-pulmonary-embolism-highrisk-hospital"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6373325,"mean":5.9858376304108,"rank":3005132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1904539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6373325,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178664,"mean":8.9314775415168,"rank":99046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":61827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178664,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1968,"mean":10.013567869853,"rank":1286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1968,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":7.0360470588235,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
