This interaction must be able to withstand the mechanical strain that the M-band typically experiences and remain intact. The mechanical force on these domains is likely exerted along one of two axes: a longitudinal axis, resulting in a 'shearing' force, or a lateral axis, resulting in a 'peeling' force. Here we present molecular dynamics data suggesting that these forces result in distinct unraveling pathways of the titin\/obscurin complex and that peeling the domains apart requires less work and force.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["Caldwell, Tracy A","Sumner, Isaiah","Wright, Nathan T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.febslet.2015.05.023","first_seen_on":"2015-05-29T17:05:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-3468","0014-5793"],"journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1432946279,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0014579315003993"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.febsletters.org\/article\/S0014579315003993\/pdf","pmid":"26001486","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Mechanical dissociation of the M-band titin\/obscurin complex is directionally dependent","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanical-dissociation-mband-titinobscurin-complex-directionally-dependent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5165331,"mean":6.0999753905388,"rank":1935961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3209282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5165331,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173007,"mean":8.8385382934697,"rank":62224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":110014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173007,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3584,"mean":2.7848250069774,"rank":2569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3584,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":2.0491666666667,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
