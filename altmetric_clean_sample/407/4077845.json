Data were drawn from a large UK cohort study (n = 516 with up to five observations) spanning the full range of disease severity.\nLinear regression was systematically biased. Three- and four-component mixture models and generalized probit models exhibit no such bias and improved fit to the data. The mean, median, mean error, and mean absolute error favored the mixture model approach. Root mean square error favored the generalized ordered probit model approach for the data as a whole. Model fit assessed using these same measures by disease severity quartiles tended to be best using the mixture models. The value of moving from good to poor health may differ substantially according to the chosen method. Simulated data from the mixture and probit models yield a very similar distribution to the original data set.\nThese results add to a body of evidence that the statistical model used to estimate health utilities matters. Linear models are not appropriate. The four-class bespoke mixture model approach provides the best performing method to estimate the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire values from BASDAI and BASFI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ec","authors":["Wailoo, Allan","Hern\u00e1ndez, Monica","Philips, Ceri","Brophy, Sinead","Siebert, Stefan","Allan Wailoo","Monica Hern\u00e1ndez","Ceri Philips","Sinead Brophy","Stefan Siebert"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jval.2015.02.016","endpage":"431","first_seen_on":"2015-06-01T13:22:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-3015","1524-4733","10983015"],"issue":"4","journal":"Value in Health (Elsevier Science)","last_mentioned_on":1488240000,"links":["http:\/\/www.valueinhealthjournal.com\/article\/S1098-3015(15)01853-7\/abstract?_returnURL=http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1098301515018537%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&cc=y=","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1098301515018537&_version=1&md5=6acf81b1643dd347d0ac9739da55500f","http:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/a\/1RCut3vkO-gB4f","http:\/\/www.valueinhealthjournal.com\/article\/S1098-3015(15)02658-3\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.valueinhealthjournal.com\/article\/S1098-3015(15)02655-8\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jval.2015.02.016","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.valueinhealthjournal.com%2Farticle%2FS1098-3015%252815%252901853-7%2Fabstract%3F_returnURL%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%252Fretrieve%252Fpii%252FS1098301515018537%253Fshowall%253Dtrue%26cc%3Dy%253D&code=jval-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.valueinhealthjournal.com\/article\/S1098301515018537\/pdf","pmid":"26091596","pubdate":"2015-06-21T22:12:09+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"425","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Disease Burden, Outcomes and Costs Among Adults Admitted To Hospital In The United Kingdom (Uk) Due to Plaque Or Erythrodermic Psoriasis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1098301515018537","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modeling-health-state-utility-values-ankylosing-spondylitis-comparisons-direct-indirect-methods"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.2,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":941826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7339447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222370,"mean":8.5848031605126,"rank":35039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":187270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222370,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1695,"mean":3.8762479338843,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1695,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":6.971875,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
