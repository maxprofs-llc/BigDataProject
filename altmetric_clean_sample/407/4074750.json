However, the temporal and regional specificity of such changes and their behavioural consequences are less known. Here we explore the integrity of regional white matter microstructure in infants with in utero exposure to alcohol, shortly after birth.\nTwenty-eight alcohol-exposed and 28 healthy unexposed infants were imaged using diffusion tensor imaging sequences to evaluate white matter integrity using validated tract-based spatial statistics analysis methods. Second, diffusion values were extracted for group comparisons by regions of interest. Differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity were compared between groups and associations with measures from the Dubowitz neonatal neurobehavioural assessment were examined.\nLower AD values (p<0.05) were observed in alcohol-exposed infants in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus compared with non-exposed infants. Altered FA and MD values in alcohol-exposed neonates in the right inferior cerebellar were associated with abnormal neonatal neurobehaviour.\nThese exploratory data suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with reduced white matter microstructural integrity even early in the neonatal period. The association with clinical measures reinforces the likely clinical significance of this finding. The location of the findings is remarkably consistent with previously reported studies of white matter structural deficits in older children with a diagnosis of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215a","authors":["Donald, Kirsten Ann","Roos, Annerine","Fouche, Jean-Paul","Koen, Nastassja","Howells, Fleur M","Woods, Roger P","Zar, Heather J","Narr, Katherine L","Stein, Dan J","Kirsten Ann\u00a0Donald","Annerine\u00a0Roos","Jean-Paul\u00a0Fouche","Nastassja\u00a0Koen","Fleur M.\u00a0Howells","Roger P.\u00a0Woods","Heather J.\u00a0Zar","Katherine L.\u00a0Narr","Dan J.\u00a0Stein"],"doi":"10.1017\/neu.2015.35","first_seen_on":"2015-05-30T22:57:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1601-5215"],"issue":"04","journal":"Acta Neuropsychiatrica","last_mentioned_on":1435929067,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26022619?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?aid=9806359&fromPage=online","http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9806359&utm_source=Issue_Alert&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=NEU"],"pmid":"26022619","pubdate":"2015-05-31T22:02:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"A study of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on white matter microstructural integrity at birth","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-effects-prenatal-alcohol-exposure-white-matter-microstructural-integrity-birth-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5310151,"mean":6.2304813246328,"rank":2450605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2726650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5310151,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175295,"mean":8.9020949946948,"rank":83084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":86151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175295,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276,"mean":1.9114545454545,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.7647058823529,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
