To examine how environmental conditions affect lesion healing, we assessed several water quality parameters and tissue regeneration rates in corals at six reefs around St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. We hypothesized that sites closer to developed areas would have poor water quality due to proximity to anthropogenic stresses, which would impede tissue regeneration. We found that water flow and turbidity most strongly influenced lesion recovery rates. The most impacted site, with high turbidity and low flow, recovered almost three times slower than the least impacted site, with low turbidity, high flow, and low levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Our results illustrate that in addition to lesion-specific factors known to affect tissue regeneration, environmental conditions can also control corals' healing rates. Resource managers can use this information to protect low-flow, turbid nearshore reefs by minimizing sources of anthropogenic stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006690","authors":["Sabine, Alexis M","Smith, Tyler B","Williams, Dana E","Brandt, Marilyn E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.marpolbul.2015.04.006","first_seen_on":"2015-06-01T13:39:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-3363","0025326X"],"journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1433165888,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0025326X15001940"],"pmid":"25982415","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Earth and Planetary Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Environmental conditions influence tissue regeneration rates in scleractinian corals ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/environmental-conditions-influence-tissue-regeneration-rates-scleractinian-corals-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5174102,"mean":6.1057314111209,"rank":3633982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":871906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5174102,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174951,"mean":8.8276272420693,"rank":124395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":31472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174951,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1713,"mean":5.0424731308411,"rank":1015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1713,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":6.7793888888889,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
