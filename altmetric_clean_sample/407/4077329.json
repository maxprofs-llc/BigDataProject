Pathogenic bacterial provocateurs like adherent and invasive E. coli have been reported to increase susceptibility to Crohn's disease. Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin\/protein isolate (SBI) is comprised primarily of immunoglobulins (Igs) that bind to conserved microbial components and neutralize exotoxins.\nTo demonstrate that oral administration of SBI may modulate mucosal inflammation following colonization with E. coli, LF82, and exposure to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS).\nDefined microbiota mice harboring the altered Schaedler flora (ASF) were administered SBI or hydrolyzed collagen twice daily starting 7\u00a0days prior to challenge with E. coli LF82 and continuing for the remainder of the experiment. Mice were treated with DSS for 7\u00a0days and then evaluated for evidence of local and peripheral inflammation.\nIgs within SBI bound multiple antigens from all eight members of the ASF and E. coli LF82 by western blot analysis. Multiple parameters of LF82\/DSS-induced colitis were reduced following administration of SBI, including histological lesion scores, secretion of cytokines and chemokines from cecal biopsies, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and serum amyloid A from plasma.\nOral administration of SBI attenuated clinical signs of LF82\/DSS-induced colitis in mice. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that SBI immunoglobulin binding of bacterial antigens in the intestinal lumen may inhibit the inflammatory cascades that contribute to IBD, thus attenuating DSS-induced colitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002709","authors":["Henderson, Abigail L","Brand, Meghan Wymore","Darling, Ross J","Maas, Kenneth J","Detzel, Christopher J","Hostetter, Jesse","Wannemuehler, Michael J","Weaver, Eric M"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10620-015-3726-5","first_seen_on":"2015-06-01T10:08:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-2568"],"journal":"Digestive Diseases & Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1454501226,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26026602?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26026602","pubdate":"2015-06-01T22:00:41+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Transplant Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Attenuation of Colitis by Serum-Derived Bovine Immunoglobulin\/Protein Isolate in a Defined Microbiota Mouse Model.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attenuation-colitis-serumderived-bovine-immunoglobulinprotein-isolate-defined-microbiota-mouse-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7089314,"mean":6.2945947100909,"rank":1425786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5618361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7089314,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215259,"mean":8.2382662944003,"rank":55722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":158861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215259,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1371,"mean":3.318703649635,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1371,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":0.86538461538462,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
