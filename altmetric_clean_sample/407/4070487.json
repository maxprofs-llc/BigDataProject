In this study, resistance levels to geneticin (G418) of 14 F. graminearum and 24 F. culmorum isolates collected from cereals were determined. Fungal cultures were grown on potato dextrose agar medium supplemented with 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 \u00b5g\/mL of G418. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined as 25 \u00b5g\/mL. As a result, it was concluded that all isolates were highly sensitive to G418. Plasmid pFA6-kanmx4 containing geneticin resistance gene (kanmx) was introduced singly or co-electroporated with pEGFP75 plasmid, containing GFP gene, into fungal protoplast cultures obtained with lytic enzyme. Transformants were grown in media including 25 \u00b5g\/mL G418. Transformation frequencies were 2.8 and 1.8 transformant per \u00b5g plasmid for F. graminearum and F. culmorum isolates, respectively. Transformation process was also confirmed by spectrofluorimetric assay. Relative fluorescence unit values in co-transformants were calculated as 1.87 \u00b1 0.04 for F. graminearum and 2.26 \u00b1 0.08 for F. culmorum. The results obtained from the study gave information about antibiotic resistance levels of two Fusarium species in Turkey. Moreover, it was shown that pFA6-kanmx4 plasmid was a suitable vector, which can be used in genetic manipulation studies of these two fungal species in particular suppression of endogenous and\/or the expression of exogenous genes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006ca2","authors":["Y\u00f6r\u00fck, Emre","Albayrak, G\u00fclruh"],"doi":"10.1080\/13102818.2014.996978","first_seen_on":"2015-05-29T10:21:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1310-2818"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biotechnology & Biotechnological Equipment","last_mentioned_on":1432894774,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26019640?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26019640","pubdate":"2015-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Geneticin (G418) resistance and electroporation-mediated transformation of Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geneticin-g418-resistance-electroporationmediated-transformation-fusarium-graminearum-f-culmorum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5163187,"mean":6.0993483949663,"rank":4293017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5163187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172966,"mean":8.8393896221781,"rank":142080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172966,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":1.3458850574713,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.1166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
