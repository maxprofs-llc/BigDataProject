This study explored this clinical stratification process through the use of semi-structured interviews with senior occupational therapists (n = 17) and stroke physicians (n = 7) using qualitative description methodology. The findings revealed a trichotomy stratification of stroke patients for driving in the clinical setting; those who are fit to drive, unfit to drive, and a \"maybe\" group who need more detailed assessment and observation. Factors that had a major influence on this clinical-based stratification of driving suitability were client's levels of awareness, insight, and impulsivity. A period of prolonged contact with the client was preferential to guide the stratification decision in order for clinicians to build a comprehensive picture of the person. A mix of assessment approaches including standardized assessment but with increased emphasis on naturalistic observation of functional performance underpinned the clinical stratification process. This study uncovers some of the factors and processes influencing the early clinical-based stratification of driving suitability after stroke, and highlights the contribution of the generalist practitioner in the assessment of fitness to drive continuum.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f6100042c9","authors":["Stapleton, Tadhg","Connolly, Deirdre","O'Neill, Desmond"],"doi":"10.3109\/07380577.2015.1036192","first_seen_on":"2015-05-29T09:52:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1541-3098","0738-0577"],"issue":"3","journal":"Occupational Therapy in Health Care","last_mentioned_on":1459286550,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26020451","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26020451?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26020451","pubdate":"2015-05-29T22:00:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"title":"Factors Influencing the Clinical Stratification of Suitability to Drive after Stroke: A Qualitative Study.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factors-influencing-clinical-stratification-suitability-drive-after-stroke-qualitative-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7458268,"mean":6.4789686129458,"rank":5381959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1814259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7458268,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215138,"mean":8.3178146390441,"rank":138602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":63751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215138,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":2.8122807017544,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":5.45,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
