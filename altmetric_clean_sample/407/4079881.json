AVT was positive in 12 (41.4%) cases and negative in 17 (58.6%) cases. Demographical variables, cardiopulmonary indicators, and laboratory findings were compared in these two subgroups.\nThe mean age was 62.3\u00b17.8 years for AVT negative group, while it was 64.8\u00b17.3 years in AVT positive group (P=0.38). Except for the changes in systolic, diastolic, and mean pulmonary arterial pressures before and after iloprost administration, there were no statistically significant differences regarding any of the parameters under investigation in both groups.\nDespite the high rate of positivity for AVT in severe pulmonary hypertension patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, none of the variables under investigation displayed a noteworthy difference between AVT negative and positive groups. Identification of factors likely to influence AVT results is important for establishment of appropriate treatment protocols especially for AVT negative cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f61000784b","authors":["Selvi Asker","Muntecep Asker"],"doi":"10.2147\/copd.s82856","first_seen_on":"2015-06-02T01:54:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2005"],"journal":"International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","last_mentioned_on":1433210018,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/acute-vasoreactivity-test-results-in-severe-pulmonary-hypertension-pat-peer-reviewed-article-COPD"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=25267","pmid":"26064044","pubdate":"2015-06-13T22:11:14+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Acute vasoreactivity test results in severe pulmonary hypertension patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: our experience with 29 cases","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-vasoreactivity-test-results-severe-pulmonary-hypertension-patients-chronic-obstructive-pulmona-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5180234,"mean":6.1097096327546,"rank":3639024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":872085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5180234,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174945,"mean":8.8246587593746,"rank":124347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174945,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":631,"mean":3.3621396825397,"rank":447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":631,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":2.25,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
