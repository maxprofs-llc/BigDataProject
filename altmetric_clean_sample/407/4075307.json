In this study, we demonstrate that miR-150 and miR-223 specifically target the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) 3' untranslated region, reducing STAT1 expression and dampening STAT1-dependent signaling in human T cells. The effects of miR-150 and miR-223 on endogenous STAT1 were confirmed using inducible cell lines. Our studies also showed that miR-150 expression is upregulated by interleukin-2 signaling in adult T cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATL) cells. HTLV-I-transformed and ATL-derived cells have reduced levels of miR150 and miR223 expression, which coincide with increased STAT1 expression and STAT1-dependent signaling. Knockdown of STAT1 by short hairpin RNA demonstrated that the constitutive activation of STAT1 is required for the continuous proliferation of HTLV-I-transformed cells. Our studies further demonstrate that increased expression of STAT1 in ATL cells is associated with higher levels of major histocompatibility complex class I expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that the pressure exerted by natural killer (NK) cells in vivo can edit leukemic tumor cells by forcing an increased expression of major histocompatibility complex class I to escape immune clearance. STAT1-expressing tumor cells produce more aggressive tumors because they cannot be eliminated by NK cells. Our results suggest that therapeutic approaches using combined targeting of STAT1 and MHC class I may be an effective approach to activate NK cell-mediated clearance of ATL tumor cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000317c","authors":["Moles, Ramona","Bellon, Marcia","Nicot, Christophe"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neo.2015.04.005","endpage":"462","first_seen_on":"2015-05-31T10:10:39+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1476-5586","14765586"],"issue":"5","journal":"Neoplasia","last_mentioned_on":1455948173,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26025667?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26025667?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26025667?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26025667","pubdate":"2015-05-31T22:00:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"449","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"STAT1: A Novel Target of miR-150 and miR-223 Is Involved in the Proliferation of HTLV-I-Transformed and ATL Cells.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stat1-novel-target-mir150-mir223-involved-proliferation-htlvitransformed-atl-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7216446,"mean":6.3565472342651,"rank":1465105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5704250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7216446,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215167,"mean":8.267473299685,"rank":55952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":158524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215167,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":329,"mean":2.5434451219512,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":329,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.95,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
