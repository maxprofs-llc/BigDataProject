Given the persistence of the addiction phenotype at both behavioral and transcriptional levels, several studies have been conducted to elucidate the epigenetic landscape associated with persistent effects of drug use on the mammalian brain. This review discusses recent advances in our comprehension of epigenetic mechanisms underlying amphetamine- or methamphetamine-induced behavioral, transcriptional, and synaptic plasticity. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that drug exposure induces major epigenetic modifications-histone acetylation and methylation, DNA methylation-in a very complex manner. In rare instances, however, the regulation of a specific target gene can be correlated to both epigenetic alterations and behavioral abnormalities. Work is now needed to clarify and validate an epigenetic model of addiction to amphetamines. Investigations that include genome-wide approaches will accelerate the speed of discovery in the field of addiction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f6100072c8","authors":["Godino, Arthur","Jayanthi, Subramaniam","Cadet, Jean Lud","Arthur Godino","Subramaniam Jayanthi","Jean Lud Cadet"],"doi":"10.1080\/15592294.2015.1055441","first_seen_on":"2015-05-30T10:12:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-2308","1559-2294"],"journal":"Epigenetics","last_mentioned_on":1500768235,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26023847?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26023847?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26023847","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/15592294.2015.1055441","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/15592294.2015.1055441#abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26023847","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/15592294.2015.1055441?utm_content=bufferf269e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"26023847","pubdate":"2015-05-30T22:00:29+00:00","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Epigenetic landscape of amphetamine and methamphetamine addiction in rodents","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-landscape-amphetamine-methamphetamine-addiction-rodents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":734481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7520471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220090,"mean":8.5815982806956,"rank":27080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":192726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220090,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":683,"mean":4.5971700879765,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":683,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":4.6223076923077,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
