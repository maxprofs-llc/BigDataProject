Biokinetics of 150 MBq (68)Ga-DOTATATE-PET was simulated with different noise levels [fractional standard deviation (FSD) 10%, 1%, 0.1%, and 0.01%], and seven combinations of measurements at 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h p.i. PBPK model parameters were fitted to the simulated noisy PET data using population-based Bayesian parameters to construct predicted MPPs. Therapy simulations were performed as 30 min infusion of (90)Y-DOTATATE of 3.3 GBq in both true and predicted MPPs. Prediction accuracy was then calculated as relative variability vorgan between TIACs from both MPPs.\nLarge variability values of one time-point protocols [e.g., FSD = 1%, 240 min p.i., vkidneys = (9 \u00b1 6)%, and vtumor = (27 \u00b1 26)%] show inaccurate prediction. Accurate TIAC prediction of the kidneys was obtained for the case of two measurements (1 and 4 h p.i.), e.g., FSD = 1%, vkidneys = (7 \u00b1 3)%, and vtumor = (22 \u00b1 10)%, or three measurements, e.g., FSD = 1%, vkidneys = (7 \u00b1 3)%, and vtumor = (22 \u00b1 9)%.\n(68)Ga-DOTATATE-PET measurements could possibly be used to predict the TIACs of (90)Y-DOTATATE when using a PBPK model and population-based Bayesian parameters. The two time-point measurement at 1 and 4 h p.i. with a noise up to FSD = 1% allows an accurate prediction of the TIACs in kidneys.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000309b","authors":["Deni Hardiansyah","Wei Guo","Peter Kletting","Felix M.
