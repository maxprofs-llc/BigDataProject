Currently, information about the incidence and indications for peripartum hysterectomy are not well defined in Australia.\nEvaluate the incidence and indications of peripartum hysterectomy in the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) between 2000 and 2014.\nA 15-year retrospective cohort study of peripartum hysterectomies at RBWH was conducted. The incidence of this event was calculated. Risk factors for abnormal placentation were explored using univariate analyses. Statistical significance was declared at \u03b1 < 0.05.\nA total of 83 cases of peripartum hysterectomy were reviewed. The incidence of peripartum hysterectomy was 0.60 per 1000 births after discounting the 44 (53%) cases of peripheral regional hospital referrals. Abnormal placentation and uterine atony constituted the majority of the indications for peripartum hysterectomy. Abnormal placentation included placenta praevia, accrete, increta and percreta. In this cohort with peripartum hysterectomy, previous caesarean section was strongly associated with abnormal placentation (P < 0.001, OR 11.4, 95% CI 3.6-35.8). No maternal mortality was recorded, although 63% of patients encountered complications. A planned peripartum hysterectomy resulted in significantly fewer red blood cell (P = 0.011) and platelet transfusions (P = 0.001).\nThe incidence of peripartum hysterectomy recorded in our tertiary institution between 2000 and 2014 is 0.60 per 1000 births. Abnormal placentation is the commonest indication leading to severe postpartum haemorrhage requiring peripartum hysterectomy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000235e","authors":["Cheng, Hon C","Pelecanos, Anita","Sekar, Renuka"],"doi":"10.1111\/ajo.12519","first_seen_on":"2016-08-19T10:41:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1479-828X"],"journal":"Australian & New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","last_mentioned_on":1471603245,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27535339?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27535339","pubdate":"2016-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Review of peripartum hysterectomy rates at a tertiary Australian hospital","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-peripartum-hysterectomy-rates-tertiary-australian-hospital"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":6258187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1114036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253918,"mean":12.265405601043,"rank":180690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253918,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":564,"mean":4.2904653641208,"rank":422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":564,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.9323529411765,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/QIMRBergh_pubs\/statuses\/766585690653986816","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10700635],"posted_on":"2016-08-19T10:40:45+00:00","author":{"name":"QIMRBerghofer papers","url":"http:\/\/www.qimrberghofer.edu.au\/page\/Our_Research\/Our_Publications","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000471327715\/1e96f035d50983f348b2c67af8d9352f_normal.jpeg","description":"Official feed of scientific publications by QIMR Berghofer researchers from PubMed - This is an automated feed.
