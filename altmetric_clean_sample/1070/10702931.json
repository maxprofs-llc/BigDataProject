This study aimed to determine the effect of mifepristone on E-cadherin expression in human villi in early pregnancy.\nForty healthy women seeking elective pregnancy termination at 5-7 weeks of gestation were recruited. Of these, 22 women chose medical termination (mifepristone-treated group) and took 25mg mifepristone every 12h for 3 days and 600\u03bcg buccal misoprostol on the morning of the fourth day. The other 18 women underwent vacuum aspiration (control group). Following collection of villi, E-cadherin protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis, and E-cadherin mRNA expression was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\nE-cadherin protein expression was significantly higher (p<0.05) in villous cytotrophoblast cells in the mifepristone-treated group compared with the control group. E-cadherin MRSA expression was also significantly higher (p<0.01) in the mifepristone-treated group compared with the control group.\nE-cadherin expression in villi may be involved in mifepristone-induced pregnancy termination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002845","authors":["Zheng, X","Sun, Y","Zhang, H","Zhao, X","Li, M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejogrb.2015.08.004","endpage":"118","first_seen_on":"2016-08-19T13:44:21+00:00","issns":["1872-7654","03012115"],"journal":"European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology & Reproductive Biology","last_mentioned_on":1471614244,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26363825"],"pmid":"26363825","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"115","subjects":["obstetrics","reproductivemedicine","gynecology"],"title":"Prospective study evaluating the effect of mifepristone on E-cadherin expression in villi in early pregnancy","type":"article","volume":"194","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospective-study-evaluating-effect-mifepristone-ecadherin-expression-villi-early-pregnancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":7133946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253919,"mean":12.265178695484,"rank":214329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253919,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1600,"mean":3.056909318324,"rank":1143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1600,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":2.0744680851064,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
