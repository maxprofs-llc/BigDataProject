Higher positivity rates were observed in diarrhoeic goats (6.5\u00a0%, 3\/46) than in asymptomatic animals (5.4\u00a0%, 5\/93), although the difference was not statistically significant. Based on the analysis of a portion of the 3D gene, four strains were found to share the highest nucleotide (nt) sequence identity with bovine kobuviruses (95.0-98.0\u00a0%), which had been detected previously in calves in the UK and Korea. Interestingly, two strains were genetically related to the newly discovered caprine kobuviruses (83.0-97.0\u00a0% nt sequence identity), which had been identified in black goats in Korea and in roe deer in Italy. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that kobuviruses are common enteric viruses of goats, although their clinical relevance remains to be investigated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000230f","authors":["Melegari, Irene","Di Profio, Federica","Sarchese, Vittorio","Martella, Vito","Marsilio, Fulvio","Di Martino, Barbara"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00705-016-3017-2","first_seen_on":"2016-08-19T14:21:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-8798","0304-8608"],"journal":"Archives of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1471662588,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27535411?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27535411","pubdate":"2016-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"First molecular evidence of kobuviruses in goats in Italy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/first-molecular-evidence-kobuviruses-goats-italy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":6260191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1114380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253934,"mean":12.265190124954,"rank":180657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253934,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1498,"mean":2.054796259185,"rank":895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1498,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":0.88103448275862,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/goat_papers\/statuses\/766641144058908672","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10703494],"posted_on":"2016-08-19T14:21:06+00:00","author":{"name":"goatpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558367908275822592\/MZjFXuZV_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"goat_papers","tweeter_id":"2992530750","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":51},"tweet_id":"766641144058908672"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bruno_peiffer\/statuses\/766834590308769793","license":"gnip","rt":["goat_papers"],"citation_ids":[10703494],"posted_on":"2016-08-20T03:09:48+00:00","author":{"name":"peiffer","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471917101393780738\/obG1XNh5_normal.jpeg","description":"News concernant l'alimentation, la sant\u00e9 animale, la sant\u00e9 des v\u00e9g\u00e9taux et l'environnement li\u00e9 \u00e0 tout ceci.","id_on_source":"bruno_peiffer","tweeter_id":"1600296992","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":969},"tweet_id":"766834590308769793"}]}}
