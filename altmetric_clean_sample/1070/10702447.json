However, the therapeutic efficacy of CAR T cells in solid tumors is yet to be achieved. In this study we systematically evaluated a series of CAR constructs targeting glypican-3 (GPC3), which is selectively expressed on several solid tumors. We compared GPC3-specific CARs that encoded CD3\u03b6 (Gz) alone, or with costimulatory domains derived from CD28 (G28z), 4-1BB (GBBz), or CD28 and 4-1BB (G28BBz). All GPC3-CARs rendered T cells highly cytotoxic to GPC3-positive hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatoblastoma and malignant rhabdoid tumor cell lines in vitro. GBBz induced the preferential production of Th-1 cytokines (IFN\uf067\/GM-CSF) while G28z preferentially induced Th-2 cytokines (IL-4\/IL-10). Inclusion of 4-1BB in G28BBz could only partially ameliorate the Th2-polarizing effect of CD28. 4-1BB induced superior expansion of CAR T cells in vitro and in vivo. T cells expressing GPC3-CARs incorporating CD28, 4-1BB or both induced sustained tumor regressions in two xenogeneic tumor models. Thus, GBBz CAR endows T cells with superior proliferative potential, potent antitumor activity and a Th1-biased cytokine profile justifying further clinical development of GBBz CAR for immunotherapy of GPC3-positive solid tumors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a0c","authors":["Li, Wenpeng","Guo, Linjie","Rathi, Purva","Marinova, Ekaterina","Gao, Xiuhua","Wu, Meng-Feng","Liu, Hao","Dotti, Gianpietro","Gottschalk, Stephen","Metelitsa, Leonid","Heczey, Andras"],"doi":"10.1089\/hum.2016.025","first_seen_on":"2016-08-19T13:09:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-7422","1043-0342"],"journal":"Human Gene Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1471625829,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27530312"],"pmid":"27530312","pubdate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Redirecting T cells to Glypican-3 with 4-1BB.\u03b6 CAR results in Th-1 polarization and potent anti-tumor activity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/redirecting-t-cells-glypican3-41bb-zeta-chimeric-antigen-receptors-results-th1-polarization-potent-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":3897813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4166631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253918,"mean":12.265132480298,"rank":117839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":127892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253918,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":481,"mean":10.240191666667,"rank":245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":481,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":17.282692307692,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
