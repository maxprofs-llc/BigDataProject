The aim of this study was to experimentally validate high mobility group AT-hook 1 as a novel target for miR-214-mediated suppression of growth and motility.\nHMGA1 and miR-214 expression levels were estimated in cervical and colorectal clinical specimens using qPCR. HMGA1 3' untranslated region luciferase assays were performed to validate HMGA1 as a target of miR-214. Effect of altering the expression of miR-214 or HMGA1 on proliferation, migration and invasion of human cervical and colorectal cancer cells was investigated.\nmiR-214 expression was poor while that of HMGA1 was high in cervical and colorectal cancer tissues. miR-214-re-expression or HMGA1 downregulation inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells while miR-214 inhibition had opposite effects. miR-214 was demonstrated to bind to the wild-type 3' untranslated region of HMGA1 but not with its mutant.\nLow expression of miR-214 concurrent with elevated levels of HMGA1 may contribute to cervical and colorectal cancer progression. miR-214-mediated regulation of HMGA1 is a novel mechanism for its tumour-suppressive actions in human cervical and colorectal cancer cells and opens up avenues for novel therapeutic strategies for these two cancers.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 18 August 2016; doi:10.1038\/bjc.2016.234 www.bjcancer.com.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243d","authors":["Chandrasekaran, Karthik Subramanian","Sathyanarayanan, Anusha","Karunagaran, Devarajan"],"doi":"10.1038\/bjc.2016.234","first_seen_on":"2016-08-19T12:21:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-1827","0007-0920"],"journal":"British Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1471609279,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27537384?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27537384","pubdate":"2016-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MicroRNA-214 suppresses growth, migration and invasion through a novel target, high mobility group AT-hook 1, in human cervical and colorectal cancer cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna214-suppresses-growth-migration-invasion-through-novel-target-high-mobility-group-athook-1-h-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":7133948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253918,"mean":12.265294738044,"rank":214339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253918,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4257,"mean":9.133977443609,"rank":3949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4257,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":26.579142857143,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
