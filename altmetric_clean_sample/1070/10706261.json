Akabane, Aino, Chuzan, bovine ephemeral fever and Ibaraki viruses have repeatedly caused epizootic abnormal births and febrile illness in the cattle population. In addition, Peaton, Sathuperi, Shamonda and D'Aguilar viruses and epizootic hemorrhagic virus serotype 7 have recently emerged in Japan and are also considered to be involved in abnormal births in cattle. The above-mentioned viruses are hypothesized to circulate in tropical and subtropical Asia year round and to be introduced to temperate East Asia by long-distance aerial dispersal of infected vectors. To watch for arbovirus incursion and assess the possibility of its early warning, monitoring for arboviruses was conducted in the Yaeyama Islands, located at the most southwestern area of Japan, between 1994 and 2014.\nBlood sampling was conducted once a year, in the autumn, in 40 to 60 healthy cattle from the Yaeyama Islands. Blood samples were tested for arboviruses. A total of 33 arboviruses including Akabane, Peaton, Chuzan, D' Aguilar, Bunyip Creek, Batai and epizootic hemorrhagic viruses were isolated from bovine blood samples. Serological surveillance for the bovine arboviruses associated with cattle diseases in young cattle (ages 6-12 months: had only been alive for one summer) clearly showed their frequent incursion into the Yaeyama Islands. In some cases, the arbovirus incursions could be detected in the Yaeyama Islands prior to their spread to mainland Japan.\nWe showed that long-term surveillance in the Yaeyama Islands could estimate the activity of bovine arboviruses in neighboring regions and may provide a useful early warning for likely arbovirus infections in Japan. The findings in this study could contribute to the planning of prevention and control for bovine arbovirus infections in Japan and cooperative efforts among neighboring countries in East Asia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f6100004b5","authors":["Tomoko Kato","Tomoko Kato","Tohru Yanase","Moemi Suzuki","Yoshito Katagiri","Kazufumi Ikemiyagi","Katsunori Takayoshi","Hiroaki Shirafuji","Seiichi Ohashi","Kazuo Yoshida","Makoto Yamakawa","Tomoyuki Tsuda"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12917-016-0747-z","first_seen_on":"2016-08-19T17:35:38+00:00","issns":["1746-6148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1471661732,"links":["http:\/\/bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12917-016-0747-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12917-016-0747-z?site=bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4921034","pmid":"27342576","pubdate":"2016-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Transgenics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Veterinary Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"1","title":"Monitoring for bovine arboviruses in the most southwestern islands in Japan between 1994 and 2014","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monitoring-bovine-arboviruses-most-southwestern-islands-japan-between-1994-2014"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":5966218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1990423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253935,"mean":12.265144777777,"rank":165515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":73278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253935,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1258,"mean":2.7569673826571,"rank":697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1258,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":1.8584507042254,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
