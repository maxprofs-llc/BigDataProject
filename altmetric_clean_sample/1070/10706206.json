Highlights of our synthetic efforts include an efficient late-stage functionalization that allows for the preparation of new side-chain- and backbone-modified analogues. We also discovered C-terminal modifications that preserve the exquisite biological activity of acid 1 and offer the opportunity for effective conjugation to cell type-targeting moieties. All analogues had antiproliferative activities in the high picomolar to low nanomolar range and caused apoptosis and mitotic arrest as measured in a high content nuclear morphology assay. The ten synthetic agents described herein spanned a range of almost 4 orders of magnitude in biological activity and illustrate the continued potential to discover extraordinarily potent antiproliferative compounds based on natural product leads.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Raffaele Colombo"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.joc.6b01314","first_seen_on":"2016-08-19T17:31:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6904","0022-3263"],"issue":"21","journal":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1472484408,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.joc.6b01314?hootPostID=4e36aa577cbc69323ae7d327aad9ac87"],"pmid":"27447195","pubdate":"2016-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Total Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Tubulysin Analogues","type":"article","volume":"81","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/total-synthesis-biological-evaluation-tubulysin-analogues"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":3543641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4739152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254462,"mean":12.266835507209,"rank":101295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":152667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254462,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3840,"mean":3.2105485803595,"rank":2243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":1573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3840,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":1.7549438202247,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
