Although several studies have examined the relationship between neighborhood environments and human health, we are unaware of studies that have examined the distance-decay of this effect and then presented the risk results spatially. Our study is unique in that is explores the health effects in a less developed country compared to most studies that have focused on developed countries. The objective of our study is to quantify the distance-decay cardiorespiratory diseases risk related to 28 neighborhood aspects in the Federal District, Brazil and present this information spatially through risk maps of the region. Toward this end, we used a quantile regression model to estimate risk and GIS modeling techniques to create risk maps. Our analysis produced the following findings: i) a 2500 m increase in highway length was associated with a 46% increase in cardiorespiratory diseases; ii) 46,000 light vehicles in circulation (considering a buffer of \u2264500 m from residences) was associated with 6 hospital admissions (95% CI: 2.6, 14.6) per cardiorespiratory diseases; iii) 74,000 m(2) of commercial areas (buffer \u22641700 m) was associated with 12 hospital admissions (95% CI: 2.2, 20.8); iv) 1km(2) increase in green areas intra urban was associated with less two hospital admissions, and; vi) those who live \u2264500 m from the nearest point of wildfire are more likely to have cardiorespiratory diseases that those living >500 m. Our findings suggest that the approach used in this study can be an option to improve the public health policies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ee","authors":["Requia, Weeberb J","Roig, Henrique L","Adams, Matthew D","Zanobetti, Antonella","Koutrakis, Petros"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.envres.2016.07.038","endpage":"215","first_seen_on":"2016-08-19T14:07:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-0953","00139351"],"journal":"Environmental Research","last_mentioned_on":1471615911,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0013935116303243"],"pmid":"27497083","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"203","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Mapping distance-decay of cardiorespiratory disease risk related to neighborhood environments","type":"article","volume":"151","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mapping-distancedecay-cardiorespiratory-disease-risk-related-neighborhood-environments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":3689193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4467624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253919,"mean":12.265163730023,"rank":108189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":142218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253919,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2506,"mean":6.1908966067864,"rank":1838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2506,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":7.1878644067797,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
