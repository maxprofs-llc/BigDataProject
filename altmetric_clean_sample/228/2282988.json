A\u03b2 vaccination removes A\u03b2 deposits from the brain. A\u03b2 immunotherapy, however, may cause T cell- and\/or Fc-receptor-mediated brain inflammation and relocate parenchymal A\u03b2 deposits to blood vessels leading to cerebral hemorrhages. Because catalytic antibodies do not form stable immune complexes and A\u03b2 fragments produced by catalytic antibodies are less likely to form aggregates, A\u03b2-specific catalytic antibodies may have safer therapeutic profiles than reversibly-binding anti-A\u03b2 antibodies. Additionally, catalytic antibodies may remove A\u03b2 more efficiently than binding antibodies because a single catalytic antibody can hydrolyze thousands of A\u03b2 molecules. We previously isolated A\u03b2-specific catalytic antibody, IgVL5D3, with strong A\u03b2-hydrolyzing activity. Here, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of brain-targeted IgVL5D3 gene delivery via recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9) in an AD mouse model. One single injection of rAAV9-IgVL5D3 into the right ventricle of AD model mice yielded widespread, high expression of IgVL5D3 in the unilateral hemisphere. IgVL5D3 expression was readily detectable in the contralateral hemisphere but to a much lesser extent. IgVL5D3 expression was also confirmed in the cerebrospinal fluid. Prophylactic and therapeutic injection of rAAV9-IgVL5D3 reduced A\u03b2 load in the ipsilateral hippocampus of AD model mice. No evidence of hemorrhages, increased vascular amyloid deposits, increased proinflammatory cytokines, or infiltrating T-cells in the brains was found in the experimental animals. AAV9-mediated anti-A\u03b2 catalytic antibody brain delivery can be prophylactic and therapeutic options for AD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ec5","authors":["Jinghong Kou","Junling Yang","Jeong-Eun Lim","Abhinandan Pattanayak","Min Song","Stephanie Planque","Sudhir Paul","Ken-Ichiro Fukuchi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12035-014-8691-z","first_seen_on":"2014-04-16T07:03:02+00:00","issns":["1559-1182"],"journal":"Molecular Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1397631718,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24733587"],"pmid":"24733587","pubdate":"2014-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neurology"],"title":"Catalytic Immunoglobulin Gene Delivery in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease: Prophylactic and Therapeutic Applications.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/catalytic-immunoglobulin-gene-delivery-mouse-model-alzheimers-disease-prophylactic-therapeutic-appli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3060282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":939451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101867,"mean":7.8935318555752,"rank":69255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":21920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101867,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":661,"mean":3.4881121212121,"rank":345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":661,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":3.1885714285714,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
