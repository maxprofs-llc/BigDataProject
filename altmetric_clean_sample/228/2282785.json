In Huntington disease, polyglutamine expansion causes N-terminal huntingtin (Htt) to misfold, inducing neurodegeneration. Here we report that shorter N-terminal Htt fragments are more stable than longer fragments and find differential ubiquitination via K63 of ubiquitin. Aging decreases proteasome-mediated Htt degradation, at the same time increasing K63-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent Htt aggregation in HD knock-in mice. The association of Htt with the K48-specific E3 ligase, Ube3a, is decreased in aged mouse brain. Overexpression of Ube3a in HD mouse brain reduces K63-mediated ubiquitination and Htt aggregation, enhancing its degradation via the K48 ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our findings suggest that aging-dependent Ube3a levels result in differential ubiquitination and degradation of Htt fragments, thereby contributing to the age-related neurotoxicity of mutant Htt.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Kavita P.
