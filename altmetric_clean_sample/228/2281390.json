We hypothesized that interactions between genetic variants and methylation in genes in this pathway (IL4, IL4R, IL13, GATA3, and STAT6) influence asthma risk, that such influences are age-dependent, and that methylation of some CpG sites changes over time in accordance with asthma transition. We tested these hypotheses in subsamples of girls from a population-based birth cohort established on the Isle of Wight, UK, in 1989.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007fb","doi":"10.1186\/1868-7083-6-8","first_seen_on":"2014-04-15T15:26:48+00:00","funders":["niaid","mrc"],"issns":["1868-7083","1868-7075"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Epigenetics","last_mentioned_on":1399486675,"links":["http:\/\/www.clinicalepigeneticsjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/8\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24735657?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.clinicalepigeneticsjournal.com\/content\/6\/1\/8"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalepigeneticsjournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1868-7083-6-8.pdf","pmid":"24735657","pubdate":"2014-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","startpage":"8","title":"The interplay of DNA methylation over time with Th2 pathway genetic variants on asthma risk and temporal asthma transition","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interplay-dna-methylation-time-th2-pathway-genetic-variants-asthma-risk-temporal-asthma-transition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1650053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2825187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106841,"mean":7.8221969487086,"rank":33103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":72884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106841,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":5.1703495145631,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.92,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
