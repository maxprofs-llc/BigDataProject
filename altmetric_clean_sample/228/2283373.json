In this study, we found that miR-99a was remarkably decreased in 111 of 152 (73.03%) primary HCC tissues and low-level expression of miR-99a was correlated with low tumor differentiation (P=0.001), liver cirrhosis (P=0.015), poor tumor-free survival (P=0.004) and overall survival (P=0.006) for HCC patients. By restoration of miR-99a, the HCC growth could be considerably inhibited both in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, Argonaute-2 (Ago2), a central component of RNA-induced silencing complex, was found to be directly regulated by miR-99a via translational repression. Overexpression of Ago2 could partly impair the inhibitory effect of miR-99a on HCC cells in vitro. Then, we demonstrated that Ago2 was upregulated in HCC tissues at both RNA and protein levels and the expression of AGO2 protein and miR-99a was negatively correlated within detected HCC tissues (r=-0.727, P=0.004). Interestingly, the tumorigenicity of Ago2-knockdown HCC cells was severely impaired (4\/10 vs 10\/10, P<0.05), and this was in contrast to the miR-99a-overexpressing HCC cells. Functionally, the increased AGO2 protein could specifically facilitate oncogenic miR-21 to repress its targeted gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) in HCC, whereas leave the regulatory capacity of let-7a on its targeted oncogenes almost unaltered. In summary, our study has revealed a novel pathway for the tumor suppressor miR-99a to control tumor growth in HCC, via its downstream signaling of AGO2\/miR-21\/PTEN. In addition, this study provides potential strategies for HCC therapy by reintroduction of miRNA suppressors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"54340e412a83ee936f8b4567","authors":["J Zhang","H Jin","H Liu","S Lv","B Wang","R Wang","H Liu","M Ding","Y Yang","L Li","J Zhang","S Fu","D Xie","M Wu","W Zhou","Q Qian"],"doi":"10.1038\/oncsis.2014.11","first_seen_on":"2014-04-16T10:12:23+00:00","issns":["2157-9024"],"journal":"Oncogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1397657300,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24732044?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24732044","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"MiRNA-99a directly regulates AGO2 through translational repression in hepatocellular carcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mirna99a-directly-regulates-ago2-through-translational-repression-hepatocellular-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508238,"mean":5.1674528195662,"rank":2860750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1479617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508238,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101886,"mean":7.9676347646859,"rank":63279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":34700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101886,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":2.0328125,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
