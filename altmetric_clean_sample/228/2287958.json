A family of blue-green absorbing, Ru(II)-based transition metal complexes derived from the \u03c0-expansive dppn ligand was prepared and characterized according to its photodynamic activity against HL-60 cells, and toward DNA in cell-free media. Complexes in this series that are characterized by low-energy and long-lived (3)IL excited states photocleaved DNA with blue, green, red, and near-IR light. This panchromatic photodynamic effect translated to in vitro multiwavelength photodynamic therapy (PDT) with red-light cytotoxicities as low as 1.5 \u03bcM (EC50) for the parent complex and 400 nM for its more lipophilic counterpart. This potency is similar to that achieved with Ru(II)-based dyads containing long-lived (3)IL excitons located on appended pyrenyl units, and appears to be a general property of sufficiently long-lived excited states. Moreover, the red PDT observed for certain members of this family was almost 5 times more potent than Photofrin with therapeutic indices 30 times greater. Related Ru(II) complexes having lowest-lying (3)MLCT states of much shorter duration (\u22641 \u03bcs) did not yield DNA photodamage or in vitro PDT with red or near-IR light, nor did the corresponding Os(II) complex with a submicrosecond (3)IL excited state lifetime. Therefore, metal complexes that utilize highly photosensitizing (3)IL excited states, with suitably long lifetimes (\u226b 1 \u03bcs), are well-poised to elicit PDT at wavelengths even where their molar extinction coefficients are very low (<100 M(-1) cm(-1)). Herein we demonstrate that such unexpected reactivity gives rise to very effective PDT in the typical therapeutic window (600-850 nm).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Huimin Yin"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic5002368","first_seen_on":"2014-04-17T21:19:18+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["0020-1669"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1397305641,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic5002368"],"pmid":"24725142","pubdate":"2014-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"In Vitro Multiwavelength PDT with <sup>3<\/sup>IL States: Teaching Old Molecules New Tricks.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-multiwavelength-pdt-3il-states-teaching-old-molecules-new-tricks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3060195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":939447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106989,"mean":7.7511248738179,"rank":72492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":23099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106989,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.2444788262754,"rank":2607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":306,"mean":1.6882557377049,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":306,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
