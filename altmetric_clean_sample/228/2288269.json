We report the indications and outcomes in patients who underwent LT after HCT for hematologic disease from a retrospective case series at our institution and a review of the medical literature. We identified a total of 70 cases of LT after HCT, including 9 allogeneic HCT recipients from our institution who underwent LT between 1990 and 2010. In our cohort, the median age was 16 years (range, 10 to 35 years) at the time of HCT and 34 years (range, 17 to 44 years) at the time of LT, with a median interval between HCT and LT of 10 years (range, 2.9 to 27 years). Indications for LT-included pulmonary fibrosis (n\u00a0= 4), BOS (n\u00a0= 3), interstitial pneumonitis related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (n\u00a0= 1), and primary pulmonary hypertension (n\u00a0= 1). Median survival was 49 months (range, 2 weeks to 87 months), and 1 patient remains alive at more than 3 years after LT. Survival at 1 year and 5 years after LT was 89% and 37%, respectively. In the medical literature between 1992 and July 2013, we identified 20 articles describing 61 cases of LT after HCT from various centers in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Twenty-six of the 61 cases (43%) involved patients age <18 years at the time of LT. BOS and GVHD of the lung were cited as the indication for LT in the majority of cases (80%; n\u00a0= 49), followed by pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease (20%; n\u00a0= 12). In publications reporting 3 or more cases with a follow-up interval ranging from the immediate postoperative period to 16 years, the survival rate was 71% (39 of 55). Most deaths were attributed to long-term complications of the lung allograft, including infections and BOS. Two deaths were related to recurrent or relapsed hematologic malignancy. LT can prolong survival in some patients who suffer from end-stage pulmonary complications after HCT. Patient factors that likely improve the chances of a good long-term outcome include young age, at least 2 years post-HCT free of relapse from the original hematologic malignancy, and lack of other end-organ dysfunction or manifestations of chronic GVHD that require treatment with immunosuppressive agents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e3","authors":["Cheng, Guang-Shing","Edelman, Jeffrey D.","Madtes, David K.","Martin, Paul J.","Flowers, Mary E.D."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbmt.2014.04.008","first_seen_on":"2014-04-18T00:02:31+00:00","issns":["1083-8791"],"journal":"Biology of Blood & Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1405038910,"links":["http:\/\/www.bbmt.org\/article\/S1083-8791(14)00225-0\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bbmt.org\/article\/S1083-8791(14)00225-0\/pdf","pmid":"24727334","pubdate":"2014-04-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Outcomes of Lung Transplantation After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-lung-transplantation-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2299684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1609517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107344,"mean":7.7545153014172,"rank":52914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":38158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107344,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":805,"mean":2.2536293532338,"rank":376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":805,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":3.7811282051282,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hema_News\/status\/456945781090840576","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2288269],"posted_on":"2014-04-18T00:02:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Hematopoiesis News","url":"http:\/\/www.hematopoiesisnews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748294208570556416\/50mx-B9p_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for the hematopoiesis community.
