Several reports demonstrate that SA limits nematode reproduction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d4","authors":["Benjamin F Matthews","Hunter Beard","Eric Brewer","Sara Kabir","Margaret H Macdonald","Reham M Youssef"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2229-14-96","first_seen_on":"2014-04-18T10:25:28+00:00","issns":["1471-2229"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Plant Biology","last_mentioned_on":1398275639,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24739302?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24739302","pubdate":"2014-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMC Plant Biology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Arabidopsis genes, AtNPR1, AtTGA2 and AtPR-5, confer partial resistance to soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) when overexpressed in transgenic soybean roots.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arabidopsis-genes-atnpr1-attga2-atpr5-confer-partial-resistance-soybean-cyst-nematode-heterodera-gly"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2273620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":2207917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107344,"mean":7.7559098963139,"rank":51945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":54472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107344,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":776,"mean":2.5734296774194,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":776,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":3.3787111111111,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
