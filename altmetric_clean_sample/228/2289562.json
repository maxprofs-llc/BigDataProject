The complement system is a critical innate immune defense against both pathogens. To assess the role of the complement system in the host defense and the pathogenesis of acute pneumococcal OM following IAV infection, we employed a well-established transtympanically-induced mouse model of acute pneumococcal OM. We found that antecedent IAV infection enhanced the severity of acute pneumococcal OM. Mice deficient in complement C1qa (C1qa-\/-) or factor B (Bf -\/-) exhibited delayed viral and bacterial clearance from the middle ear and developed significant mucosal damage in the eustachian tube and middle ear. This indicates that both the classical and alternative complement pathways are critical for the oto-immune defense against acute pneumococcal OM following influenza infection. We also found that Spn increased complement activation following IAV infection. This was characterized by sustained increased levels of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a in serum and middle ear lavage samples. In contrast, mice deficient in the complement C5a receptor (C5aR) demonstrated enhanced bacterial clearance and reduced severity of OM. Our data support the concept that C5a-C5aR interactions play a significant role in the pathogenesis of acute pneumococcal OM following IAV infection. It is possible that targeting the C5a-C5aR axis might prove useful in attenuating acute pneumococcal OM in patients with influenza infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Hua Hua Tong","Garrett Lambert","Yong Xing Li","Joshua M Thurman","Gregory L Stahl","Kelsey Douthitt","Caitlin Clancy","Yujuan He","Andrew S Bowman"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0095160","first_seen_on":"2014-04-18T13:25:29+00:00","funders":["niaid","nhlbi"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1433311385,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24740152?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24740152","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Deletion of the Complement C5a Receptor Alleviates the Severity of Acute Pneumococcal Otitis Media following Influenza A Virus Infection in Mice.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deletion-complement-c5a-receptor-alleviates-severity-acute-pneumococcal-otitis-media-following-influ"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5181074,"mean":6.1197115118841,"rank":2563152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2463039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5181074,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127141,"mean":7.9841343558283,"rank":57992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":64829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127141,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91091,"mean":9.4495461850917,"rank":46571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":39820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91091,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3979,"mean":11.383929110106,"rank":2073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3979,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
