In this paper, we summarize updates of allergen names approved at the meetings of the committee in 2011 through 2013. These changes reflect recent progress in identification, cloning, and sequencing of allergens. The goals of this update were to increase consistency in the classification of allergens, isoallergens, and variants and in the incorporation of the evolutionary classification of proteins into allergen nomenclature, while keeping changes of established names to a minimum in the interest of continuity. Allergens for which names have been updated include respiratory allergens from birch and ragweed pollen, midge larvae, and horse dander; food allergens from peanut, cow's milk, and tomato; and cereal grain allergens. The IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Sub-Committee encourages researchers to use these updated allergen names in future publications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021d3","authors":["C Radauer","A Nandy","F Ferreira","R E Goodman","J N Larsen","J Lidholm","A Pom\u00e9s","M Raulf-Heimsoth","P Rozynek","W R Thomas","H Breiteneder"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-17T10:00:51+00:00","issns":["1398-9995"],"issue":"4","journal":"Allergy","last_mentioned_on":1414577693,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24738154?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24738154"],"pmid":"24738154","pubdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Update of the WHO\/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Database based on analysis of allergen sequences.","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/update-whoiuis-allergen-nomenclature-database-based-analysis-allergen-sequences"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":1920005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3067804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123892,"mean":7.9421270471627,"rank":39372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":83516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123892,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1550,"mean":5.7556126533247,"rank":915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1550,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":9.4500869565217,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
