The operation was a disaster. Suture tension was responsible for gangrene that required amputation of the operated leg. The outcome of the lawsuit was severe for Dujarier who was required to pay 200,000 francs compensation, but even more so for plastic surgery that was practically outlawed. Two years later, Dujarier's sentence was confirmed, but plastic surgery was cleared and considered licit on condition that the patient's informed consent be obtained. Dujarier died shortly after the second ruling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002263","authors":["J Glicenstein"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-17T05:07:25+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0294-1260"],"issue":"3","journal":"Annales de Chirurgie Plastique Esthetique","last_mentioned_on":1447217307,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2473691"],"pmid":"2473691","pubdate":"1989-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"[Dujarier's case].","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dujariers-case"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6559289,"mean":6.0768461753774,"rank":3116066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1958487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6559289,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148637,"mean":7.7344074921286,"rank":73893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":55658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148637,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":1.3087415730337,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lipocoalition\/status\/508717455053578240","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2285866],"posted_on":"2014-09-07T20:44:27+00:00","author":{"name":"LipoCoalition","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/456659778450644992\/IV87uphC_normal.jpeg","description":"This information is offered for educational purposes only.
