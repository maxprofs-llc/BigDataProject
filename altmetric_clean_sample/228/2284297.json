We hypothesized that estrogen-induced gene expression could establish an immunoactivated state which would render enhanced defense against infection, but may be deleterious in autoimmune development. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we demonstrate enhanced responses with immunogen stimulation in the presence of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) and gene array analyses reveal toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) as an E2-responsive candidate gene. TLR8 expression levels are up-regulated in SLE and PBMCs stimulated with TLR8 agonist display a female sex-biased, E2-sensitive response. Moreover, we identify a putative ER\u03b1-binding region near the TLR8 locus and blocking ER\u03b1 expression significantly decreases E2-mediated TLR8 induction. Our findings characterize TLR8 as a novel estrogen target gene that can lower the inflammatory threshold and implicate an IFN\u03b1-independent inflammatory mechanism that could contribute to higher SLE incidence in women.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255c","authors":["Young NA","Wu LC","Burd CJ","Friedman AK","Kaffenberger BH","Rajaram MV","Schlesinger LS","James H","Shupnik MA","Jarjour WN","Nicholas A.
