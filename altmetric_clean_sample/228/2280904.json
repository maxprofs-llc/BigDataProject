We achieved this by eliminating the influence of higher order aberrations (HOAs) with adaptive optics correction. We measured HOAs, modulation transfer functions (MTFs) and contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs) of six children and five adults with both corrected and uncorrected HOAs. We found that when HOAs were corrected, children and adults both showed improvements in MTF and CSF. However, the CSF of children was still lower than the adult level, indicating the difference in contrast sensitivity between groups cannot be explained by differences in optical factors. Further study showed that the difference between the groups also could not be explained by differences in non-visual factors. With these results we concluded that the neural systems underlying vision in children of around 8 years old are still immature in contrast sensitivity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Rong Liu","Jiawei Zhou","Haoxin Zhao","Yun Dai","Yudong Zhang","Yong Tang","Yifeng Zhou"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep04687","first_seen_on":"2014-04-15T12:33:03+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1397565552,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep04687"],"pmid":"24732728","pubdate":"2014-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Visual system","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Neuroscience","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Developmental biology","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Immature visual neural system in children reflected by contrast sensitivity with adaptive optics correction","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immature-visual-neural-system-children-reflected-contrast-sensitivity-adaptive-optics-correction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":3550735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":838493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123356,"mean":8.0010083093514,"rank":82412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":22942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123356,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15807,"mean":13.321162723017,"rank":11662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":2450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15807,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":681,"mean":8.4381117647059,"rank":510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":681,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
