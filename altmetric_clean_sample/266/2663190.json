The results were assessed by examination, radiography and completion of the short form-36 questionnaire and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score. Of the 57 fractures 55 healed without further treatment. The mean combined dorsi- and plantar flexion was 52.3 degrees (25 degrees to 82 degrees ) and the mean short form-36 and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scores 48.1 (28 to 60) and 89.8 (69 to 100), respectively. At review there was no evidence of medial instability, dermatological complications, malalignment of the mortise or of post-traumatic arthritis. Isolated fractures of the medial malleolus can obtain high rates of union and good functional results with conservative treatment. Operation should be reserved for bi- or trimalleolar fractures, open fractures, injuries which compromise the skin or those involving the plafond or for patients who develop painful nonunion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059fd","authors":["Herscovici D Jr","Scaduto JM","Infante A"],"doi":"10.1302\/0301-620x.89b1.18349","first_seen_on":"2014-09-08T00:03:07+00:00","issns":["0301-620X"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Bone & Joint Journal","last_mentioned_on":1410134325,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17259423"],"pmid":"17259423","pubdate":"2007-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Conservative treatment of isolated fractures of the medial malleolus.","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conservative-treatment-isolated-fractures-medial-malleolus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4224397,"mean":5.1282519390988,"rank":3370910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":119223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4224397,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109896,"mean":8.2903622366805,"rank":87665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109896,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1177,"mean":3.8870238095238,"rank":1070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1177,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":6.9863636363636,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
