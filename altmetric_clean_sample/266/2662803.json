The phytochemical analysis of CL fruit bark essential oil showed two majority components, limonene (LIM) and \u03b2-pinene (PIN). This study aimed to evaluate the gastroprotective mechanism of action from CL, LIM and PIN in ethanol- and indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers and its in vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori activity. After ethanol-induced gastric ulcer, the ulcer area was measured and the stomachs were destined to histology (HE and PAS), immunohistochemistry for HSP-70 and VIP and glutathione (GSH) measurement. The involvement of nitric oxide (NO) and sulfhydryl (SH) compounds was determined. The ulcer area for indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers was measured. PGE\u2082 concentration was biochemically measured. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against H. pylori was determined in vitro. In ethanol model, CL and LIM demonstrated 100% of gastroprotection, while PIN did not exert effective gastroprotection (53.26%). In the indomethacin model, CL and LIM offered effective gastroprotection but PIN did not show gastroprotective effect. The gastric ulcer area of rats pretreated with NO-synthase inhibitor or SH-blocker was decreased in comparison to the control group. The MIC obtained for CL was 125 \u03bcg\/mL, for LIM was 75 \u03bcg\/mL and for PIN was 500 \u03bcg\/mL. The gastroprotective effect of CL and LIM was involved with increasing in mucus secretion, HSP-70 and VIP, but not with GSH, NO or SH compounds. CL gastroprotective mechanism is involved with PGE\u2082. PIN did not present gastroprotective activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ef","authors":["Rozza AL","Moraes Tde M","Kushima H","Tanimoto A","Marques MO","Bauab TM","Hiruma-Lima CA","Pellizzon CH"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbi.2010.09.031","first_seen_on":"2014-09-07T17:55:32+00:00","issns":["00092797"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Chemico-Biological Interactions","last_mentioned_on":1502445564,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0009279710005776","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20934418","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cbi.2010.09.031"],"pmid":"20934418","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Gastroprotective mechanisms of Citrus lemon (Rutaceae) essential oil and its majority compounds limonene and \u03b2-pinene: involvement of heat-shock protein-70, vasoactive intestinal peptide, glutathione, sulfhydryl compounds, nitric oxide and prostaglandin E\u2082.","type":"article","volume":"189","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gastroprotective-mechanisms-citrus-lemon-rutaceae-essential-oil-majority-compounds-limonene-%CE%B2pinene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":26.75,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":26.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":335260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":8019461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189341,"mean":7.8650221083767,"rank":9609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":179703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189341,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":956,"mean":2.9432732984293,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":956,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.84615384615385,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
