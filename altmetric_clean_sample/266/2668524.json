Full-length tissue factor (flTF) is a transmembrane receptor for FVII\/VIIa and is essentially undetectable in the blood of healthy individuals. However, intravascular levels of flTF are increased in a variety of diseases, including cancer and endotoxemia [1]. The majority of active flTF in plasma in these disease states is present on MPs.
