However, much research treats these conditions as a single disorder when they differ significantly in terms of their disease burden. This paper examines the socio-economic pattern of anxiety and depression separately and longitudinally to develop a better understanding of their disease burden for key social groups at different ages.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d9","authors":["M.
