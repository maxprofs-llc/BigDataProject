The device is designed to be used with freely behaving small laboratory animals and allows recording of spontaneous and evoked neural activity wirelessly transmitted and stored on a personal computer. Biphasic current stimuli with programmable duration, frequency and amplitude may be triggered in real-time on the basis of the recorded neural activity as well as by the animal behavior within a specifically designed experimental setup. An intuitive graphical user interface was developed to configure and to monitor the whole system. The system was successfully tested through bench tests and in vivo measurements on behaving rats chronically implanted with multi-channels microwire arrays.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Gian Nicola Angotzi","Fabio Boi","Stefano Zordan","Andrea Bonfanti","Alessandro Vato"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep05963","first_seen_on":"2014-09-08T13:47:16+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1446006964,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2014\/140806\/srep05963\/full\/srep05963.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25096831?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25096831","pubdate":"2014-08-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical engineering","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Electrical and electronic engineering","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Sensorimotor processing","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"A programmable closed-loop recording and stimulating wireless system for behaving small laboratory animals.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/programmable-closedloop-recording-stimulating-wireless-system-behaving-small-laboratory-animals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6500718,"mean":6.0222432796255,"rank":2404359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3998768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6500718,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157328,"mean":8.2508175074846,"rank":56992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":97150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157328,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22454,"mean":14.145673807509,"rank":9443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":12498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22454,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":560,"mean":13.976915921288,"rank":245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":560,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
