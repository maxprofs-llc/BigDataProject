Data on symptoms and functional outcomes were obtained every 3 months. A mixed effects regression model with repeated measures using a 2 (CAT\/no CAT) \u00d7 2 (CBT\/no CBT) design indicated that functioning as measured by the Multnomah Community Ability Scale improved more in groups receiving CAT than other treatment groups. Auditory hallucinations and associated distress improved slightly more in groups receiving CAT. In this study, CBTp did not improve outcomes. Combining CAT with CBTp did not improve outcomes more than CAT alone.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f61000889b","authors":["Dawn I Velligan","Sara Tai","David L Roberts","Natalie Maples-Aguilar","Matt Brown","Jim Mintz","Douglas Turkington","Velligan DI","Tai S","Roberts DL","Maples-Aguilar N","Brown M","Mintz J","Turkington D","D.
