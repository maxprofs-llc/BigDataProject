MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have been shown to modulate a wide range of biological functions under various pathophysiological conditions. miRNAs alter target expression by post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Numerous studies have implicated specific miRNAs in cardiovascular development, pathology, regeneration and repair. These observations suggest that miRNAs are potential therapeutic targets to prevent or treat cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on the emerging role of miRNAs in cardiac development, pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, cardiac regeneration and stem cell-mediated cardiac repair. We also discuss the novel diagnostic and therapeutic potential of these miRNAs and their targets in patients with cardiac diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Darukeshwara Joladarashi","Joladarashi D","Thandavarayan RA","Babu SS","Krishnamurthy P","Rajarajan Thandavarayan","Sahana Babu","Prasanna Krishnamurthy"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms150915891","endpage":"15911","first_seen_on":"2014-09-09T08:42:05+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1422-0067",""],"issue":"9","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1410252070,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/15\/9\/15891"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/15\/9\/15891\/pdf","pmid":"25207600","pubdate":"2014-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"15891","title":"Small Engine, Big Power: MicroRNAs as Regulators of Cardiac Diseases and Regeneration","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/15\/9\/15891\/","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/small-engine-big-power-micrornas-regulators-cardiac-diseases-regeneration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4282690,"mean":5.0215424405332,"rank":3398014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4282690,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111321,"mean":8.0332130255122,"rank":88108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111321,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1836,"mean":1.5662822888283,"rank":1044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":7.9394736842105,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
