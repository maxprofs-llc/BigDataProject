Clinical trial data suggest that antiarrhythmic drugs are only marginally effective and have multiple drawbacks, whereas rate control alone is sufficient for most patients with minimally symptomatic AF. This study investigates changes in the use of oral rate and rhythm control therapy for AF during fiscal years 2002 through 2011 in the US Veterans Affairs (VA) health system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6083cf058f61000696a","authors":["Vaughan-Sarrazin MS","Mazur A","Chrischilles E","Cram P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ahj.2014.03.024","first_seen_on":"2014-09-08T14:46:29+00:00","issns":["0002-8703"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Heart Journal","last_mentioned_on":1410187534,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24952860"],"pmid":"24952860","pubdate":"2014-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Trends in the pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation: Data from the Veterans Affairs health system.","type":"article","volume":"168","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trends-pharmacologic-management-atrial-fibrillation-data-veterans-affairs-health-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3055042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115899,"mean":8.2147219279024,"rank":75836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":26992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115899,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1141,"mean":4.2387140350877,"rank":764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1141,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.7865384615385,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":12,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"PL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AFib_UMN\/status\/508989526870876161","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2664795],"posted_on":"2014-09-08T14:45:34+00:00","author":{"name":"AFib UMN","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2870621886\/0a4234534f2e0839db755be12431f054_normal.jpeg","description":"Interested in atrial fibrillation (AFib) research, based at the University of Minnesota","id_on_source":"AFib_UMN","tweeter_id":"958521348","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":105},"tweet_id":"508989526870876161"}]}}
