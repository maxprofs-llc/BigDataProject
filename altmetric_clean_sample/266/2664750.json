All the filler NPs were in monodispersed state and the interactions between these particles were purely repulsive. The polymer-particle interactions were attractive and their interaction energies were tuned in a broad range. Through the computational study, many important features of the behavior of particle-reinforced elastomers observed in experiments, including the Payne effect, were successfully reproduced. It was shown that the magnitude of the Payne effect was found to depend on the polymer-particle interaction and the filler loading. By examining the microstructures of the simulation systems and their evolution during oscillatory shear, four different mechanisms for the role of the polymer-particle interactions in the Payne effect were revealed that consist of the debonding of polymer chains from NP surfaces, the breakage of polymer-shell-bridged NP network, the rearrangement of the NPs in the network into different layers and the shear-induced yielding of the rigid polymer shell in-between neighboring NPs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Yulong Chen","Yulong Chen","Ziwei Li","Shipeng Wen","Qingyuan Yang","Liqun Zhang","Chongli Zhong","Li Liu"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4894502","first_seen_on":"2014-09-08T14:30:32+00:00","issns":["1089-7690"],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1410186590,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/jcp\/141\/10\/10.1063\/1.4894502"],"pmid":"25217945","pubdate":"2014-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Molecular simulation study of role of polymer\u2013particle interactions in the strain-dependent viscoelasticity of elastomers (Payne effect)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-simulation-study-role-polymerparticle-interactions-straindependent-viscoelasticity-elastom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3040237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115898,"mean":8.2441002959528,"rank":75544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":26697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115898,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3787,"mean":2.0595171685156,"rank":1848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3787,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214,"mean":2.9273427230047,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
