Recently a deletion encompassing the GJB6 gene was identified and hypothesized to also contribute to hearing loss. We hereby describe the hearing impairment in Dutch patients with biallelic connexin 26 (GJB2) and GJB2+connexin 30 (GJB6) mutations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b88","authors":["Santos RL","Aulchenko YS","Huygen PL","van der Donk KP","de Wijs IJ","Kemperman MH","Admiraal RJ","Kremer H","Hoefsloot LH","Cremers CW","Regie Lyn P.
