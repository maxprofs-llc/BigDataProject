There are many forms of neuro-ophthalmological involvement secondary to syphilis, and not all of them are well known. Our aim is to determine the clinical and therapeutic differences in these patients. CASE REPORTS. Our sample included eight patients diagnosed with an ocular and neuro-ophthalmological disorder due to syphilis over the years 2012 and 2013. Five of them presented uveitis, pan-eveitis being the most frequent, with three cases. Two cases presented papilloedema and another displayed retrobulbar optic neuropathy. A total of 62.5% were diagnosed with neurosyphilis, the presence of which was related with compromise of the optic nerve (p = 0.035). None of them gave positive for VDRL in cerebrospinal fluid and they were diagnosed by the presence of FTA antibodies together with high protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid, lymphocytic pleocytosis or intrathecal synthesis of antibodies. In the absence of uveitis, diagnosis was delayed by a mean time of 2.6 months (p = 0.047). All the patients, except one who required a vitrectomy, progressed favourably with intravenous antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS. In cases of neuro-ophthalmological compromise, whether inflammatory or non-inflammatory, the physician must bear syphilis in mind as a potential causation in order to avoid delays in the diagnosis, since early well-tailored treatment can prevent permanent loss of sight.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90e3cf058f61000cbca","authors":["Crespo-Burillo JA","Gil-Perez D","Alarcia-Alejos R","Hernando-Quintana N","Garcia-Rubio S","Martin-Martinez J"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-09T15:22:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Revista de neurologia","last_mentioned_on":1410278944,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25190339?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25190339","pubdate":"2014-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"[Clinical and therapeutic differences in neuro-ophthalmological involvement secondary to syphilis].","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-therapeutic-differences-neuroophthalmological-involvement-secondary-syphilis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2895686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1455074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115853,"mean":8.1430619238341,"rank":69619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":41723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115853,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":418,"mean":1.5600767386091,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":202,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":418,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.4,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
