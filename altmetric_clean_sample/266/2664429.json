Falls that occur while walking and turning have also been associated with an increased risk of hip fracture in older people. Despite the importance of stability during turning, there has been little focus on identifying this impairment in at risk older people, or in evaluating interventions aiming to improve this outcome. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a 16 week tailored home based exercise program in older adults aged (50 years and above) who were identified as having unsteadiness during turning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ba","authors":["Ashari Asmidawati","Tengku Aizan Hamid","Rizal M Hussain","Keith D Hill"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2318-14-100","first_seen_on":"2014-09-08T12:18:05+00:00","issns":["1471-2318"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Geriatrics","last_mentioned_on":1414856689,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2318\/14\/100\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2318\/14\/100"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2318-14-100.pdf","pmid":"25196930","pubdate":"2014-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"100","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Home based exercise to improve turning and mobility performance among community dwelling older adults: protocol for a randomized controlled trial","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2318-14-100","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/home-based-exercise-improve-turning-mobility-performance-among-community-dwelling-older-adults-proto-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1985175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115897,"mean":8.1949159591361,"rank":46600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":65806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115897,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":493,"mean":3.8606341463415,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":493,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":4.6086666666667,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
