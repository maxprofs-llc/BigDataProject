The former reversible reaction was determined using a strong base and acid titration. The saturation state described by the pH\/PCO2 -independent solubility product, [Ca(2+) ][CO3 (2-) ], may not be observed at pH below 8.5 because [Ca(2+) ][CO3 (2-) ]\/([Ca(2+) ][HCO3 (-) ]) \u226a1. Since proton transfer dynamics controls all reversible acid dissociation reactions in saline waters, the concentrations of calcium ion and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were expressed as a function of dual variables, pH and PCO2 . The negative impact of ocean acidification on marine calcifying organisms was confirmed by applying the experimental culture data of each PCO2 \/pH-dependent coral polyp skeleton weight (Wskel) to the proton transfer idea. The skeleton formation of each coral polyp was performed in microspaces beneath its aboral ectoderm. This resulted in a decalcification of 14 weight\u2009%, a normalized CaCO3 saturation state \u039b of 1.3 at PCO2 \u2248400\u2005ppm and pH \u22488.0, and serious decalcification of 45\u2009% and \u039b 2.5 at PCO2 \u22481000\u2005ppm and pH \u22487.8.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Suwa, Ryota","Hatta, Masayuki","Ichikawa, Kazuhiko"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201402210","first_seen_on":"2014-09-09T11:53:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3765"],"journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1410251880,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/chem.201402210"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201402210\/pdf","pmid":"25179204","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Proton\u2010Transfer Reaction Dynamics and Energetics in Calcification and Decalcification","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protontransfer-reaction-dynamics-energetics-calcification-decalcification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.272,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.272},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4233385,"mean":5.1302730563925,"rank":673193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3559147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4233385,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109966,"mean":8.3108616014187,"rank":22422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":87506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109966,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2944,"mean":2.6885579340809,"rank":607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":2337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2944,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":3.6700266666667,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
