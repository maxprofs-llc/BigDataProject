Eligible patients completed the translated Chinese version of McGill questionnaires (MQOL-C), which had been examined before the study. Construct validity was preliminarily assessed through exploratory factor analysis extracting 4 factors that construct a new hypothesis model and then the original model was proved to be better confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. Internal consistency of all the subscales was within 0.582 to 0.917. Furthermore, test-retest reliability ranged from 0.509 to 0.859, which was determined by Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Face validation and feasibility also confirm the good validity of MQOL-C. The MQOL-C has satisfied validation in mainland Chinese patients with cancer, although cultural difference should be considered while using it.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005707","authors":["Liya Hu","Jingwen Li","Xu Wang","Sheila Payne","Yuan Chen","Qi Mei"],"doi":"10.1177\/1049909114537400","endpage":"714","first_seen_on":"2014-09-08T14:51:28+00:00","issns":["1938-2715","1049-9091"],"issue":"7","journal":"American journal of hospice & palliative care","last_mentioned_on":1410187834,"links":["http:\/\/ajh.sagepub.com\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/1049909114537400v1?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajh.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2014\/06\/16\/1049909114537400.full.pdf","pmid":"24939208","pubdate":"2014-06-15T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"709","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Prior Study of Cross-Cultural Validation of McGill Quality-of-Life Questionnaire in Mainland Mandarin Chinese Patients With Cancer","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prior-study-crosscultural-validation-mcgill-qualityoflife-questionnaire-mainland-mandarin-chinese-pa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4228725,"mean":5.1286036499957,"rank":3374658,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":119386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4228725,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109935,"mean":8.30022951953,"rank":87720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109935,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":526,"mean":2.2547504761905,"rank":367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":526,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.6,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
