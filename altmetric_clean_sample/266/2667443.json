Furthermore, we discuss the effects of preconditioning (PC), which is a well-known protective phenomenon for tissue ischaemia. The positive effect of both hypoxic and acidic PC on progenitor cell therapeutic potential is reviewed, while stressing the role of the SDF-1\/CXCR4 axis in this process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024b0","authors":["Chiara Cencioni","Maurizio C.
