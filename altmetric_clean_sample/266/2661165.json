Here, we address how interactions between cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors essential for myogenic growth arrest (p21(cip1) and p57(kip2)), the Notch pathway and myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) orchestrate the proliferation, specification and differentiation of muscle progenitor cells. We first show that cell cycle exit and myogenic differentiation can be uncoupled. In addition, we establish that skeletal muscle progenitor cells require Notch signaling to maintain their cycling status. Using several mouse models combined with ex vivo studies, we demonstrate that Notch signaling is required to repress p21(cip1) and p57(kip2) expression in muscle progenitor cells. Finally, we identify a muscle-specific regulatory element of p57(kip2) directly activated by MRFs in myoblasts but repressed by the Notch targets Hes1\/Hey1 in progenitor cells. We propose a molecular mechanism whereby information provided by Hes\/Hey downstream of Notch as well as MRF activities are integrated at the level of the p57(kip2) enhancer to regulate the decision between progenitor cell maintenance and muscle differentiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","authors":["Zalc A","Hayashi S","Aurad\u00e9 F","Br\u00f6hl D","Chang T","Mademtzoglou D","Mourikis P","Yao Z","Cao Y","Birchmeier C","Relaix F"],"doi":"10.1242\/dev.110155","first_seen_on":"2014-09-06T12:38:25+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"14","journal":"Development (09501991)","last_mentioned_on":1410007033,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25005473?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25005473","pubdate":"2014-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"Antagonistic regulation of p57kip2 by Hes\/Hey downstream of Notch signaling and muscle regulatory factors regulates skeletal muscle growth arrest.","type":"article","volume":"141","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antagonistic-regulation-p57-supkip2sup-heshey-downstream-notch-signaling-muscle-regulatory-factors-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616176,"mean":4.9318698536468,"rank":2015338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":924323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616176,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92673,"mean":7.186056047134,"rank":49390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92673,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3313,"mean":3.6761678743961,"rank":1824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3313,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":3.8875416666667,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
