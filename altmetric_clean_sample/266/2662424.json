As iron induces local changes in magnetic susceptibility, its presence can be visualized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The usual approach, based on iron induced changes in magnetic relaxation (T2\/T2'), is often prone, however, to confounding artifacts and lacks specificity. Here, we propose a new method to quantify and map iron deposits using water diffusion MRI. This method is based on the differential sensitivity of two image acquisition schemes to the local magnetic field gradients induced by iron deposits and their cross-term with gradient pulses used for diffusion encoding. Iron concentration could be imaged and estimated with high accuracy in the brain cortex, the thalamus, the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus of macaques, showing iron distributions in agreement with literature. Additionally, iron maps could clearly show a dramatic increase in iron content upon injection of an UltraSmall Particle Iron Oxide (USPIO) contrast agent, notably in the cortex and the thalamus, reflecting regional differences in blood volume. The method will benefit clinical investigations on the effect of iron deposits in the brain or other organs, as iron deposits are increasingly seen as a biomarker for a wide range of diseases, notably, neurodegenerative diseases in the pre-symptomatic stage. It also has the potential for quantifying variations in blood volume induced by brain activation in fMRI studies using USPIOs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","authors":["Shunro Fujiwara","Lynn Uhrig","Alexis Amadon","B\u00e9chir Jarraya","Denis Le Bihan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2014.08.049","first_seen_on":"2014-09-07T12:23:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-9572","10538119"],"journal":"NeuroImage","last_mentioned_on":1414342463,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25192653?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S105381191400723X","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S105381191400723X?via=ihub"],"pmid":"25192653","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Quantification of iron in the non-human primate brain with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantification-iron-nonhuman-primate-brain-diffusionweighted-magnetic-resonance-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6294277,"mean":5.9778739232289,"rank":1197314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5089934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6294277,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149676,"mean":8.3164841823954,"rank":35457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":113933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149676,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4674,"mean":6.9962961694843,"rank":1587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4674,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":4.8566153846154,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
