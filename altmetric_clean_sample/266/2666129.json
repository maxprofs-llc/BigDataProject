This CI can be used to diagnose specific examples of non-expert-like thinking in students and to evaluate the success of teaching strategies that target conceptual changes. We used BEDCI to diagnose non-expert-like student thinking in experimental design at the pre- and posttest stage in five courses (total n = 580 students) at a large research university in western Canada. Calculated difficulty and discrimination metrics indicated that BEDCI questions are able to effectively capture learning changes at the undergraduate level. A high correlation (r = 0.84) between responses by students in similar courses and at the same stage of their academic career, also suggests that the test is reliable. Students showed significant positive learning changes by the posttest stage, but some non-expert-like responses were widespread and persistent. BEDCI is a reliable and valid diagnostic tool that can be used in a variety of life sciences disciplines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e08","authors":["Thomas Deane","Kathy Nomme","Erica Jeffery","Carol Pollock","G\u00fclnur Birol"],"doi":"10.1187\/cbe.13-11-0218","first_seen_on":"2014-09-08T23:50:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1931-7913"],"journal":"CBE\u0097Life Sciences Education","last_mentioned_on":1413959952,"links":["http:\/\/www.lifescied.org\/content\/13\/3\/540.full","http:\/\/www.lifescied.org\/content\/13\/3\/540.full.pdf+html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.lifescied.org\/content\/13\/3\/540.full.pdf","pmid":"25185236","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["science","education","cellbiology"],"title":"Development of the Biological Experimental Design Concept Inventory (BEDCI)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-biological-experimental-design-concept-inventory-bedci-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1781836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2646703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115897,"mean":8.1250317698628,"rank":39325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":74257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115897,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266,"mean":6.7144603773585,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":25.873666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
