This paper offers further development of a view advanced previously, the Contrastive Model of Disease: it develops the account to handle asymptomatic disease (previously excluded); and in doing so it relates the model to a broadly biostatistical view of health (where before the model was neutral in the naturalism debate). The developments are prompted by considering cancers featuring viruses as prominent causes, since these appear to amount to cases where the prescriptions of the Contrastive Model could be followed, but aren't. The resulting Irrelevance Objection claims that the Contrastive Model is irrelevant to medical science and practice. The paper seeks to rebut the Irrelevance Objection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610002001","authors":["Alex Broadbent"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.shpsc.2014.07.010","first_seen_on":"2014-09-09T18:36:40+00:00","issns":["13698486"],"journal":"Studies in History & Philosophy of Biological & Biomedical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1417185866,"links":["http:\/\/rss.sciencedirect.com\/action\/redirectFile?&zone=main&currentActivity=feed&usageType=outward&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1369848614000910%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D7f2393efea0065f12a7514c53d42acff","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1369848614000910"],"pmid":"25194981","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"title":"Disease as a theoretical concept: The case of \u201cHPV-itis\u201d ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disease-theoretical-concept-case-hpvitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4559875,"mean":5.3532196658184,"rank":2950051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1440905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4559875,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116415,"mean":8.4524853883554,"rank":73034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":38526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116415,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":3.9811460674157,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":5.9307692307692,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
