However, in the case of medical devices, such clinical data may not always be available, because of the different nature of the regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the regulatory requirements in seven major jurisdictions in order to identify current challenges and to suggest possible improvements. There are differences in the requirements across jurisdictions and in the balance between pre-market and post-market controls. Several improvements are required in order to generate adequate clinical data for health technology assessment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d8","authors":["Rosanna Tarricone","Tarricone R","Torbica A","Ferr\u00e9 F","Drummond M"],"doi":"10.1586\/14737167.2014.950233","first_seen_on":"2014-09-09T03:39:18+00:00","issns":["1473-7167","1744-8379"],"issue":"5","journal":"Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research","last_mentioned_on":1410250339,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/14737167.2014.950233","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/14737167.2014.950233","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/14737167.2014.950233?ai=rv&mi=3dn1t0&af=R&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25196848","pubdate":"2014-10-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Generating appropriate clinical data for value assessment of medical devices: what role does regulation play?","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/generating-appropriate-clinical-data-value-assessment-medical-devices-role-regulation-play"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1857365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2595569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115856,"mean":8.2568484571235,"rank":42602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":71562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115856,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":326,"mean":1.4034953846154,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":326,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.1,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
