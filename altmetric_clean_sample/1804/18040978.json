Comparison of the predicted cell trajectory with observation demonstrates that simulation can predict fine-scale sperm dynamics at the qualitative level. The flow field is also observed to reduce to a time-dependent summation of regularized Stokes flow singularities, approximated at leading order by a blinking force triplet. Such regularized singularity decompositions may be used to upscale cell level detail into population models of human sperm motility.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Kenta Ishimoto","Hermes Gad\u00ealha","Eamonn A.
