Bioremediation has been a key strategy to control the massive presence of chemicals in the environment. Enzymes including the phenoloxidases, laccases and tyrosinases, are increasingly being investigated as \"green products\" in the removal of many chemical contaminants in waters and soils. Both phenoloxidases are widespread in nature and attractive biocatalysts due to their ability to use readily available molecular oxygen as sole cofactor for their catalytic elimination of a large number of chemicals. Taking advantage of their catalytic potentials, remarkable advances have been made in the engineering of laccases to produce suitable biocatalysts in environmental applications. Studies about novel strategies of laccase immobilization and insolubilization for the treatment of chemical contaminants were provided. Likewise, tyrosinases are gaining increasing interest in environmental applications due to their catalytic similarities with laccases although they remain far less investigated to date. This disparity was addressed in this review along with the molecular features and catalytic mechanism of tyrosinases relevant in environmental applications. A perspective on the future use of laccases and tyrosinases in bioremediation was discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cd3cf058f61000050f","authors":["Sidy Ba","Vaidyanathan Vinoth Kumar"],"doi":"10.1080\/07388551.2016.1261081","first_seen_on":"2017-03-23T20:20:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0738-8551","1549-7801"],"journal":"Critical Reviews in Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1490300626,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/07388551.2016.1261081","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/07388551.2016.1261081"],"pmid":"28330374","pubdate":"2017-03-24T22:11:50+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Recent developments in the use of tyrosinase and laccase in environmental applications","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-developments-tyrosinase-laccase-environmental-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":4487471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2339215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248572,"mean":13.342049893189,"rank":141011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":84435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248572,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269,"mean":5.0733582089552,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.1071428571429,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
