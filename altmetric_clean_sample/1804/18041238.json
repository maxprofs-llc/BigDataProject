Are they ready to manage their health with new technology?"],"citation":{"abstract":"The Internet and eHealth technologies represent new opportunities for managing health. Age, sex, socioeconomic status, and current technology use are some of the known factors that influence individuals' uptake of eHealth; however, relatively little is known about facilitators and barriers to eHealth uptake specific to older adults, particularly as they relate to their experiences in accessing health care.\nThe aim of our study was to explore the interests, preferences, and concerns of older adults in using the Internet and eHealth technologies for managing their health in relation to their experiences with the current health care system.\nTwo focus groups (n=15) were conducted with adults aged 50+ years. Pragmatic thematic analysis using an inductive approach was conducted to identify the interests, preferences, and concerns of using the Internet and eHealth technologies.\nFive themes emerged that include (1) Difficulty in identifying credible and relevant sources of information on the Web; (2) Ownership, access, and responsibility for medical information; (3) Peer communication and support; (4) Opportunities to enhance health care interactions; and (5) Privacy concerns. These findings support the potential value older adults perceive in eHealth technologies, particularly in their ability to provide access to personal health information and facilitate communication between providers and peers living with similar conditions. However, in order to foster acceptance, these technologies will need to provide personal and general health information that is secure, readily accessible, and easily understood.\nOlder adults have diverse needs and preferences that, in part, are driven by their experiences and frustrations with the health care system. Results can help inform the design and implementation of technologies to address gaps in care and access to health information for older adults with chronic conditions who may benefit the most from this approach.","altmetric_jid":"521dffa83cf0582819000000","authors":["Patrick Ware","Susan J Bartlett","Guy Par\u00e9","Iphigenia Symeonidis","Cara Tannenbaum","Gillian Bartlett","Lise Poissant","Sara Ahmed"],"doi":"10.2196\/ijmr.4447","first_seen_on":"2017-03-23T17:00:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1929-073X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Interact J Med Res","last_mentioned_on":1493741313,"links":["http:\/\/www.i-jmr.org\/2017\/1\/e3\/","https:\/\/www.i-jmr.org\/2017\/1\/e3\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28336506?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=buffer0f9d9&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28336506?utm_content=buffer20cde&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"28336506","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada","title":"Using eHealth Technologies: Interests, Preferences, and Concerns of Older Adults","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-ehealth-technologies-interests-preferences-concerns-older-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.85,"score_history":{"1y":13.85,"6m":13.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161493,"mean":6.8965394462124,"rank":596476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7563171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161493,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238946,"mean":13.346720709786,"rank":30547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":208317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238946,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":4.1021904761905,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":14,"researcher":5,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":14,"Scientists":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
