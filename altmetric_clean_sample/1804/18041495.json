M. Kang, J. K. Lee et al."],"citation":{"abstract":"We demonstrated a systematic investigation on chemically functionalizable, non-biofouling agarose films over large-area glass surfaces. Agarose films, prepared with varying concentrations of agarose (aq), were activated by periodate oxidation to generate aldehyde groups at the termini of agarose chains. The non-biofouling efficacies and binding capabilities of the activated films were evaluated using protein and cellular patterning, assisted by a microarrayer, microcontact printing, and micromolding in capillaries. The characterization of a fluorescence slide scanner and a scanning probe microscopy revealed that the pore sizes of the agarose films played an important role in achieving desirable film performance: the 0.2 wt% agarose film exhibited the optimum efficacy in this work.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Han, Gyeongyeop","Hong, Daehwa","Lee, Bong Soo","Ha, EunRae","Park, Ji Hun","Choi, Insung S.","Kang, Sung Min","Lee, Jungkyu K."],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201700010","first_seen_on":"2017-03-23T17:12:27+00:00","issns":["18614728","1861-471X"],"journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1490316335,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201700010\/abstract;jsessionid=87AC06C39B243B5D543891ED6C87F37D.f04t01","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201700010?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201700010\/pdf","pmid":"28218479","pubdate":"2017-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Systematic Study of Functionalizable, Non-Biofouling Agarose Films with Protein and Cellular Patterns on Glass Slides","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/asia.201700010","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-study-functionalizable-nonbiofouling-agarose-films-protein-cellular-patterns-glass-slides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":6381729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1141406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248685,"mean":13.345632891541,"rank":178990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248685,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2559,"mean":1.3939624706802,"rank":942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2559,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":1.3046875,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemAsianJ\/statuses\/844959992633528322","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18041495],"posted_on":"2017-03-23T17:12:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Chem.
