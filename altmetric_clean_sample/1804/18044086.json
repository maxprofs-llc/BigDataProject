We discuss the role of prophylactic transfusions for specific indications like acute anemia and twin pregnancies. The management and prevention of vaso-occlusive crises and chest crisis are also outlined. The role of the multidisciplinary team cannot be overstated.Massive obstetric hemorrhage in this population is difficult, and unique considerations such as cell-saver technology and tranexamic acid usage are discussed. Secondary complications such as pulmonary hypertension and stroke are also considered, with a summary of the latest treatment guidelines.\nThis is a challenging cohort of pregnant patients who have a significantly increased morbidity and mortality. This review aims to aid management of these patients on the labor ward for both obstetric anesthetists and intensivists.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000585c","authors":["Vinod Patil","Gamunu Ratnayake","Galina Fastovets","Patil, Vinod","Ratnayake, Gamunu","Fastovets, Galina"],"doi":"10.1097\/aco.0000000000000464","first_seen_on":"2017-03-23T19:06:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0952-7907","1473-6500"],"issue":"3","journal":"Current opinion in anaesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1501759867,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28323673?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-anesthesiology\/Abstract\/2017\/06000\/Clinical__pearls__of_maternal_critical_care_Part.10.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-anesthesiology\/2017\/06000\/Clinical__pearls__of_maternal_critical_care_Part.10.pdf","pmid":"28323673","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"326","subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Clinical \u2018pearls\u2019 of maternal critical care Part 2","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/Insights.ovid.com\/crossref?an=00001503-900000000-99108","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-pearls-maternal-critical-care-part-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":6014250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2006154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246822,"mean":13.285767369875,"rank":163152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":69315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246822,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":849,"mean":2.3012523584906,"rank":503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":849,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.166,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
