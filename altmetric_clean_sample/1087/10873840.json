The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency and covariates of atrial septal aneurysm in adult patients undergoing transthoracic echocardiography in our outpatient clinic.\nFrom December 2011 to May 2016, 16,570 patients were included in the study. Records of patients were retrospectively analyzed from our previously established database. All cardiovascular examinations and echocardiographical examinations had been done during this period. Briefly, protrusion of interatrial septum more than 15mm into the right or left atrium with an at least 15mm diameter base of interatrial septum confirmed the diagnosis of atrial septal aneurysm.\nAtrial septal aneurysm has been documented in 393 patients (2.4%) in our study population. Mild to moderate mitral and aortic valve regurgitation have been demonstrated in 153 (39%) patients and in 61(16%) patients respectively. Sixty one (16%) of patients had the diagnosis of supraventricular arrhythmia of whom 52% underwent radiofrequency ablation procedure.\nIn conclusion we have documented that valvular regurgitation and supraventricular arrhythmias are common concurrent pathologies with atrial septal aneurysm.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b29","authors":["Yetkin, Ertan","Atalay, Hakan","Ileri, Mehmet"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijcard.2016.08.220","endpage":"659","first_seen_on":"2016-08-28T10:11:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1874-1754","01675273"],"journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1472379043,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27567234?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27567234","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"656","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Atrial septal aneurysm: Prevalence and covariates in adults","type":"article","volume":"223","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atrial-septal-aneurysm-prevalence-covariates-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":7168959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252203,"mean":12.462216691382,"rank":212132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252203,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3781,"mean":3.1951058201058,"rank":2538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3781,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":3.8605319148936,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CardiologiaF\/statuses\/769839621475827712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10873840],"posted_on":"2016-08-28T10:10:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiolog\u00eda-Fabumed","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1561758151\/fabumed_normal.png","description":"Cardiolog\u00eda.
