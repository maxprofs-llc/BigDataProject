Current studies have demonstrated that endoscopic stapes surgery is safe and has similar audiologic outcomes when compared with microscopic stapes procedures. However, preliminary studies show decreased postoperative pain in endoscopic cases compared with microscopic controls. In regards to possible endoscopic advantages, these few studies demonstrate mixed results when comparing the need to remove the bony medial external auditory canal wall to improve visualization and access to the oval window niche.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000841c","authors":["Hunter, Jacob B","Rivas, Alejandro"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.otc.2016.05.012","endpage":"1225","first_seen_on":"2016-08-28T18:39:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-8259","00306665"],"issue":"5","journal":"Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1472409550,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27565387?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27565387","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1215","subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Outcomes Following Endoscopic Stapes Surgery","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-following-endoscopic-stapes-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":7168854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252204,"mean":12.461895274838,"rank":212038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252204,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327,"mean":1.8965521472393,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.1888888888889,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/769967576306819072","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10878714],"posted_on":"2016-08-28T18:39:10+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"769967576306819072"}]}}
