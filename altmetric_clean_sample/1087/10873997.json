In this study, mean scores on self-reported complaints (measured with Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form; MMPI-2-RF) and cognitive performance (measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third edition; WAIS-III; and the California Verbal Learning Test; CVLT) are compared between two matched patient groups with severe (KS) and mild alcohol-related cognitive disorders or non KS (NKS). KS patients demonstrate significantly lower scores on the WAIS-III indices and on the CVLT than the matched NKS group, and significantly higher scores on MMPI-2-RF validity scales that indicate denial of psychological complaints. Both groups are in the normal range on MMPI-2-RF Cognitive Complaints (COG) and Neurological Complaints (NUC) scales compared with the normative sample. Finally, self-reported complaints and cognitive performance are not correlated significantly in both groups. Despite their alcohol-related cognitive impairments, both groups report no cognitive complaints at all indicating self-awareness impairment. In addition to KS patients, also NKS patients are at risk that their apparently \"without cognitive complaints\" appearance on self-report questionnaires can be easily overlooked. These findings may have important clinical implications for diagnostic and treatment purposes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Walvoort, Serge J W","van der Heijden, Paul T","Wester, Arie J","Kessels, Roy P C","Egger, Jos I M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.psychres.2016.08.007","endpage":"296","first_seen_on":"2016-08-28T10:24:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7123","01651781"],"journal":"Psychiatry Research","last_mentioned_on":1472379852,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27567191?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27567191","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"291","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Self-awareness of cognitive dysfunction: Self-reported complaints and cognitive performance in patients with alcohol-induced mild or major neurocognitive disorder","type":"article","volume":"245","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfawareness-cognitive-dysfunction-selfreported-complaints-cognitive-performance-patients-alcoholin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":7168928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252203,"mean":12.46218199697,"rank":212110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252203,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3847,"mean":4.6932574102964,"rank":3301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3847,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168,"mean":2.4396526946108,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
