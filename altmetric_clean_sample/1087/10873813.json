This process involves the products of the dltXABCD genes. These genes are widespread in Gram-positive bacteria and they are also found in a few Gram-negative bacteria. Notably, these genes are present in all soft rot Enterobacteria (Pectobacterium and Dickeya) whose genome has been sequenced in the dltDXBAC operon. We studied the function and the regulation of these genes in Dickeya dadantii dltB expression is induced in the presence of the AMP polymyxin. It is not regulated by PhoP, which controls the expression of some genes involved in AMP resistance, but by ArcA which has been identified as an activator of genes involved in AMP resistance. However, arcA is not the regulator responsible for polymyxin induction of these genes in this bacterium. This underlines the complexity of the mechanisms controlling AMP resistance in D. dadantii Two other genes involved in resistance to AMPs have also been characterized, phoS and phoH dltB, phoS, phoH and arcA but not dltD mutants were more sensitive to polymyxin than the wild type strain. Decreased fitness of the dltB, phoS and phoH mutants in chicory leaves indicates that their products are important for resistance to plant AMPs.\nGram-negative bacteria modify their LPS to resist AMPs. Soft rot Enterobacteria (Dickeya and Pectobacterium) possess homologues of the dlt genes in their genome which, in Gram-positive bacteria, are involved in resistance to AMPs. In this study, we show that these genes confer resistance to AMPs, probably by modifying LPS and that they are required for the fitness of the bacteria during plant infection. Two other new genes involved in resistance were also analyzed. These results show that bacterial resistance to AMPs can occur in bacteria through many different mechanisms that need to be characterized.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Pandin, Caroline","Caroff, Martine","Condemine, Guy"],"doi":"10.1128\/aem.01757-16","first_seen_on":"2016-08-28T10:09:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-5336","0099-2240"],"journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1472378977,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27565623?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27565623","pubdate":"2016-08-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"AEM.01757-16","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"\n              Identification and characterization of antimicrobial peptide resistance genes in the plant pathogen\n              Dickeya dadantii\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-characterization-antimicrobial-peptide-resistance-genes-plant-pathogen-idickeya-dadan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":4411424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2307755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252202,"mean":12.462274035392,"rank":139051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":87918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252202,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5737,"mean":6.7081565550907,"rank":3786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":1213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5737,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":34.372384615385,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Brianxbio\/statuses\/769839346581024768","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10873813],"posted_on":"2016-08-28T10:09:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Ho","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Brianxbio","tweeter_id":"215282928","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":54},"tweet_id":"769839346581024768"}]}}
