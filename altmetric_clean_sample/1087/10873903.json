Consecutive sampling included children from 6 to 14 years who needed allergy treatment for the first time. A structured questionnaire was carried out to collect demographic and clinical data and history of OAS. Besides sensitisation to various allergens, the skin prick-by-prick test was performed to corroborate sensitisation to food related to OAS. Prevalence of OAS and its association with pollens was established following the covariate adjusted logistic regression.\n267 subjects were included. Overall prevalence of OAS was 8.9% (95%CI 6.1-13.1%). Prevalence of OAS for allergic rhinitis and asthma were 8.8% and 9.1%, respectively. In patients sensitised to pollen, the prevalence ranged from 9.6% to 12.2% depending on the type of pollen. 62.5% of children with OAS were sensitive to pineapple. After adjusting for gender and family history of atopic disease, trees from the Quercus species showed an association with OAS (OR=2.7, 95%CI 1.2-6.2).\nOAS is not uncommon in our environment. Pineapple, a typical fruit from the region, was the main food related. Quercus sp., but not birch nor olive, was the pollen associated with this syndrome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006949","authors":["Bedolla-Barajas, M","Kestler-Gramajo, A","Alcal\u00e1-Padilla, G","Morales-Romero, J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aller.2016.04.017","first_seen_on":"2016-08-28T10:15:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1578-1267"],"journal":"Allergologia et Immunopathologia","last_mentioned_on":1472379325,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27567321?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27567321","pubdate":"2016-08-28T22:00:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Prevalence of oral allergy syndrome in children with allergic diseases.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-oral-allergy-syndrome-children-allergic-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":7168942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252202,"mean":12.462244297207,"rank":212121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252202,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":2.3065597964377,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.9277777777778,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
