Clinical characteristics were compared based on the stratification of HBeAg status and the presence of PC\/BCP mutations. In addition, subset analysis in HBeAg-positive cohort was performed to compare clinical features of patients with and without PC\/BCP mutations RESULTS:: Of the 267 patients enrolled from 3 centers, 177 were HBeAg positive and 90 HBeAg negative. When compared with HBeAg-negative patients, HBeAg-positive patients were significantly younger in mean age (37.93 vs. 44.40; P<0.001), had higher levels of median ALT (51 vs. 30.5 U\/mL; P<0.001), higher levels of mean HBV DNA (7.50\u00b11.48 vs. 5.10\u00b11.44 log10 copies\/mL; P<0.001), and lower frequency of detectable PC\/BCP mutations (60.45% vs. 93.33%; P<0.001), but had significantly higher frequency of BCP when mutations were detected (37.85% vs. 22.22%; P=0.013). Among HBeAg-positive patients, when compared with patients with wild type, those with PC\/BCP mutations were significantly older (30.63 vs. 42.71; P<0.001), had higher median ALT levels (29.5 vs. 73 U\/mL; P<0.001), but there was no significant association with mean HBV DNA levels (7.96 vs. 7.20 log10 copies\/mL; P=0.865) or HBV genotype (P=1.000). In the multivariate analysis, only age and ALT were independently associated with PC\/BCP mutations in HBeAg-positive patients, but there was no association with HBV genotype or DNA.\nPC\/BCP mutants were frequent (up to 60%) in treatment-naive HBeAg-positive patients and were associated with distinct clinical characteristics when compared with patients with wild type or HBeAg negative. Future large studies are needed to substantiate the long-term clinical outcomes when PC\/BCP mutations are detected in HBeAg-positive patients as it may impact the natural history or treatment response in such patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be5","authors":["Pan, Calvin Q.","Dai, Erhei","Bhamidimarri, Kalyan R.","Zeng, Zheng","Yin, Paley"],"doi":"10.1097\/mcg.0000000000000664","first_seen_on":"2016-08-28T18:33:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1539-2031","0192-0790"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1472409187,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcge\/9000\/00000\/Clinical_Features_of_Chronic_Hepatitis_B_in.98205.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcge\/9000\/00000\/Clinical_Features_of_Chronic_Hepatitis_B_in.98205.pdf","pmid":"27552328","pubdate":"2016-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Clinical Features of Chronic Hepatitis B in Treatment-naive Asian Patients With Positive HBeAg and Coexisting Precore and\/or Basal Core Promoter Mutations","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcge\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Clinical_Features_of_Chronic_Hepatitis_B_in.98205.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-features-chronic-hepatitis-b-treatmentnaive-asian-patients-positive-hbeag-coexisting-precor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":7168855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252204,"mean":12.461899239898,"rank":212039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252204,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1675,"mean":3.2559761051374,"rank":1407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1675,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":1.8245263157895,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JCGjournal\/statuses\/769966055544516608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10878668],"posted_on":"2016-08-28T18:33:07+00:00","author":{"name":"JCG Online","url":"http:\/\/www.jcge.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1090065440\/jcgcover_normal.jpg","description":"JCG gathers the world's latest, most relevant clinical studies and reviews, case reports, and technical expertise in a single source.","id_on_source":"JCGjournal","tweeter_id":"172068619","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":295},"tweet_id":"769966055544516608"}]}}
