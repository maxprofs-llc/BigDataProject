Increased water intake could help. A small trial shows modest benefit; however, a larger methodologically sound randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm efficacy.\nSpigt, M., Weerkamp, N., Troost, J., van Schayck, C. P., & Knottnerus, J. A. (2012). 'A randomized trial on the effects of regular water intake in patients with recurrent headaches.' Family practice, 29(4), 370-5. Doi: 10.1093\/fampra\/cmr112 CLINICAL SCENARIO: Patients from primary care registered as 'headache', 'tension headache' and\/or 'migraine' for more than one year who suffer at least two episodes of moderately intense headache or more than four mildly intense episodes of headache per month with a daily fluid intake of less than 2.5 litres per day.\nPatient\/Problem\u2009=\u2009Headache\u2009>\u20091 year with 2 moderately intense or 4 mildly intense episodes per month Intervention\u2009=\u20091.5 litres water per day\u2009+\u2009stress control and sleep hygiene Comparison\/Control\u2009=\u2009stress control and sleep hygiene Outcome\u2009=\u2009Reduce or eliminate headache Methodology\u2009=\u2009Therapy RCT Table 1: Final Search Terms TRIP Data Base: hits\u2009=\u2009517 used filter Extended Primary research 4 found 1 paper applicable 'Water intake '[MeSH Terms] AND 'Headache '[All Fields]' Best match to PICO, (2012) RCT SELECTION CRITERION AND OVERALL RESULTS: 102 headache patients in16 primary care clinics were randomized into control (n\u2009=\u200950) and intervention groups (n\u2009=\u200952) Inclusion criteria\u2009=\u2009two\u2009>\u2009episodes of moderately intense headache or five\u2009>\u2009mildly intense headaches per month and total fluid intake\u2009>\u20092.5 litres per day, Follow-up @ 3 months. 79% intervention and 66% of controls completed RCT. Drinking more water resulted in a statistically significant improvement of 4.5 (confidence interval: 1.3-7.8) points on Migraine-Specific Quality of Life (MSQOL). 47% in the intervention (water) group self-reported improvement (6\u2009>\u2009on a 10-point scale) against 25% in controls. Drinking water did not reduce headache days.\nThe transparency from the author of this critically appraised paper enables others to use this study as a teaching tool and to learn from the shortcomings in the trial. The study was underpowered and contains methodological shortcomings. Participants were partially un-blinded during the trial increasing the risk for bias. Only the subjective measures are statistically significant and attrition was significant. The intervention is low risk and of negligible cost. A methodologically sound RCT is recommended to evaluate if the intervention has beneficial effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f33cf058f610002d91","authors":["Price, Amy","Burls, Amanda"],"doi":"10.1111\/jep.12413","endpage":"1218","first_seen_on":"2015-07-23T10:05:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2753"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice","last_mentioned_on":1437901620,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26200171?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jep.12413"],"pmid":"26200171","pubdate":"2015-07-23T22:00:44+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1212","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Increased water intake to reduce headache: learning from a critical appraisal","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-water-intake-reduce-headache-learning-critical-appraisal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.492,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.492},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5402352,"mean":6.3008881422194,"rank":752352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4650049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5402352,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189791,"mean":8.6557413246221,"rank":35441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":154350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189791,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":505,"mean":6.2359722222222,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":505,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":6.1655172413793,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
