There are conflicting reports as to their fate in HIV infection. The objective of this study was to determine whether MAIT cells are truly depleted in HIV infection.In this case-control study of HIV-positive patients and healthy controls, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the abundance of messenger RNA (mRNA) and genomic DNA (gDNA) encoding the canonical MAIT cell T cell receptor (V\u03b17.2-J\u03b133). Comparison was made with flow cytometry.Significant depletion of both V\u03b17.2-J\u03b133 mRNA and gDNA was seen in HIV infection. Depletion of V\u03b17.2+CD161++ T cells was confirmed by flow cytometry. In HIV infection, the abundance of V\u03b17.2-J\u03b133 mRNA correlated most strongly with the frequency of V\u03b17.2+CD161++ cells. No increase was observed in the frequency of V\u03b17.2+CD161- cells among CD3+CD4- lymphocytes.MAIT cells are depleted from blood in HIV infection as confirmed by independent assays. Significant accumulation of a CD161- MAIT cell population is unlikely. Molecular approaches represent a suitable alternative to flow cytometry-based assays for tracking of MAIT cells in HIV and other settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Ussher, James E","Phalora, Prabhjeet","Cosgrove, Cormac","Hannaway, Rachel F","Rauch, Andri","G\u00fcnthard, Huldrych F","Goulder, Philip","Phillips, Rodney E","Willberg, Christian B","Klenerman, Paul"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000001134","first_seen_on":"2015-07-23T10:25:27+00:00","funders":["niehs","wellcome"],"issns":["1536-5964","0025-7974"],"issue":"29","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1445434654,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26200614?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2015\/07040\/Molecular_Analyses_Define_V_7_2_J_33__MAIT_Cell.6.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2015\/07040\/Molecular_Analyses_Define_V_7_2_J_33__MAIT_Cell.6.aspx?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26200614?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26200614","pubdate":"2015-07-23T22:00:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e1134","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Molecular Analyses Define V\u03b17.2-J\u03b133+ MAIT Cell Depletion in HIV Infection: A Case-Control Study.","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-analyses-define-v%CE%B172j%CE%B133-mait-cell-depletion-hiv-infection-casecontrol-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6356958,"mean":5.9827593932131,"rank":2800465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3387297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6356958,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184138,"mean":8.8623979319747,"rank":90318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":85828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184138,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3194,"mean":2.3123344816787,"rank":978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3194,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276,"mean":1.7505090909091,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
