Giv-61L homologues were found only in the genus Ranavirus. Three mAbs to Giv-61L protein were produced. In drug inhibition assays, giv-61L was identified as a late gene. Finally, GIV-61L-mAb-8 was used in western blotting and immunofluorescence assays to demonstrate that Giv-61L protein was included in the GIV particle, expressed at 18\u2009h, and localized only in the cytoplasm of GIV-infected cells. The results of this study provide insight into GIV pathogenesis and GIV-61L-mAbs will have broad applications in GIV immunodiagnostics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002da9","authors":["Chen, Z.\u2010Y.","Hsieh, W.\u2010Y.","Lai, Y.\u2010S.","Chen, Z-Y","Hsieh, W-Y","Lai, Y-S"],"doi":"10.1111\/jfb.12728","endpage":"399","first_seen_on":"2015-07-21T12:56:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1095-8649"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Fish Biology","last_mentioned_on":1437483352,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jfb.12728\/abstract;jsessionid=33DFE32DE99EA27FF49F8886703DCD51.f04t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111%2Fjfb.12728#.Va5BMCzNDHw.twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jfb.12728"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jfb.12728\/pdf","pmid":"26180031","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"386","title":"Identification and characterization of a late gene of grouper iridovirus 61l and antibody production against the protein encoded by it","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-characterization-late-gene-grouper-iridovirus-61l-antibody-production-against-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6403272,"mean":5.9845913437054,"rank":4499369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1670869,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6403272,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189307,"mean":8.7157807042566,"rank":121713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":58646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189307,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1204,"mean":3.7402443890274,"rank":737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1204,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.2931818181818,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
