In the proposed structure, the active layer is formed from an amorphous silicon thin film sandwiched between silicon nanowires from above and photonic crystal structures from below. The upper electrical contact consists of an indium tin oxide layer, which serves also as an antireflection coating. A metal backreflector works additionally as the other contact. The simulation was done using a new reliable, efficient and generic optoelectronic approach. The suggested multiscale simulation model integrates the finite-difference time-domain algorithm used in solving Maxwell's equation in three dimensions with a commercial simulation platform based on the finite element method for carrier transport modeling. The absorption profile, the external quantum efficient, and the power conversion efficiency of the suggested solar cell are calculated. A noticeable enhancement is found in all the characteristics of the novel structure with an estimated 32% increase in the total conversion efficiency over a cell without any light trapping mechanisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5693cf058f610004b13","authors":["Abdellatif, S","Kirah, K","Ghannam, R","Khalil, A S G","Anis, W"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-21T12:44:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1539-4522"],"issue":"17","journal":"Applied Optics","last_mentioned_on":1437482643,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26192857?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26192857","pubdate":"2015-07-21T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Enhancing the absorption capabilities of thin-film solar cells using sandwiched light trapping structures.","type":"article","volume":"54"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5382699,"mean":6.2882651740817,"rank":4478407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5382699,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189427,"mean":8.6294547844542,"rank":152290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189427,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":753,"mean":5.5015,"rank":604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":753,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/status\/623473512716435456","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4300068],"posted_on":"2015-07-21T12:44:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
