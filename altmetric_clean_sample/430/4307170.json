However, there are concerns over propofol's reliability in targeting moderate sedation during more complex and lengthy procedures, such as endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy. Its delivery by continuous infusion, which provides a steady sedation effect, may be a practical model for achieving reliable outcomes in this setting.\nWe tested a continuous propofol infusion protocol targeting moderate sedation for EBUS bronchoscopy. A fixed loading rate of 125 mcg\/kg\/min and initial maintenance rate of 75 mcg\/kg\/min were used. Sedation assessments were performed every 2.5 minutes. The infusion was adjusted by a nurse under the direction of the bronchoscopist to maintain moderate sedation, normal vital signs, and patient comfort. Prospectively collected data from the first 31 patients using the protocol were analyzed.\nA mix of EBUS types was performed in a fellowship training environment. Median procedure duration was 51 minutes (interquartile range, 41 to 75 min). Ninety-four percent of total bronchoscopy time was spent in moderate sedation, whereas only 1.9% was occupied by agitation-related delays. Average propofol dose per case was 0.07 mg\/kg\/min (\u00b10.020), and infusion adjustments were required once every 8 minutes. Sampling goals were met in all patients, and diagnostic and nodal staging accuracies were 90% and 91%, respectively. All tumor specimens sent for genetics were sufficient for analysis. There were no major procedure-related complications.\nBronchoscopist-directed continuous propofol infusion is effective and practical for reliably and safely targeting moderate sedation during EBUS bronchoscopy, without sacrificing the breadth and accuracy of the procedure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bab","authors":["Chrissian, Ara A","Bedi,
