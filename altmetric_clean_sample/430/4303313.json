It is difficult to assess the entire contained self-reactive peripheral T cell repertoire in healthy individuals because regulatory T cells (Tregs) can render these cells anergic and, therefore, functionally indistinguishable. We addressed this issue by removing regulatory T cells, thereby allowing us to characterize the exposed self-reactive T cells. This resulted in activation of approximately 4% of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Activation and division of these cells was not a bystander product of Ag-independent signals but required TCR stimulation. Analysis of TCR sequences showed that these responding cells were polyclonal and encompassed a broad range of structural TCR diversity. Adoptive transfer of naive and effector\/memory T cell populations showed that even the naive T cell pool contained self-reactive T cell precursors. In addition, transfer of mature thymocytes showed that this response was an intrinsic T cell property rather than a peripheral adaptation. Finally, we found that the unexpectedly strong contribution of the naive CD5(low) T cell pool showed that the overall self-reactive response has not only a diverse polyclonal TCR repertoire, but also comprises a broad range of affinities for self.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Richards, David M","Ruggiero, Eliana","Hofer, Ann-Cathrin","Sefrin, Julian P","Schmidt, Manfred","von Kalle, Christof","Feuerer, Markus","Richards, David M.","Sefrin, Julian P."],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1500880","first_seen_on":"2015-07-22T13:01:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1550-6606","0022-1767"],"journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1450379402,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26195815?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/195\/5\/2067.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26195815","pubdate":"2015-07-22T22:01:10+00:00","publisher":"The American Association of Immunologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The Contained Self-Reactive Peripheral T Cell Repertoire: Size, Diversity, and Cellular Composition","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contained-selfreactive-peripheral-t-cell-repertoire-size-diversity-cellular-composition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992147,"mean":6.7405564850737,"rank":3723769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4089087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992147,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230191,"mean":8.2620522872411,"rank":101115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":120652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230191,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6871,"mean":2.8192154294032,"rank":3136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":3372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6871,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":2.6679827586207,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
