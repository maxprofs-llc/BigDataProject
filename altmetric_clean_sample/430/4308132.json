The ability of S. mutans to cope with such threats is crucial for its survival and persistence in dental biofilms. By screening a transposon mutant library, we identified 11 transposon insertion mutants that are sensitive to bacitracin. Two of these mutants, XTn-01 and XTn-03, had an independent insertion in the same locus, SMU.244, which encodes a homologue of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase or UppP. In this study, we describe genetic and phenotypic characterizations of SMU.244 in antibiotic resistance. The results reveal that deletion of SMU.244 results in a mutant (XT\u0394244) that is highly sensitive to bacitracin but confers more resistance to lactococcin G, a class IIb bacteriocin. Introduction of the intact SMU.244 into XT\u0394244 in trans completely restores its resistance to bacitracin and the susceptibility to lactococcin G. The XT\u0394244 is also defective in forming the wild type biofilm, although its growth is not significantly affected. Using recombinant protein technology, we demonstrate that SMU.244-encoded protein displays an enzyme activity of catalyzing dephosphorylation of the substrate. The lux transcriptional reporter assays show that S. mutans maintains a moderate level of expression of SMU.244 in the absence of bacitracin, but bacitracin at a sub-MIC can further induce its expression. We conclude that SMU.244 encodes an UppP protein that plays important roles in the cell wall biosynthesis and bacitracin resistance in S. mutans.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004208","authors":["Jalal, Naif","Tian, Xiao-Lin","Dong, Gaofeng","Upham, Jacqueline","Chen, Chao","Parcells, Madison","Li, Yung-Hua"],"doi":"10.1099\/mic.0.000142","first_seen_on":"2015-07-23T10:15:48+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1465-2080","1350-0872"],"issue":"9","journal":"Microbiology (13500872)","last_mentioned_on":1467454691,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26198853?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/mic.sgmjournals.org\/content\/view.action?itemId=http%3A%2F%2Fsgm.metastore.ingenta.com%2Fcontent%2Fjournal%2Fmicro%2F10.1099%2Fmic.0.000142&itemType=http%3A%2F%2Fpub2web.metastore.ingenta.com%2Fns%2FFastTrackArticleProxy&view="],"pmid":"26198853","pubdate":"2015-07-23T22:01:41+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Identification and Characterizations of SMU.244 Encoding A Putative UppP Protein Required for the Cell Wall Biosynthesis and Bacitracin Resistance in Streptococcus mutans","type":"article","volume":"161","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-characterization-smu244-encoding-putative-undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate-phosphatase-prot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":3956538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3816245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229060,"mean":8.2967359588578,"rank":111158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":108265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229060,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1079,"mean":2.9926419294991,"rank":612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1079,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":2.5314814814815,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/status\/624160935993716736","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4308132],"posted_on":"2015-07-23T10:15:38+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
