Here we show that such interactions rule the thermal cis-trans isomerization kinetics, towards a better control on the azobenzene bistability for its optimal integration as a responsive material.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823d","authors":["Corinna Raimondo","Bart Kenens","Federica Reinders","Marcel Mayor","Hiroshi Uji-i","P.
