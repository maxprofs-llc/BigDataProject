Based on ethnographic research amongst Somali women in Johannesburg and Nairobi, we argue that the context of forced migration provides women with opportunities to renegotiate and reinvent what female circumcision means to them. The complex, subjective and diverse perceptions and experiences of circumcision as embedded processes, within the context of migration, we argue has been overlooked in the literature, which has tended to be framed within a normative discourse concerned with the medical effects of the practice, or in anthropological studies, counter to the normative discourse based on personal narratives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f610001420","authors":["Zaheera Jinnah","Lucy Lowe"],"doi":"10.1080\/01459740.2015.1045140","endpage":"388","first_seen_on":"2015-07-23T08:28:38+00:00","issns":["1545-5882","0145-9740"],"issue":"4","journal":"Medical Anthropology","last_mentioned_on":1438802557,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/01459740.2015.1045140","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/01459740.2015.1045140?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/01459740.2015.1045140?journalCode=gmea20&"],"pmid":"26076054","pubdate":"2015-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"371","subjects":["anthropology","socialsciences"],"title":"Circumcising Circumcision: Renegotiating Beliefs and Practices among Somali Women in Johannesburg and Nairobi","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/01459740.2015.1045140","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circumcising-circumcision-renegotiating-beliefs-practices-among-somali-women-johannesburg-nairobi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446629,"mean":6.3432151099742,"rank":382578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":5059146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446629,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190407,"mean":8.6619054546601,"rank":20092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":170139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190407,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205,"mean":6.2786274509804,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":8.231,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
