Our study aimed to explore the presence of T6SS in C. jejuni (n\u00a0=\u00a059) and C. coli (n\u00a0=\u00a057) isolates, from retail raw chicken and to investigate their pathogenic potential. The hcp gene was used as an indicator for the T6SS presence.\nUsing multiplex PCR we have identified a significantly higher prevalence of hcp in C. coli isolates (56.1%) than in C. jejuni (28.8%) and AFLP analysis of the isolates showed a high degree of genetic similarity between the isolates carrying the hcp gene. Genome sequencing data showed that 84.3% of the C. coli and 93.7% of the C. jejuni isolates had all 13 T6SS open reading frames. Moreover, the virulence characteristics of hcp\u00a0+\u00a0isolates, including motility and the ability to invade human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, were significantly greater than in the control strain C. jejuni 12502; a human isolate which is hcp positive.\nOverall, it was discovered that hcp (+) C. coli and C. jejuni isolated from retail chicken isolates posses genetic and phenotypic properties associated with enhanced virulence. However, since human infections with C. coli are significantly less frequent than those of C. jejuni, the relationship between virulence factors and pathogenesis requires further study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000827","authors":["Nicolae Corcionivoschi","Ozan Gundogdu","Lynn Moran","Carmel Kelly","Pam Scates","Lavinia Stef","Ada Cean","Brendan Wren","Nick Dorrell","Robert H Madden"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13099-015-0067-z","first_seen_on":"2015-07-23T12:32:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-4749"],"journal":"Gut Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1437735185,"links":["http:\/\/www.gutpathogens.com\/content\/7\/1\/20"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.gutpathogens.com\/content\/pdf\/s13099-015-0067-z.pdf","pmid":"26207145","pubdate":"2015-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Virulence characteristics of hcp + Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates from retail chicken","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/virulence-characteristics-hcp-campylobacter-jejuni-campylobacter-coli-isolates-retail-chicken"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5395569,"mean":6.2971090647005,"rank":1329615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":4053027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5395569,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189679,"mean":8.6565773574164,"rank":57898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":131148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189679,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":5.613417721519,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.8388888888889,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
