We hypothesised that low-concentration, preservative-free, pH-balanced agents would be less toxic than high-concentration non-pH-balanced agents with preservatives, and that injections of individual agents are less toxic than combined injections. The left knees of 12- to 13-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were injected once with eight different single agents, including low and high concentrations of ropivacaine and triamcinolone, alone and in combination, as well as negative and positive controls. The rats were killed at one week or five months, and live-dead staining was performed to quantify the death of chondrocytes. All injections except pH-balanced 0.2% ropivacaine combined with preservative-free 1 mg\/ml triamcinolone acetonide resulted in statistically significant decreases in chondrocyte viability, compared with control knees, after one week and five months (p < 0.001). After one week there was no significant difference in viability between 0.2% and 0.5% ropivacaine; however, 4 mg\/ml triamcinolone resulted in a lower viability than 1 mg\/ml triamcinolone. Although many agents commonly injected into joints are chondrotoxic, in this in vivo study diluting preservative-free 10 mg\/ml triamcinolone 1:9 in 0.2% pH-balanced ropivacaine resulted in low toxicity.
