She was referred to our hospital at 42\u2005weeks of gestation with breathlessness and oligohydramnios. She had worked in a glass and talc powder factory for 11\u2005years and was diagnosed as having silicosis 2\u2005years prior; she was on treatment. Following admission, she was evaluated for dyspnoea and underwent emergency Caesarean section for poor cervical dilation. She developed a burst abdomen on the third postoperative day with loops of gangrenous bowel protruding outside the abdomen. Emergency laparotomy with ileal resection and ileostomy was carried out. She was discharged on day 14 and is on follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of silicosis in pregnancy presenting with an unusual complication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Sivabalasubramaniam, Gajatheepan","Sagili, Haritha","Dasari, Papa","Gowda, Mamatha"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2014-207132","first_seen_on":"2015-07-22T18:11:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1437588666,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26109620"],"pmid":"26109620","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Burst abdomen: an unusual complication of silicosis in pregnancy.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/burst-abdomen-unusual-complication-silicosis-pregnancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5387941,"mean":6.2928660898247,"rank":3791111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":905345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5387941,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190081,"mean":8.6320959490742,"rank":131882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190081,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2556,"mean":3.7186598825832,"rank":1486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2556,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":3.4832835820896,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/eiNetMN\/status\/623918204146978816","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4305812],"posted_on":"2015-07-22T18:11:06+00:00","author":{"name":"ei Network Minnesota","url":"http:\/\/mnenvironmentalillnessnetwork.tumblr.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1787687716\/bird_on_two_colors_normal.jpeg","description":"Environmental Illness Network Minnesota is a community for environmentally sensitive Minnesotans and those who care about them.
