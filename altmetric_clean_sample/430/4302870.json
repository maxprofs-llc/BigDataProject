MRC-5 fibroblasts are one of the CAFs expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin. It is ascertained that medium conditioned by MRC-5 fibroblasts stimulate motility and invasion of breast cancer cells. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is less clear. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of MRC-5-CM on HCC and explore the underlying mechanisms.\nUsing a combination of techniques, the role of MRC-5-CM in HCC was evaluated. We determined that MRC-5-CM induced the non-classical EMT in Bel-7402 and MHCC-LM3 cell lines. Initiation of the non-classical EMT was mainly via quintessential redistribution of \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-catenin, P120 catenin, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin, rather than up-regulation of typical EMT-related transcription factors (i.e., Snail, Twist1, ZEB-1 and ZEB2). We also found that MRC-5-CM potentiated both the migration and invasion of Bel-7402 and MHCC-LM3 cells in mesenchymal movement mode through activation of the \u03b16, \u03b23, \u03b24, \u03b27 integrin\/FAK pathway and upregulation of MMP2. The flow cytometric analysis showed that MRC-5-CM induced G1 phase arrest in Bel-7402 cells with a concomitant reduction of S phase cells. In contrast, MRC-5-CM induced S phase arrest in MHCC-LM3 cells with a concomitant reduction of cells in the G2\/M phase. MRC-5-CM also inhibited apoptosis in Bel-7402 cells while inducing apoptosis in MHCC-LM3 cells.\nCollectively, MRC-5-CM promoted HCC cell motility and invasiveness through initiation of the non-classical EMT, including redistribution of \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-catenin, P120 catenin, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin, activation of the integrin\/FAK pathway, and upregulation of MMP2. Hence, MRC-5-CM exerted distinct roles in Bel-7402 and MHCC-LM3 cell viability by regulating cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), CDK inhibitors (CKIs), Bcl-2 family proteins and other unknown mechanosensors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","authors":["Songming Ding","Guoliang Chen","Wu Zhang","Chunyang Xing","Xiao Xu","Haiyang Xie","Aili Lu","Kangjie Chen","Haijun Guo","Zhigang Ren","Shusen Zheng","Lin Zhou"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12967-015-0588-8","first_seen_on":"2015-07-22T03:37:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1479-5876"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1464173831,"links":["http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/13\/1\/237","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26198300?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/pdf\/s12967-015-0588-8.pdf","pmid":"26198300","pubdate":"2015-07-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"MRC-5 fibroblast-conditioned medium influences multiple pathways regulating invasion, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mrc5-fibroblastconditioned-medium-influences-multiple-pathways-regulating-invasion-migration-prolife"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7757128,"mean":6.6329627680391,"rank":4030877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2177375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7757128,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228804,"mean":8.2326106912935,"rank":121505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":84521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228804,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1762,"mean":5.4217206132879,"rank":992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1762,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":2.6515384615385,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
