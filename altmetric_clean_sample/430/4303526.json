The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of combined orthognathic surgeries, together with guiding templates and splints fabricated by rapid prototyping technique, for the correction of facial asymmetry. Fourteen patients with facial asymmetry associated with vertical maxillary excess and mandibular prognathism were included. A maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy, a sagittal split ramus osteotomy on the shorter side of the face, and an intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy on the longer side of the face were performed with the aid of guiding templates and splints fabricated by rapid prototyping technique. Parameters reflecting maxillary canting, ramal inclination, mandibular deviation, and chin inclination were measured before surgery, 7 days after surgery, and 1 year after surgery, and compared. Significant differences in these parameters were found between the two sides preoperatively, whereas no differences were observed postoperatively. Facial asymmetry was corrected in all patients with satisfactory outcomes. In conclusion, combined orthognathic surgery and guiding templates and splints can offer improvements in accuracy, complexity, and duration over traditional procedures for the correction of facial asymmetry associated with vertical maxillary excess and mandibular prognathism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f54","authors":["Ying, B","Ye, N","Jiang, Y","Liu, Y","Hu, J","Zhu, S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijom.2015.05.012","first_seen_on":"2015-07-22T13:11:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1399-0020"],"journal":"International Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1437570669,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26194772"],"pmid":"26194772","pubdate":"2015-07-22T22:01:47+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Correction of facial asymmetry associated with vertical maxillary excess and mandibular prognathism by combined orthognathic surgery and guiding templates and splints fabricated by rapid prototyping technique.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correction-facial-asymmetry-associated-vertical-maxillary-excess-mandibular-prognathism-combined-ort"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5387056,"mean":6.2931795012321,"rank":4481855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5387056,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190075,"mean":8.6323402885193,"rank":152689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190075,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":447,"mean":1.6718385650224,"rank":361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":447,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.55833333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
