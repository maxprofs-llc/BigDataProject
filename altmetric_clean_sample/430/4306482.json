A weak intra-molecular C-H\u22efO inter-action is observed. In the crystal, C-H\u22efO, S-H\u22efN and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking inter-actions between the fused benzene ring of quinoline and the pyridine moieties [shortest centroid-centroid distance = 3.6754\u2005(11)\u2005\u00c5] are observed. Inversion-related weak C-H\u22efO inter-molecular inter-actions diagonally along [010], with R 2 (2)(10) ring motifs, and S-H\u22efN inter-molecular inter-actions diagonally along [100], with R 2 (2)(8) ring motifs, are present, forming a three-dimensional network structure. No classical hydrogen bonds are observed.","authors":["Rihanabanu"],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989015013596","first_seen_on":"2015-07-23T00:00:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"Pt 8","journal":"Acta crystallographica.
