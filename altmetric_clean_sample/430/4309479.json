Its precursor in the sterol biosynthetic pathway, lanosterol, has been argued by Konrad Bloch (Bloch, K. 1965. Science. 150:19-28; 1983. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 14:47-92; 1994. Blonds in Venetian Paintings, the Nine-Banded Armadillo, and Other Essays in Biochemistry. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT.) to also be a precursor in the molecular evolution of cholesterol. We present a comparative study of the effects of cholesterol and lanosterol on molecular conformational order and phase equilibria of lipid-bilayer membranes. By using deuterium NMR spectroscopy on multilamellar lipid-sterol systems in combination with Monte Carlo simulations of microscopic models of lipid-sterol interactions, we demonstrate that the evolution in the molecular chemistry from lanosterol to cholesterol is manifested in the model lipid-sterol membranes by an increase in the ability of the sterols to promote and stabilize a particular membrane phase, the liquid-ordered phase, and to induce collective order in the acyl-chain conformations of lipid molecules. We also discuss the biological relevance of our results, in particular in the context of membrane domains and rafts.","ads_id":"2002BpJ....82.1429M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["Ling Miao","Morten Nielsen","Jenifer Thewalt","John H Ipsen","Myer Bloom","Martin J Zuckermann","Ole G Mouritsen","Miao, Ling","Nielsen, Morten","Thewalt, Jenifer","Ipsen, John H","Bloom, Myer","Zuckermann, Martin J","Mouritsen, Ole G","John H.
