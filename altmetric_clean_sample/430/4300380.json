To reduce this high mortality rate, more sensitive diagnostic tools allowing an early stage medical imaging of even very small tumours are needed. For this purpose, magnetic, biodegradable nanoparticles prepared using recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) and incorporated iron oxide (maghemite, \u03b3-Fe2O3) nanoparticles were developed. Galectin-1 has been chosen as target receptor as this protein is upregulated in pancreatic cancer and its precursor lesions but not in healthy pancreatic tissue nor in pancreatitis. Tissue plasminogen activator derived peptides (t-PA-ligands), that have a high affinity to galectin-1 have been chosen as target moieties and were covalently attached onto the nanoparticle surface. Improved targeting and imaging properties were shown in mice using single photon emission computed tomography-computer tomography (SPECT-CT), a handheld gamma camera, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d37","authors":["Rosenberger, I","Strauss, A","Dobiasch, S","Weis, C","Szanyi, S","Gil-Iceta, L","Alonso, E","Gonz\u00e1lez Esparza, M","G\u00f3mez-Vallejo, V","Szczupak, B","Plaza-Garc\u00eda, S","Mirzaei, S","Israel, L L","Bianchessi, S","Scanziani, E","Lellouche, J-P","Knoll, P","Werner, J","Felix, K","Grenacher, L","Reese, T","Kreuter, J","Jim\u00e9nez-Gonz\u00e1lez, M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jconrel.2015.07.017","first_seen_on":"2015-07-21T14:03:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01683659","1873-4995"],"journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","last_mentioned_on":1444205906,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168365915300304"],"pmid":"26192099","pubdate":"2015-07-21T22:00:30+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Targeted diagnostic magnetic nanoparticles for medical imaging of pancreatic cancer ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeted-diagnostic-magnetic-nanoparticles-medical-imaging-pancreatic-cancer-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6258798,"mean":5.9551517264437,"rank":1310205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":4925203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6258798,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183662,"mean":8.8105267966526,"rank":52463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":130480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183662,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2309,"mean":2.4526169844021,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2309,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":1.7485794392523,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
