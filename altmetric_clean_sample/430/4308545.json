The discovery phase included 833 Caucasian cases and 739 Caucasian controls, and used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with gene-asbestos interaction effects. The top ranked SNPs from the discovery phase were replicated within the International Lung and Cancer Consortium (ILCCO). First, in silico replication was conducted in those groups that had GWAS and asbestos exposure data, including 1,548 cases and 1,527 controls. This step was followed by de novo genotyping to replicate the results from the in silico replication, and included 1,539 cases and 1,761 controls. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the SNP-asbestos exposure interaction effects on lung cancer risk.\nWe observed significantly increased lung cancer risk among MIRLET7BHG (MIRLET7B host gene at 22q13.31) polymorphisms rs13053856, rs11090910, rs11703832, and rs12170325 variant allele(s) carriers [p<5\u00d710-7 by likelihood ratio test; df=1]. Among the variant allele(s) carriers of rs13053856, rs11090910, rs11703832, and rs12170325, each unit increase in the natural log-transformed asbestos exposure score was associated with age-, sex-, smoking status- and center-adjusted ORs of 1.34(95%CI=1.18-1.51), 1.24(95%CI=1.14-1.35), 1.28(95%CI=1.17-1.40), and 1.26(95%CI=1.15-1.38), respectively for lung cancer risk.\nMIRLET7BHG polymorphisms may be important predictive markers for asbestos exposure-related lung cancer.\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first report using a systematic genome-wide analysis in combination with detailed asbestos exposure data and replication to evaluate asbestos-associated lung cancer risk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dcc","authors":["Liu, Chen-Yu","Stucker, Isabelle","Chen, Chu","Goodman,
