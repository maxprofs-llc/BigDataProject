The underlying mechanisms are ill defined. Here we show that shortly after birth, CD4 T cells populate preformed lymphoid structures in the small intestine and quickly acquire a distinct transcriptional profile. T-cell recruitment is independent of microbial colonization and innate or adaptive immune stimulation but requires \u03b27 integrin expression. Surprisingly, neonatal CD4 T cells remain immature throughout the postnatal period under homeostatic conditions but undergo maturation and gain effector function on barrier disruption. Maternal SIgA and regulatory T cells act in concert to prevent immune stimulation and maintain the immature phenotype of CD4 T cells in the postnatal intestine during homeostasis. Active suppression of CD4 T-cell maturation during the postnatal period might contribute to prevent auto-reactivity, sustain a broad TCR repertoire and establish life-long immune homeostasis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Natalia Torow","Natalia Torow","Kai Yu","Kasra Hassani","Jenny Freitag","Olga Schulz","Marijana Basic","Anne Brennecke","Tim Sparwasser","Norbert Wagner","Andr\u00e9 Bleich","Matthias Lochner","Siegfried Weiss","Reinhold F\u00f6rster","Oliver Pabst","Mathias W.
