The focus is on practical aspects of E-R analyses to assist modeling scientists with a process of performing such analyses in a consistent manner across individuals and projects and tailored to typical clinical drug development decisions. This includes general considerations for planning, conducting, and visualizing E-R analyses, and how these are linked to key questions.","altmetric_jid":"54f07f832a83eea16c8b456a","authors":["Overgaard, R.V.","Ingwersen, S.H.","Torn\u00f8e, C.W.","Overgaard, RV","Ingwersen, SH","Torn\u00f8e, CW"],"doi":"10.1002\/psp4.12015","endpage":"575","first_seen_on":"2015-07-22T19:57:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2163-8306"],"issue":"10","journal":"CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1437595023,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/psp4.12015\/pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/psp4.12015\/pdf","pmid":"26535157","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"565","title":"Tutorial.
