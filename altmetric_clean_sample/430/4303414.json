The Aboriginal Children's Health and Well-being Measure (ACHWM) was developed to enable Aboriginal communities to obtain group-level data from the perspectives of their children 8 to 18\u00a0years of age. The survey was developed in collaboration with children, based on the Medicine Wheel framework. The purpose of this study was to ensure that children and youth interpreted the ACHWM questions consistently and accurately and to establish the face validity of the survey.\nChildren and parents\/caregivers from the Wikwemikong Unceded Indian Reserve (Canada) participated in a detailed interview process as they completed the ACHWM, in 2012. Each participant worked through their thought process verbally, to enable the interviewer to identify questions that were misinterpreted or inconsistently interpreted. Questions were revised based on feedback from the participants, and reviewed with new participants until a stable version was established. The resulting version was reviewed by health care providers and community members to further ensure cultural relevance and face validity within the community.\nA total of 18 interviews, with 9 children and 9 caregivers, were required to achieve a stable version of the survey. The children ranged in age from 8 to 18\u00a0years. Revisions were required for 19 questions. Most of these revisions were minor linguistic changes. In addition, 6 questions were deleted due to consistent problems and 4 questions were created to address gaps identified during the process. Community members confirmed the appropriateness of the measure for their community and communicated their pride in their youth's role in the development of this survey.\nThe result was a 58-question version of the ACHWM that was consistently interpreted and culturally appropriate, and had face validity confirmed by experts from the community, children and their parents\/caregivers. The ACHWM is ready to be assessed for relevance to other Aboriginal communities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000082d","authors":["Nancy L Young","Mary J Wabano","Stephen D Ritchie","Tricia A Burke","Brenda Pangowish","Rita G Corbiere"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12955-015-0296-3","first_seen_on":"2015-07-22T13:04:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-7525"],"issue":"1","journal":"Health and Quality of Life Outcomes","last_mentioned_on":1442937135,"links":["http:\/\/www.hqlo.com\/content\/13\/1\/105","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4511023\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4511023\/pdf\/12955_2015_Article_296.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.hqlo.com\/content\/pdf\/s12955-015-0296-3.pdf","pmid":"26197841","pubdate":"2015-07-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quality of Life Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Assessing children\u2019s interpretations of the Aboriginal Children\u2019s Health and Well-Being Measure (ACHWM)","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessing-childrens-interpretations-aboriginal-childrens-health-wellbeing-measure-achwm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7457423,"mean":6.4778058835843,"rank":3292104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4092330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7457423,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227082,"mean":8.165834622888,"rank":93338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":129331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227082,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":853,"mean":2.3457183098592,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":853,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":2.1582903225806,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
