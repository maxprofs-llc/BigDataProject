DNAC-2 is a quinolinol derivative that is bactericidal at 2X MIC. Macromolecular synthesis assays at 2 \u00d7 MIC of DNAC-2 revealed inhibition of DNA, cell wall, RNA and protein synthesis within fifteen to thirty minutes of treatment when compared to the untreated control. Transmission electron microscopy of DNAC-2-treated cells revealed a significantly thicker cell wall and impaired daughter cell separation. Exposure of USA300 cells to 1 \u00d7 MIC of DNAC-2 resulted in mislocalization of PBP2 away from the septum in an FtsZ-independent manner. In addition, membrane localization with FM4-64, as well as depolarization study with DiOC2 and lipophilic cation TPP+ displayed membrane irregularities and rapid membrane depolarization, respectively, in DNAC-2-treated cells vs -untreated control. However, DNAC-2 exhibited almost no toxicity toward eukaryotic membranes. Notably, DNAC-2 drives energy generation toward substrate level phosphorylation and the bacteria become more sensitive to DNAC-2 under anaerobic conditions. We propose that DNAC-2 affects USA300 by targeting the membrane, leading to partial membrane depolarization and subsequently affecting aerobic respiration and energy-dependent functional organization of macromolecular biosynthetic pathways. The multiple effects may have the desirable consequence of limiting the emergence of resistance to DNAC-2.The Journal of Antibiotics advance online publication, 12 July 2017; doi:10.1038\/ja.2017.79.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b62","authors":["Dhanalakshmi R Nair","Ji Chen","Jo\u00e3o M Monteiro","Michaele Josten","Mariana G Pinho","Hans-Georg Sahl","Jimmy Wu","Ambrose Cheung"],"doi":"10.1038\/ja.2017.79","first_seen_on":"2017-07-14T20:40:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0021-8820","1881-1469"],"journal":"Journal of Antibiotics","last_mentioned_on":1500034881,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ja\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ja201779a.html?WT.feed_name=subjects_drug-discovery","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/ja.2017.79"],"pmid":"28698673","pubdate":"2017-07-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Target identification","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Preclinical research","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"A quinolinol-based small molecule with anti-MRSA activity that targets bacterial membrane and promotes fermentative metabolism","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quinolinolbased-small-molecule-antimrsa-activity-targets-bacterial-membrane-promotes-fermentative-me"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208212,"mean":6.9507561304097,"rank":4361529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2279423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208212,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178967,"mean":11.460234435591,"rank":97959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":63254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178967,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":889,"mean":4.2433490990991,"rank":687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":889,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.93809523809524,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jacobmcpherson1\/statuses\/885836612621488129","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21897721],"posted_on":"2017-07-14T12:21:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Jacob McPherson","url":"http:\/\/www.aidviaaqua.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706610955845677056\/M5-z6ptE_normal.jpg","description":"Just a kid trying to stop epidemics\ud83d\udc1b ABX resistance\ud83d\udc8a environmental pollution\ud83c\udf0acarcinogens\ud83e\udd80 waterborne disease\ud83d\udca7climate change\ud83c\udf26 wildlife destruction\ud83c\udf0e","id_on_source":"jacobmcpherson1","tweeter_id":"489447903","geo":{"lt":31.25044,"ln":-99.25061,"country":"US"},"followers":292},"tweet_id":"885836612621488129"}]}}
