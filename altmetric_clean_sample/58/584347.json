Epidemiological studies indicate that childhood trauma is predominantly associated with higher rates of both mood and anxiety disorders. Exposure of rats to stress during juvenility (JS) (27-29 days of age) has comparable effects and was suggested as a model of induced predisposition for these disorders. The importance of the environment in the regulation of brain, behavior and physiology has long been recognized in biological, social and medical sciences. Here, we studied the effects of JS on emotional and cognitive aspects of depressive-like behavior in adulthood, on Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity and on the expression of cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1-CAM). Furthermore, we combined it with the examination of potential reversibility by enriched environment (EE) of JS - induced disturbances of emotional and cognitive aspects of behavior in adulthood. Three groups were tested: Juvenile Stress -subjected to Juvenile stress; Enriched Environment--subjected to Juvenile stress and then, from day 30 on to EE; and Na\u00efves. In adulthood, coping and stress responses were examined using the elevated plus-maze, open field, novel setting exploration and two way shuttle avoidance learning. We found that, JS rats showed anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in adulthood, altered HPA axis activity and altered L1-CAM expression. Increased expression of L1-CAM was evident among JS rats in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and Thalamus (TL). Furthermore, we found that EE could reverse most of the effects of Juvenile stress, both at the behavioral, endocrine and at the biochemical levels. The interaction between JS and EE resulted in an increased expression of L1-CAM in dorsal cornu ammonis (CA) area 1 (dCA1).","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009PLoSO...4.4329I","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yana Ilin","Gal Richter-Levin"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0004329","first_seen_on":"2012-02-01T05:20:25+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1460107788,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0004329","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0004329"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0004329.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2631645","pmid":"19180243","pubdate":"2009-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e4329","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Enriched Environment Experience Overcomes Learning Deficits and Depressive-Like Behavior Induced by Juvenile Stress","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enriched-environment-experience-overcomes-learning-deficits-depressivelike-behavior-induced-juvenile"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":1632101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5875697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247114,"mean":4.9290785106411,"rank":51113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":195257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247114,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107328,"mean":10.192875045422,"rank":30925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":75950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107328,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3882,"mean":7.3391378510693,"rank":910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":2956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3882,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
