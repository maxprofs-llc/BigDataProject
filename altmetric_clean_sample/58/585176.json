In addition, even if a relatively large (e.g., one half) proportion of the taste field is damaged, subjective taste experience may be unaffected. The touch system contributes to this constancy because taste sensations appear to be localized by touch. If a taste solution is painted from the side of the tongue (an area of low receptor density) past the tip (an area of high receptor density) and on to the second side, the taste sensation begins weak, gets stronger at the tip, and retains much of its intensity. The strong taste from the tip follows the tactile path of the stimulus sweep. This illusion occurs for all four stimuli tested: sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid, and quinine hydrochloride.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003325","authors":["Todrank, J","Bartoshuk, L M"],"first_seen_on":"2012-02-01T15:57:05+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0031-9384"],"issue":"5","journal":"Physiology & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1328128019,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1805264?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"1805264","pubdate":"1991-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","physiology","behavioralsciences"],"title":"A taste illusion: taste sensation localized by touch.","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/taste-illusion-taste-sensation-localized-touch"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":1786642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2632408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234221,"mean":4.2469566390575,"rank":67334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":161700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234221,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1453,"mean":6.0644214876033,"rank":730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1453,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":5.5875135135135,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
