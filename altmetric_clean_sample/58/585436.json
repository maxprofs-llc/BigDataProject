Nb(2)O(5) nanorods clearly displayed higher activity, despite their comparable surface area. With a shape-dependent surface acidity, hydrothermal stability, and high photoactivity, these Nb(2)O(5) nanorods are a unique and exciting nanomaterial for non-classical photocatalytic mineralization of organic compounds in water.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Zhao, Yun","Eley, Clive","Hu, Jingping","Foord, John S","Ye, Lin","He, Heyong","Tsang, Shik Chi Edman"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201108580","endpage":"3849","first_seen_on":"2012-02-01T19:01:29+00:00","issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"16","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
