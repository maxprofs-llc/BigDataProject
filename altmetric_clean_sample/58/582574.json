Intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation is recommended in patients with CS complicating myocardial infarction. However, there are only limited randomized controlled trial data available supporting the efficacy of IABP following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and its impact on hemodynamic parameters in patients with CS. Percutaneous coronary intervention of infarct-related artery was performed in 40 patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by CS, within 12 h of onset of hemodynamic instability. Serial hemodynamic parameters were determined over the next 4 days and compared in patients receiving medical treatment alone with those treated with additional intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. There were no significant differences among severity of disease (i.e., Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score) initially and no differences among both groups for disease improvement. We observed significant temporal improvements of cardiac output (4.8 \u00b1 0.5 to 6.0 \u00b1 0.5 L\/min), systemic vascular resistance (926 \u00b1 73 to 769 \u00b1 101 dyn \u00b7 s(-1) \u00b7 cm(-5)), and the prognosis-validated cardiac power output (0.78 \u00b1 0.06 to 1.01 \u00b1 0.2 W) within the IABP group. However, there were no significant differences between the IABP group and the medical-alone group. Additional IABP treatment did not result in a significant hemodynamic improvement compared with medical therapy alone in a randomized prospective trial in patients with CS following PCI. Therefore, the use and recommendation for IABP treatment in CS remain unclear.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008925","doi":"10.1097\/shk.0b013e31824a67af","first_seen_on":"2012-01-31T12:58:21+00:00","issns":["1073-2322"],"issue":"","journal":"Shock","last_mentioned_on":1365999237,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/shockjournal\/9000\/00000\/The_Prospective,_Randomised_IABP___Shock_Trial__.99063.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/shockjournal\/Abstract\/2012\/04000\/Hemodynamic_Effects_of_Intra_aortic_Balloon.7.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/shockjournal\/9000\/00000\/The_Prospective,_Randomised_IABP___Shock_Trial__.99063.pdf","pmid":"22266974","pubdate":"2012-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"The Prospective, Randomised IABP -
