Two randomized trials investigated tailored treatment strategies for elderly patients with glioma and reached opposite conclusions. Novel treatment approaches in recurrent glioblastoma with alternating tumour treatment fields (NovoTTF), or antiangiogenic agents (cilengitide and bevacizumab) have been reported and updated. The role of vascular endothelial growth factor-inhibiting strategies in the management of recurrent glioma remains unclear and controversial.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005863","authors":["Stupp R","Weller M"],"doi":"10.1097\/wco.0b013e3283407eed","first_seen_on":"2012-02-01T10:12:27+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Current opinion in neurology.","last_mentioned_on":1328090204,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21051962"],"pmid":"21051962","pubdate":"2010-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"2010: neuro-oncology is moving!","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/2010-neurooncology-moving"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":2312513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1572438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234227,"mean":4.2863205194986,"rank":102121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":97108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234227,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":494,"mean":2.2762190669371,"rank":234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":494,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.6,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":5,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/harpistkat\/status\/164648368679817216","citation_ids":[584620],"posted_on":"2012-02-01T09:56:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Kat Arney","url":"http:\/\/katarney.wordpress.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/875377578529488896\/p1zR7IWI_normal.jpg","description":"The Nigella of Science.
