Thus, previously reported associations between 25(OH)D with cardiometabolic risk factors using data from NHANES were likely over- or underestimated. Moreover, associations between serum 25(OH)D and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn), insulin resistance (IR), and inflammation are unclear in children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","doi":"10.3945\/ajcn.111.013516","first_seen_on":"2012-02-04T15:22:22+00:00","issns":["1938-3207"],"journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1335128435,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajcn.org\/content\/94\/1\/225.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajcn.org\/content\/94\/1\/225.full.pdf","pmid":"21613551","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are associated with prevalence of metabolic syndrome and various cardiometabolic risk factors in US children and adolescents based on assay-adjusted serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D data from NHANES 2001\u20132006","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serum-25hydroxyvitamin-d-concentrations-associated-prevalence-metabolic-syndrome-various-cardiometab-13"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2080632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2872407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237444,"mean":4.5466522997102,"rank":70768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":161428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237444,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4969,"mean":17.959553542673,"rank":3315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4969,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276,"mean":25.937236363636,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"CO":1},"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/vtangpricha\/status\/165815982902882304","citation_ids":[589796],"posted_on":"2012-02-04T15:16:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr. Vin Tangpricha","url":"https:\/\/www.doximity.com\/pub\/vin-tangpricha-md?show_more=true","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1603087378\/Tangpricha_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Emory Professor of Medicine @EmoryDeptofMed, @emoryhealthcare physician, Endocrinologist, #VitaminD #CysticFibrosis Researcher, @ATLHawks and @Braves Fan","id_on_source":"vtangpricha","tweeter_id":"40588534","geo":{"lt":33.749,"ln":-84.38798,"country":"US"},"followers":7521},"tweet_id":"165815982902882304"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AlanMalabanan\/status\/165850326472200195","rt":["vtangpricha"],"citation_ids":[589796],"posted_on":"2012-02-04T17:32:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr. Alan Malabanan","url":"http:\/\/connects.catalyst.harvard.edu\/profiles\/profile\/person\/1038","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/745383231332229120\/YtCs8gSN_normal.jpg","description":"Endocrinologist\/educator specializing in metabolic bone disease, hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D.
