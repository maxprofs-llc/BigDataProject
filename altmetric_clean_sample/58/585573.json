We conducted a prospective study to identify the direct hospitalization cost of managing major acute burns in Lagos, Nigeria, and to determine the factors that influence the cost. Method. All consecutive and consenting patients seen and managed for major burns at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, between 1 June 2007 and 31 May 2008 were recruited for the study. A special form designed for the study was used to collect the necessary data. Results. Fifty-two patients were seen during the study period (27 males and 25 females). The ages ranged from 2 months to 69 yr with a mean of 25.4 \u00b1 17.1 yr. The length of hospital stay ranged from 0.3-12 months (mean, 3.2 \u00b1 3.1 months). The average daily cost of treating a patient was \u20a6 (naira) 8,855 (\u20a61000 = \u20ac4.44) and the average overall cost was \u20a6209,303.70, with the costs of wound dressings, hospital admission, and surgery constituting respectively 29.5%, 25.7%, and 19.1% of the total amount spent. Conclusion. The length of hospital stay was prolonged in many patients and management methods should be reviewed to reduce this. The cost of managing burns is prohibitive for an average Nigerian. Efforts should be intensified to prevent burn injury and a Special Health Insurance policy should be established to finance burns management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbcb","authors":["C.N.
