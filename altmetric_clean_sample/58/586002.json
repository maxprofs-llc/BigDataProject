Photovaporization of the prostate (PVP) is now challenging TURP as the standard treatment for lower LUTS caused by BPH. The learning curve for PVP is short and the main advantages of this method over TURP are a shorter period of hospitalization, a shorter period of postoperative vesical catheterization, lower levels of retrograde ejaculation, rare development of dilutional hyponatraemia syndrome, the lack of a need for postoperative vesical irrigation as a result of extremely low indices of postoperative haematuria, and the lack of a need to suspend anticoagulant medication for the surgery. Traditionally, comparisons of the effectiveness of TURP vs PVP have involved parameters such as peak flow urinary rate and post-void residual urine volume measurements, and have employed questionnaires such as the IPSS and the International Index of Erectile Function instruments. However, studies evaluating detailed urodynamic parameters remain scarce and non-comparative The present study compared postoperative, medium-term urodynamic parameters among patients receiving TURP and high-power PVP. We consider the present study to be distinctive because it involved a double-blind, detailed functional analysis of the vesical emptying stage over the course of 2 years, and did not simply comprise an evaluation of clinical parameters and uroflowmetrics. We saw a reduction of infravesical obstruction, as shown by the significant reduction of \u226520 cm H(2)O in the mean micturition pressure for the groups studied, as well as a significant reduction in bladder outlet obstruction index. Thus, the present data show that high-power PVP can achieve and maintain the same results as TURP over a period of 24 months regarding an aspect that is particularly important for maintaining vesical health (i.e. detrusor pressure during the evacuation of the bladder). Such urodynamic data describing the functional outcome of PVP are currently missing from the literature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245a","authors":["Pereira-Correia JA","de Moraes Sousa KD","Santos JB","de Morais Perp\u00e9tuo D","Lopes-da-Silva
