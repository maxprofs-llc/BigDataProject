We measure the polarity and amplitude of the PC while varying the Fermi level by tuning a gate voltage. These measurements show that the generation of PC is by a photothermoelectric effect. The PC displays a factor of approximately 10 increase at the cryogenic temperature as compared to room temperature. Assuming the thermoelectric power has a linear dependence on the temperature, the inferred graphene thermal conductivity from temperature dependent measurements has a T(1.5) dependence below approximately 100 K, which agrees with recent theoretical predictions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010NanoL..10..562X","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","arxiv_id":"0907.3173","authors":["Xiaodong Xu","Nathaniel M.
