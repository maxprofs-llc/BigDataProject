The beneficial mechanism was historically thought to be due to the fruit acids causing a bacteriostatic effect in the urine. However, recently, a group of proanthocyanidins (PACs) with A-type linkages were isolated from cranberry which exhibit bacterial antiadhesion activity against both antibiotic susceptible and resistant strains of uropathogenic P-fimbriated Escherichia coli bacteria. The link between cranberry ingestion and maintenance of urinary tract health as well as the structural diversity, pharmacokinetics, quantification, and bacterial antiadhesion bioactivity of the A-linked cranberry PACs are reviewed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ec6","authors":["Howell AB"],"doi":"10.1002\/mnfr.200700038","first_seen_on":"2012-01-31T16:19:47+00:00","issns":["1613-4125"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecular Nutrition & Food Research","last_mentioned_on":1438347839,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17487930"],"pmid":"17487930","pubdate":"2007-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Bioactive compounds in cranberries and their role in prevention of urinary tract infections.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioactive-compounds-cranberries-role-prevention-urinary-tract-infections-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5428610,"mean":6.3209808545807,"rank":1266814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":4139338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5428610,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239878,"mean":4.6577163879823,"rank":49925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":188479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239878,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":979,"mean":7.2355337423313,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":979,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":10.366047619048,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
