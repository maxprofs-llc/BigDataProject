The assessments were performed in both very and late low-risk preterm infants and in healthy term-born infants. We report the findings in the three cohorts, evaluating the influence of gestational age and extrauterine exposure on both neurological and visual developments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002742","authors":["Mercuri E","Ricci D","Romeo DM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.earlhumdev.2011.12.025","first_seen_on":"2012-01-29T23:08:33+00:00","issns":["0378-3782","03783782"],"journal":"Early Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1327877588,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSCONTENT&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0378378211003951&_version=1&md5=0a01708217a6db5c6ff76601194eced1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"22285782","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["embryology","perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Neurological and visual assessments in very and late low-risk preterm infants ","type":"article","volume":"88 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neurological-visual-assessments-very-late-lowrisk-preterm-infants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627924,"mean":4.9449041432285,"rank":2904969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627924,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232588,"mean":3.9918581949982,"rank":168699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232588,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":362,"mean":2.9970193905817,"rank":270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":362,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.2653636363636,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
