Understanding of the genomic factors underlying fertility, which could have potential applications to improve fertility, is very limited. Here, we aimed to identify and study those genes that associated with a key fertility trait namely estrous behavior, among genes expressed in four bovine brain areas (hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal hypothalamus and ventral hypothalamus), either at the start of estrous cycle, or at mid cycle, or regardless of the phase of cycle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Arun Kommadath","Arun Kommadath","Henri Woelders","Bonne Beerda","Herman A Mulder","Agnes AC de Wit","Roel F Veerkamp","Marinus FW te Pas","Mari A Smits"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-12-200","first_seen_on":"2012-02-03T10:24:16+00:00","issns":["","1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1328297261,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/12\/200\/abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3110153","pmid":"21504592","pubdate":"2011-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"200","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Gene expression patterns in four brain areas associate with quantitative measure of estrous behavior in dairy cows","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-expression-patterns-four-brain-areas-associate-quantitative-measure-estrous-behavior-dairy-cows-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":1848048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3165117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237820,"mean":4.5465991363182,"rank":59161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":177367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237820,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4592,"mean":3.8183633195382,"rank":1665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4592,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":2.5039633027523,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
