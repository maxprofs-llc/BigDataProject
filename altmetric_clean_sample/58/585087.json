Surface alkalinization induced by a high alkalinity of the solution environment significantly shifted the surface energy band of a SrTiO(3) photocatalyst to a more negative level, supplying a strong potential for H(2)O reduction and consequently promoting the photocatalytic efficiency of H(2) evolution. This mechanism is also applicable for visible-light-sensitive La,Cr-codoped SrTiO(3) photocatalyst, which hence, could achieve a high apparent quantum efficiency of 25.6% for H(2) evolution in CH(3)OH aqueous solution containing 5 M NaOH at an incident wavelength of 425 \u00b1 12 nm.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Shuxin Ouyang","Hua Tong","Naoto Umezawa","Junyu Cao","Peng Li","Yingpu Bi","Yuanjian Zhang","Jinhua Ye"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja210610h","endpage":"1977","first_seen_on":"2012-02-01T14:48:54+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1328107168,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja210610h"],"pmid":"22280023","pubdate":"2012-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1974","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              Surface-Alkalinization-Induced Enhancement of Photocatalytic H\n              \n              Evolution over SrTiO\n              \n              -Based Photocatalysts\n            ","type":"article","volume":"134","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surfacealkalinizationinduced-enhancement-photocatalytic-h-2-evolution-srtio-3based-photocatalysts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":984845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234222,"mean":4.2650206258195,"rank":147806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":52923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234222,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15477,"mean":4.1154869475317,"rank":12138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":2755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15477,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":423,"mean":4.9478056872038,"rank":329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":423,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":4,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/skyscorpioa\/status\/164719521100333056","citation_ids":[585087],"posted_on":"2012-02-01T14:39:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Sky","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_2_normal.png","description":"","id_on_source":"skyscorpioa","tweeter_id":"304163015","followers":2},"tweet_id":"164719521100333056"}]}}
