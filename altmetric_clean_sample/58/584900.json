This study investigates the current status of marine debris ingestion by sea turtles and seabirds found along the southern Brazilian coast. All green turtles (n=34) and 40% of the seabirds (14 of 35) were found to have ingested debris. No correlation was found between the number of ingested items and turtle's size or weight. Most items were found in the intestine. Plastic was the main ingested material. Twelve Procellariiformes (66%), two Sphenisciformes (22%), but none of the eight Charadriiformes were found to be contaminated. Procellariiformes ingested the majority of items. Plastic was also the main ingested material. The ingestion of debris by turtles is probably an increasing problem on southern Brazilian coast. Seabirds feeding by diverse methods are contaminated, highlighting plastic hazard to these biota.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006690","authors":["Tourinho PS","Ivar do Sul JA","Fillmann G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.marpolbul.2009.10.013","first_seen_on":"2012-02-01T12:42:37+00:00","issns":["0025-326X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1328099442,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19931101"],"pmid":"19931101","pubdate":"2009-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Earth and Planetary Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Is marine debris ingestion still a problem for the coastal marine biota of southern Brazil?","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/marine-debris-ingestion-still-problem-coastal-marine-biota-southern-brazil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":3556432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":831457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237559,"mean":4.5429826231912,"rank":148487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237559,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1641,"mean":5.2111902439024,"rank":979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1641,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":3.7446428571429,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":42,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
