A total of 1,357 incident cases of invasive endometrial cancer and 7,609 controls were included in the analysis (MEC: 426 cases\/3,854 controls; WHI: 931 cases\/3,755 controls). The majority of women in the WHI were European American, while the MEC included sizable numbers of African Americans, Japanese and Latinos. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) per allele and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of each SNP using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, body mass index, and four principal components of ancestry informative markers. The combined ORs were estimated using fixed effect models. Rs4430796 and rs7501939 were associated with endometrial cancer risk in MEC and WHI with no heterogeneity observed across racial\/ethnic groups (P \u2265 0.21) or between studies (P \u2265 0.70). The OR(per allele) was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.89; P = 5.63 \u00d7 10(-6)) for rs4430796 (G allele) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.87; P = 3.77 \u00d7 10(-7)) for rs7501939 (A allele). The associations with the risk of Type I and Type II tumors were similar (P \u2265 0.19). Adjustment for additional endometrial cancer risk factors such as parity, oral contraceptive use, menopausal hormone use, and smoking status had little effect on the results. In conclusion, HNF1B SNPs are associated with risk of endometrial cancer and that the associated relative risks are similar for Type I and Type II tumors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E0390S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Setiawan VW","Haessler J","Schumacher F","Cote ML","Deelman E","Fesinmeyer MD","Henderson BE","Jackson RD","V\u00f6ckler JS","Wilkens LR","Yasmeen S","Haiman CA","Peters U","Le Marchand L","Kooperberg C"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0030390","first_seen_on":"2012-02-03T20:29:41+00:00","funders":["nci","phs"],"issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1328300695,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22299039?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22299039","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e30390","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"HNF1B and Endometrial Cancer Risk: Results from the PAGE study.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hnf1b-endometrial-cancer-risk-results-page-study-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3108253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":995734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234433,"mean":4.2626728091731,"rank":147951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":55142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234433,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80034,"mean":8.2675999650144,"rank":55417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80034,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4013,"mean":6.0424177467597,"rank":2560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4013,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/NicholasMMurphy\/status\/165531228731211777","citation_ids":[588864],"posted_on":"2012-02-03T20:24:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Nick Murphy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/978677061\/345_n_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"NicholasMMurphy","tweeter_id":"74478819","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":814},"tweet_id":"165531228731211777"}]}}
