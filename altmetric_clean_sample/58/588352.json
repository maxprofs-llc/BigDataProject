Fifteen patients, with a median age of 62 years, received trastuzumab according to the schedule approved for breast cancer patients (ie, 4 mg\/kg intravenous loading dose followed by 2 mg\/kg weekly). The overall response rate was 13% with 2 patients achieving partial response and partial remission cytolytic response, respectively. Two other patients were documented with blast clearance. Only 1 reversible grade 3 cardiac toxic event occurred. This phase 2 study showed that trastuzumab monotherapy can allow for some responses in a very high-risk refractory\/relapsed HER2-positive adult B-ALL population. Combination of trastuzumab with chemotherapy or other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies should be tested in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","doi":"10.1182\/blood-2011-11-390781","first_seen_on":"2012-02-03T14:24:11+00:00","issns":["1528-0020"],"journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1328278838,"links":["http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/early\/2012\/01\/20\/blood-2011-11-390781.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/early\/2012\/01\/20\/blood-2011-11-390781.full.pdf","pmid":"22267607","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Trastuzumab for treatment of refractory\/relapsed HER2-positive adult B-ALL: results of a phase II GRAALL study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trastuzumab-treatment-refractoryrelapsed-her2positive-adult-ball-results-phase-2-graall-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3084135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":968851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234437,"mean":4.2891619717111,"rank":147368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":50363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234437,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7808,"mean":2.8862402971692,"rank":5732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":1390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7808,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":762,"mean":1.8042286465177,"rank":498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":762,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
