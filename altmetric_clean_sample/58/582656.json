However, little work has been done to document the psychosocial processes that underlie this Gene \u00d7 Environment interaction. One process may involve the conversion of intellectual interest into academic achievement. Analyses of data from 777 pairs of 17-year-old twins indicated that Gene \u00d7 SES effects on achievement scores can be accounted for by stronger influences of genes for intellectual interest on achievement at higher levels of SES. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that higher SES affords greater opportunity for children to seek out and benefit from learning experiences that are congruent with their genetically influenced intellectual interests.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4c93cf058f61000013c","authors":["Tucker\u2010Drob, Elliot M.","Harden, K.
