Of particular interest is Leaf Area Index (LAI), which is an informative, yet notoriously challenging parameter to efficiently measure in situ. While photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR) sensors have been validated for measuring crop LAI, there is limited literature on the efficacy of PAR-based LAI measurement in the forest environment. This study (i) validates PAR-based LAI measurement in forest environments, and (ii) proposes a suitable collection protocol, which balances efficiency with measurement variation, e.g., due to sun flecks and various-sized canopy gaps. A synthetic PAR sensor model was developed in the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) model and used to validate LAI measurement based on first-principles and explicitly-known leaf geometry. Simulated collection parameters were adjusted to empirically identify optimal collection protocols. These collection protocols were then validated in the field by correlating PAR-based LAI measurement to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) extracted from the \"classic\" Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C) data ( R 2 was 0.61). The results indicate that our proposed collecting protocol is suitable for measuring the LAI of sparse forest (LAI < 3-5 ( m 2 \/ m 2 )).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Yao, W"],"doi":"10.3390\/s16071092","first_seen_on":"2016-10-10T10:43:31+00:00","issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"7","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1476096200,"links":["http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1514882\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4970138","pmid":"27428969","pubdate":"2016-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1092","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Towards an Improved LAI Collection Protocol via Simulated and Field-Based PAR Sensing","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/towards-improved-lai-collection-protocol-via-simulated-fieldbased-par-sensing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":6514728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239635,"mean":12.453353046729,"rank":197435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239635,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2848,"mean":1.8114380049175,"rank":1916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2848,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":1.5646179401993,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Environmental Science":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ucl_discovery\/statuses\/785430509891547136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12531412],"posted_on":"2016-10-10T10:43:20+00:00","author":{"name":"UCL Discovery","url":"http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/631451975817805824\/GfvbIz0w_normal.png","description":"UCL Discovery is a central open access showcase of UCL research.
