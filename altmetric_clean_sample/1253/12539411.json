The refraction of his mild hyperopic eyes (+0,5 dpt) changed to -5,5 dpt and the intraocular pressure increased to 40 mm Hg in the right and 42 mm Hg in the left eye. Accommodation and pupillary reflexes were normal. Ultrasonic examination showed an increased axial diameter and a forward shifting of the lens. The resulting flattening of the anterior chamber induced the angle closure glaucoma. All symptoms disappeared within a week after the administration of Fluocortulon had been discontinued.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f84","authors":["Schroeder, W","Schwarzer, J"],"first_seen_on":"2016-10-10T15:52:13+00:00","issns":["0023-2165"],"issue":"5","journal":"Klinische Monatsbl\u00e4tter f\u00fcr Augenheilkunde","last_mentioned_on":1476114839,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27665"],"pmid":"27665","pubdate":"1978-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"[Transient myopia with angle closure glaucoma.
