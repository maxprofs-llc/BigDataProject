All the patients underwent whole-body FCH PET\/CT and DCE-MRI of the pelvis. An overall pattern of recurrent disease was analyzed, and diagnostic accuracy for the detection of pelvic disease recurrence by the 2 modalities was evaluated by taking histopathologic analysis as the criterion standard. The whole-body FCH PET\/CT images were also analyzed separately for the presence of any extra lesion(s).\nThe initial mean Gleason score was 6.3 \u00b1 1.53 (range, 4-9). The mean prostate-specific antigen levels at the time of relapse were 1.9 \u00b1 2.87 ng\/mL (range, 0.24-13.2 ng\/mL). MRI findings were positive for primary tumor recurrence in the prostate bed in 6 patients (6\/20 [30.0%]), pelvic lymph node metastases in 4 patients (4\/20 [20.0%]), and for pelvic skeletal metastases in 2 patients (2\/20 [10.0%]), respectively. On the other hand, FCH PET\/CT results were positive in the corresponding sites in 7 (7\/20 [35.0%]), 9 (9\/20 [45.0%]), and 2 patients (2\/20 [10.0%]), respectively. F-fluorocholine PET\/CT and MRI showed comparable results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for PC characterization. The whole-body FCH PET\/CT was found to be useful in identifying unknown distant metastases in a significant proportion of patients.\nThe correlative whole-body FCH PET\/CT and pelvic DCE-MRI offer a complementary and comprehensive diagnostic workup for better management of PC patients with BCR following RP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Vadi, Shelvin Kumar","Singh, Baljinder","Basher, Rajender K.","Watts, Ankit","Sood, Ashwani K.","Lal, Anupam","Kakkar, Nandita","Singh, S.K."],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0000000000001689","first_seen_on":"2017-05-21T08:42:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0363-9762","1536-0229"],"journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1495356125,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28525448?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28525448","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"18F-Fluorocholine PET\/CT Complementing the Role of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Providing Comprehensive Diagnostic Workup in Prostate Cancer Patients With Suspected Relapse Following Radical Prostatectomy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/18ffluorocholine-petct-complementing-role-dynamic-contrastenhanced-mri-providing-comprehensive-diagn"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":7133976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236678,"mean":12.170764746891,"rank":191884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236678,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2331,"mean":1.0385004291845,"rank":1683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2331,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":0.73833333333333,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/statuses\/866212490845147137","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20363314],"posted_on":"2017-05-21T08:42:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24774},"tweet_id":"866212490845147137"}]}}
