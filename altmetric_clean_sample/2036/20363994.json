Thirteen blood samples were obtained for each TP applied. Plasma concentrations were determined, and the area under the curve, peak serum concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax were calculated.\nFentanyl: Cmax was observed at different time points: for the first TP application: 30 hours for 50\u00a0\u03bcg hour(-1), 6 hours for 75\u00a0\u03bcg hour(-1) and 100\u00a0\u03bcg hour(-1) patches; and for the second TP application: 30 hours for 50\u00a0\u03bcg hour(-1) and 36 hours for 75\u00a0\u03bcg hour(-1) patches. Buprenorphine: serum concentrations were not detected for the 35\u00a0\u03bcg hour(-1) patch; Cmax was observed at different times for the 70\u00a0\u03bcg hour(-1) patch: 18 hours (n\u00a0=\u00a01), 24 hours (n\u00a0=\u00a03), 30 hours (n\u00a0=\u00a01) and 42 hours (n\u00a0=\u00a01) after application of the first patch and 12 hours after the second patch.\nA relevant serum concentration obtained with fentanyl TP dosed at 75\u00a0\u03bcg hour(-1) or 100\u00a0\u03bcg hour(-1)suggests that TPs could represent an analgesia option for laboratory pigs weighing 25-30\u00a0kg. As concentrations of buprenorphine were variable, this study does not support the use of buprenorphine TPs in pigs. Consecutive fentanyl or buprenorphine TPs did not provide reliable serum concentrations. Further pharmacokinetic studies and analgesiometric tests in swine are needed to confirm the clinical adequacy of TPs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f7","authors":["Suzanne Osorio Lujan","Walid Habre","Youssef Daali","Zhaoxin Pan","Peter W.
