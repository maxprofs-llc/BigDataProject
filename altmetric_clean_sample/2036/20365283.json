Plasticity in web design is hypothesised to be important for spiders building in habitats where environmental conditions cause considerable web damage. Here we compared web characteristics of the orb spider Metellina mengei (Araneae, Tetragnathidae) in two different forest habitats differing in their wind exposure. We found a notable lack of differences in web geometry, orientation and inclination between webs built along an exposed forest edge and those built inside the forest, despite marked differences in wind speed. This suggests that M. mengei did not exhibit web-building plasticity in response to wind in the field, contrasting with the findings of laboratory studies on other species of orb spiders. Instead, differences in prey capture and wind damage trade-offs between habitats may provide an explanation for our results, indicating that different species employ different strategies to cope with environmental constraints.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dfc","authors":["Nicholas Tew","Thomas Hesselberg"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10905-017-9618-0","first_seen_on":"2017-05-21T12:27:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0892-7553","1572-8889"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Insect Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1495369628,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10905-017-9618-0"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10905-017-9618-0.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5488162","pmid":"28680193","pubdate":"2017-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agriculture","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Behavioral Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"The Effect of Wind Exposure on the Web Characteristics of a Tetragnathid Orb Spider","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-wind-exposure-web-characteristics-tetragnathid-orb-spider"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":7133973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236678,"mean":12.170747634962,"rank":191884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236678,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291,"mean":2.9150206896552,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.82083333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BehavEcolPapers\/statuses\/866269125504520192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20365283],"posted_on":"2017-05-21T12:27:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Behav Ecol Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/517345050670268416\/beckzx8T_normal.jpeg","description":"Papers in behavioral ecology #ethology animal #behavior from #PubMed & journal feeds @ASNAmNAT @PLOSBiology @LinneanSociety - literature bot by @MihalyFoldvari","id_on_source":"BehavEcolPapers","tweeter_id":"2797948887","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1166},"tweet_id":"866269125504520192"}]}}
