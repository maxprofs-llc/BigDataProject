PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an important cause of visual impairment in elderly people. AMD is a multifactorial disease in which both environmental and genetic factors have been implicated. Various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to be associated with AMD.\nThis study was aimed to investigate the association of polymorphisms in VEGF genes with age related macular degeneration (AMD) in Indian patients.\nGenotyping for the VEGF -\u00a01154 (G\u00a0>\u00a0A), -\u00a02578 (C\u00a0>\u00a0A), +\u00a0405 (G\u00a0>\u00a0C) and -\u00a0460 (C\u00a0>\u00a0T) SNPs was performed in 100 AMD patients and 100 controls by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequencing method.\nOut of the four SNPs, heterozygous genotypes of VEGF -\u00a01154\u00a0G\u00a0>\u00a0A (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.58, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0035), +\u00a0460\u00a0C\u00a0>\u00a0T (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.90, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0046), and +\u00a0405\u00a0G\u00a0>\u00a0C (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.02, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) have shown susceptible association with AMD. However, VEGF -\u00a02578\u00a0C\u00a0>\u00a0A did not show any statistical significance. Further A-A-G-T haplotype comprising of three mutant alleles revealed risk association (OR\u00a0=\u00a012.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0030) with AMD.\nThe present study suggests significant genetic associations for VEGF -\u00a01154\u00a0G\u00a0>\u00a0A, +\u00a0460\u00a0C\u00a0>\u00a0T, and +\u00a0405\u00a0G\u00a0>\u00a0C polymorphisms with AMD. Early detection of individuals with risk to these SNPs could lead to strategies for prevention, early diagnosis, and management of AMD.","altmetric_jid":"537f30862a83eeb45a8b462c","authors":["Gupta, Divya","Gupta, Vani","Singh, Vinita","Prakash, Swayam","Agrawal, Suraksha","Chawla, Shobhit","Phadke, Shubha R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mgene.2016.07.011","endpage":"253","first_seen_on":"2016-09-13T14:21:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2214-5400","22145400"],"journal":"Meta Gene","last_mentioned_on":1473776457,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27617226?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27617226","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"249","title":"Vascular endothelial growth factor gene polymorphisms and association with age related macular degeneration in Indian patients","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vascular-endothelial-growth-factor-gene-polymorphisms-association-age-related-macular-degeneration-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":7237665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252190,"mean":12.435512096086,"rank":209380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252190,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":2.0255643564356,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.0178571428571,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/775700800643276800","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11977756],"posted_on":"2016-09-13T14:20:57+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"775700800643276800"}]}}
