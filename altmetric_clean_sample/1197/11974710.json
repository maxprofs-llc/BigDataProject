New #TBresearch finds that ACF can mitigate costs","Active TB case finding in Cambodia, potential to reduce financial burden on households before treatment starts"],"citation":{"abstract":"Despite free TB services available in public health facilities, TB patients often face severe financial burden due to TB. WHO set a new global target that no TB-affected families experience catastrophic costs due to TB. To monitor the progress and strategize the optimal approach to achieve the target, there is a great need to assess baseline cost data, explore potential proxy indicators for catastrophic costs, and understand what intervention mitigates financial burden. In Cambodia, nationwide active case finding (ACF) targeting household and neighbourhood contacts was implemented alongside routine passive case finding (PCF). We analyzed household cost data from ACF and PCF to determine the financial benefit of ACF, update the baseline cost data, and explore whether any dissaving patterns can be a proxy for catastrophic costs in Cambodia.\nIn this cross-sectional comparative study, structured interviews were carried out with 108 ACF patients and 100 PCF patients. Direct and indirect costs, costs before and during treatment, costs as percentage of annual household income and dissaving patterns were compared between the two groups.\nThe median total costs were lower by 17% in ACF than in PCF ($240.7 [IQR 65.5-594.6] vs $290.5 [IQR 113.6-813.4], p = 0.104). The median costs before treatment were significantly lower in ACF than in PCF ($5.1 [IQR 1.5-25.8] vs $22.4 [IQR 4.4-70.8], p<0.001). Indirect costs constituted the largest portion of total costs (72.3% in ACF and 61.5% in PCF). Total costs were equivalent to 11.3% and 18.6% of annual household income in ACF and PCF, respectively. ACF patients were less likely to dissave to afford TB-related expenses. Costs as percentage of annual household income were significantly associated with an occurrence of selling property (p = 0.02 for ACF, p = 0.005 for PCF).\nTB-affected households face severe financial hardship in Cambodia. ACF has the great potential to mitigate the costs incurred particularly before treatment. Social protection schemes that can replace lost income are critically needed to compensate for the most devastating costs in TB. An occurrence of selling household property can be a useful proxy for catastrophic cost in Cambodia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Fukushi Morishita","Rajendra-Prasad Yadav","Mao Tan Eang","Saly Saint","Nobuyuki Nishikiori"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0162796","first_seen_on":"2016-09-13T10:37:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1475496660,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162796","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0162796","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162796#authcontrib","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0162796"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0162796.PDF","pmid":"27611908","pubdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0162796","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Mitigating Financial Burden of Tuberculosis through Active Case Finding Targeting Household and Neighbourhood Contacts in Cambodia","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mitigating-financial-burden-tuberculosis-through-active-case-finding-targeting-household-neighbourho"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":4.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":1523813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5941652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240904,"mean":12.191926675882,"rank":68548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":171859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240904,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106870,"mean":10.181282336318,"rank":29211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":77395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106870,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4168,"mean":9.6354763618911,"rank":1227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":2930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4168,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ZA":1,"NL":1},"mendeley":{"KH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lutlynen\/statuses\/781431399438057472","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11974710],"posted_on":"2016-09-29T09:52:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Lut Lynen","url":"https:\/\/pure.itg.be\/en\/persons\/lutgarde-lynen(82c8cb24-0ce8-4a31-ac70-9a2f986f092c).html&L=N","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1755174956\/SAM_0242_normal.jpg","description":"Working at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Head of Department Clinical Sciences, Unit of Infectious Diseases & HIV\/AIDS","id_on_source":"lutlynen","tweeter_id":"138540367","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":370},"tweet_id":"781431399438057472"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/paimadhu\/statuses\/775644492368080896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11974710],"posted_on":"2016-09-13T10:37:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Madhu Pai, MD,PhD","url":"http:\/\/www.paitbgroup.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/756691400561926144\/hIRNmO0o_normal.jpg","description":"Director of @McGillGHP.
