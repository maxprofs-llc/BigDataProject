Subclinical hypothyroid patients were given L-T4 replacement therapy for one-year to keep the thyroid hormone (TSH) values in normal ranges. Before and after the treatment clinical and laboratory parameters compared with each other for case and control groups.\nWhen we compared the pre and post treatment values of subclinical hypothyroid patients; The systolic and diastolic blood pressures, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and framingham risk scores obviously decreased (p < 0.05). Although, at the begining of the study ten-year cardiovacular risk of the case group was significantly higher than that of control group, after treatment no difference was found between the two groups (p < 0.05 vs p > 0.05).\nBy using Framingham Risk Score, its obviously seen that in subclinical hypothyroid patients, just by thyroid hormone replacement therapy a marked decrease of cardiovascular risk can be obtained.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005d3f","authors":["Sertbas, Y","Akcan, Y","Yazici, M"],"doi":"10.7727\/wimj.2015.160","first_seen_on":"2016-09-13T10:11:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0043-3144","00433144"],"journal":"West Indian Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1473760952,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27618219?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27618219","pubdate":"2015-10-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Cardiovascular Risk Assesment of Subclinical Hypothyroid Patients by Using Framingham Risk Score","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cardiovascular-risk-assesment-subclinical-hypothyroid-patients-using-framingham-risk-score"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":7237793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252191,"mean":12.43569257306,"rank":209429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252191,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":2.1606492146597,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pmidcalc\/statuses\/775635769599942660","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11974076],"posted_on":"2016-09-13T10:02:32+00:00","author":{"name":"pmidCALC","url":"http:\/\/www.pmidcalc.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/532077188288221184\/tjo8N6V9_normal.png","description":"Keep up to date with the latest scoring systems that will impact your practice.We also support @evidencio_org project.
