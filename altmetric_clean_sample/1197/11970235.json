Optic nerve head parameters as well as pRNFL, mRNFL, GCC, and GCIPL thicknesses were measured in all subjects. Optic disk areas (ODAs) >2.70 mm(2) were defined as macrodisks. All spectral domain optical coherence tomography parameters were compared between normal-sized disks and macrodisks.\nThe mean age of the participants was 49.4\u00b15.7 years in the normal size group and 51.55\u00b16.3 years in the macrodisk group (P=0.65). The average ODAs were 2.23\u00b10.29 mm(2) and 3.30\u00b10.59 mm(2) in the normal size and the macrodisk groups, respectively. ODA (P<0.001), cup area (P<0.001), cup disk area ratio (P<0.001), horizontal cup disk ratio (P<0.001), vertical cup disk ratio (P<0.001), horizontal disk diameter (P<0.001), vertical disk diameter (P<0.001), and cup volume (P<0.001) were significantly higher in the macrodisk group. The inferior mRNFL thickness was significantly lower (P=0.042), and the GCC inferior and GCIPL inferior thicknesses were found to be lower with low significance (P=0.052, P=0.059, respectively) in the macrodisk group. Rim volume (P=0.622), total pRNFL (P=0.201), superior pRNFL (P=0.123), inferior pRNFL (P=0.168), average macular thickness (P=0.162), total mRNFL (P=0.171), superior mRNFL (P=0.356), total GCC (P=0.080), superior GCC (P=0.261), total GCIPL (P=0.214), and superior GCIPL (P=0.515) thicknesses were similar in both groups.\nOptic disk topography and retinal structures show different characteristics in healthy eyes with macrodisks. These disk size-dependent variations suggest that large optic disks may be more susceptible to glaucomatous damage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f15","authors":["Zeynep Kayaarasi Ozturker","Kadir Eltutar","Belma Karini","Sezin Erkul","Ozen Osmanbasoglu","Pinar Sultan"],"doi":"10.2147\/opth.s102789","first_seen_on":"2016-09-13T04:28:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-5467"],"journal":"Clinical Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1473740871,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/optic-nerve-head-topography-and-retinal-structural-changes-in-eyes-wit-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=32369","pmid":"27672304","pubdate":"2016-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","title":"Optic nerve head topography and retinal structural changes in eyes with macrodisks: a comparative study with spectral domain optical coherence tomography","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optic-nerve-head-topography-retinal-structural-changes-eyes-macrodisks-comparative-study-spectral-do"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":6353945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1134903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252190,"mean":12.435820594871,"rank":177681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252190,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1296,"mean":2.6901868725869,"rank":749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1296,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":4.7666666666667,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DovePressEye\/statuses\/775551543953063936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11970235],"posted_on":"2016-09-13T04:27:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Press Eye","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=22","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294808374\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest articles covering all areas of eyecare published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DovePressEye","tweeter_id":"53267341","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":37},"tweet_id":"775551543953063936"}]}}
