Although FDH has been described in children and adults, the cardinal signs of the fetal phenotype are not straightforward impacting the quality of the prenatal diagnosis. We describe in depth the ultrasound, radiological, macroscopical, and histological phenotype of three female fetuses with a severe form of FDH, propose a review of the literature and an attempt to delineate minimal and cardinal signs for FDH diagnosis. This report confirms the variability of FDH phenotype, highlights unreported FDH features, and allows delineating evocative clinical associations for prenatal diagnosis, namely intrauterine growth retardation, limbs malformations, anterior wall\/diaphragm defects, and eye anomalies. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697d","authors":["Mary, Laura","Scheidecker, Sophie","Kohler, Monique","Lombardi, Maria\u2010Paola","Delezoide, Anne\u2010Lise","Auberger, Elisabeth","Triau, St\u00e9phane","Colin, Estelle","Gerard, Marion","Grzeschik, Karl\u2010Heinz","Dollfus, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","Antal, Maria Cristina"],"doi":"10.1002\/ajmg.a.37974","first_seen_on":"2016-09-13T15:40:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-4833"],"journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics.
