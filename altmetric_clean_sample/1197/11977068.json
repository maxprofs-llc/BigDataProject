Owing to their inherent high ring strain, such structures readily undergo ring opening under a variety of conditions, including thermolysis, photolysis, and transition metal catalysis, to afford reactive intermediates that can be trapped with nucleophiles, dienophiles, and unsaturated bonds. Their electron-deficient enone moieties are good electrophiles for facile nucleophilic addition. Such properties render cyclobutenones versatile synthons, serving as excellent coupling partners in a vast array of synthetically valuable transformations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Chen, Peng\u2010hao","Dong, Guangbin"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201603382","first_seen_on":"2016-09-13T13:37:02+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1521-3765"],"journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1473773806,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/chem.201603382"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201603382\/pdf","pmid":"27620805","pubdate":"2016-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Cyclobutenones and Benzocyclobutenones: Versatile Synthons in Organic Synthesis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cyclobutenones-benzocyclobutenones-versatile-synthons-organic-synthesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":7237669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252190,"mean":12.43554401659,"rank":209385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252190,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6293,"mean":3.1823115066751,"rank":4540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6293,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":463,"mean":2.9363333333333,"rank":285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":463,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
