We found that serial doses of micro-concentration LPS significantly increased the platelet count in mice treated with kanamycin, along with increased expression of IL-6 compared with IL-3 and TPO in megakaryocytes obtained from the mouse bone morrow following LPS administration. Furthermore, LPS at lower levels ranging plus IL-6 effectively stimulated CFU-MK formation and increased CD41 expression and megakaryocyte polyploidization. Meanwhile, there was a sustained rise in the percentage of reticulated platelets in the whole blood in response to low-dosage LPS combined with IL-6. In vivo experiments also demonstrated that the administration of LPS combined with IL-6 substantially enhanced the number of circulating platelets in normal and thrombocytopenic mice. Notably, the optimal LPS concentration in combination with IL-6 might be a novel stimulator of TLR4 and IL-6R expression in Dami cell lines, which initially occurs through TLR4-IL-6R crosstalk and then involves the activation of NF-\u03baB and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. These data suggest a new paradigm for the regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production via a synergistic effect of LPS and IL-6, which has the potential to be used for the design of new therapies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Wu, Di","Xie, Jun","Wang, Xuejun","Zou, Bingcheng","Yu, Yin","Jing, Tao","Zhang, Songmei","Zhang, Qing"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep13748","first_seen_on":"2016-09-13T13:22:49+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1473772954,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26330186?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26330186","pubdate":"2015-09-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Polysaccharides","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Haematopoietic cell growth factors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cell division","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"13748","subjects":["science"],"title":"Micro-concentration Lipopolysaccharide as a Novel Stimulator of Megakaryocytopoiesis that Synergizes with IL-6 for Platelet Production","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microconcentration-lipopolysaccharide-novel-stimulator-megakaryocytopoiesis-synergizes-il6-platelet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":7237672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252191,"mean":12.435505610849,"rank":209387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252191,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37053,"mean":14.729151516787,"rank":30892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37053,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3134,"mean":17.107298436004,"rank":2626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3134,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
