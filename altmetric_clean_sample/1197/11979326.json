The presence of tension in the epidermis has morphogenetic implications for organ shapes but it also constantly threatens the integrity of this tissue. Here, we explore the multi-scale relationship between tension and cell adhesion in the plant epidermis, and we examine how tensile stress perception may act as a regulatory input to preserve epidermal tissue integrity and thus normal morphogenesis. From this, we identify parallels between plant epidermal and animal epithelial tissues and highlight a list of unexplored questions for future research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","authors":["Roberta Galletti","St\u00e9phane Verger","Olivier Hamant","Gwyneth C.
