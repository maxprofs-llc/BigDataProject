Frequency tables were generated for Internet, cell phone, and social media use and preferences. Chi-squared analysis was used to evaluate differences across age and income groups.\nA total of 291 individuals participated and were predominantly female (69.0%). Majority reported incomes less than $30,000 (72.9%) and identified as African American\/Black\/Caribbean (49.3%) or Mexican\/Mexican American (34.3%). Most participants regularly used smartphones (63.2%) and the Internet (75.9%). Respondents frequently used Facebook (84.8%), and less commonly used Instagram (43.6%), and Twitter (20.0%). Free Internet-based exercise programs were the most preferred method to increase PA levels (31.6%), while some respondents (21.0%) thought none of the surveyed technology applications would help.\nCell phone, Internet, and social media use is common among the surveyed underserved population. Technology preferences to increase PA levels varied, with a considerable number of respondents not preferring the surveyed technology platforms. Creating educational opportunities to increase awareness may maximize the effectiveness of technology-based PA interventions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de9","authors":["Medairos, Robert","Kang, Vicky","Aboubakare, Carissa","Kramer, Matthew","Dugan, Sheila Ann"],"doi":"10.1123\/jpah.2016-0162","endpage":"19","first_seen_on":"2016-09-13T10:28:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1543-5474","1543-3080"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Activity and Health","last_mentioned_on":1473764355,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27618680?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27618680","pubdate":"2016-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Physical Activity in an Underserved Population: Identifying Technology Preferences","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physical-activity-underserved-population-identifying-technology-preferences"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":6353899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1134974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252190,"mean":12.435656432279,"rank":177665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252190,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":534,"mean":6.7119774859287,"rank":409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":534,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":6.1947368421053,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
