This is a rare example of a Rh(i)\/Rh(iii) cycle and a redox neutral Rh(i) cycle being promoted by a single catalyst. The process is broad in scope, allowing significant variation of all three reaction components. Incorporation of an enantiomerically pure bis-phosphine ligand renders the process enantioselective. Superior levels of enantioselectivity (up to >99% ee) can be achieved from using a two catalyst system, whereby two Rh(i) complexes, one incorporating an achiral bis-phosphine ligand and the second a chiral diene ligand, are introduced at the start of the reaction sequence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e4d","authors":["Maitane Fern\u00e1ndez","Matthias Castaing","Michael C.
