Immunohistochemical stains have been used to augment routine histological examination to aid in differentiating DF from DFSP. Stromelysin-3 (ST3) is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, MMP-11, which is expressed in the skin during wound healing and in the stroma of basal cell carcinoma. Recent studies demonstrated that DFs expressed ST3, whereas DFSPs were only rarely ST3 positive.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002442","authors":["Kim, H.J.","Lee, J.Y.","Kim, S.H.","Seo, Y.J.","Lee, J.H.","Park, J.K.","Kim, M.H.","Cinn, Y.W.","Cho, K.H.","Yoon, T.Y."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2133.2007.08033.x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T22:37:18+00:00","issns":["1365-2133"],"journal":"British Journal of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1325626876,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1365-2133.2007.08033.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17596171"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2133.2007.08033.x\/pdf","pmid":"17596171","pubdate":"2007-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Stromelysin-3 expression in the differential diagnosis of dermatofibroma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: comparison with factor XIIIa and CD34.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stromelysin3-expression-differential-diagnosis-dermatofibroma-dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-compar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631865,"mean":4.925550910502,"rank":816065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631865,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94628,"mean":8.0899610681943,"rank":24592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94628,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2191,"mean":3.2427506849315,"rank":303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2191,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":5.47325,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Benign fibrous histiocytoma","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=469399009#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3282451],"posted_on":"2012-01-03T21:41:16+00:00","summary":"Benign fibrous histiocytomas (also known as Dermal dendrocytoma, Dermatofibroma, Fibrous dermatofibroma, Fibrous histiocytoma, Fibroma simplex, Nodular subepidermal fibrosis, and Sclerosing hemangioma) are benign skin growths.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=1220348","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rjwilmsi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rjwilmsi"}}]}}
