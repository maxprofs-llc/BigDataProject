These calculi are composed of calcium salts either alone or in combination with other mineral salts, and are usually of small size - though there have been occasional reports of large tonsilloliths or calculi in peritonsillar locations. We present the case of a 55-year-old woman with a one-year history of dysphagia and pharyngeal discomfort with a foreign body sensation, though the manifestations had recently intensified. Exploration of the oral cavity revealed a hard bulging submucosal mass in the region of the soft palate, at right anterior tonsillar pillar level. The mucosa overlying the lesion appeared erythematous. Computed tomography revealed a large, delimited and highly calcified oval image measuring 2.5 x 1.5 cm, which was subsequently surgically removed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Silvestre-Donat FJ","Pla-Mocholi A","Estelles-Ferriol E","Martinez-Mihi V"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T21:54:17+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Medicina Oral, Patologia Oral y Cirugia Bucal","last_mentioned_on":1176769383,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15876967"],"pmid":"15876967","pubdate":"2005-05-06T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Giant tonsillolith: report of a case.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/giant-tonsillolith-report-case"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":816557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94260,"mean":8.0686884223259,"rank":24421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94260,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215,"mean":1.6665794392523,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.975,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
