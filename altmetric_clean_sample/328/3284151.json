It has been suggested that the use of finger-trap traction results in a better reduction and a lower rate of redisplacement than manual manipulation does, but to our knowledge these concepts have never been evaluated scientifically. We compared these two methods in a prospective, randomized controlled trial.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd4","authors":["S A Earnshaw","A Aladin","S Surendran","C G Moran"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T23:23:46+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9355"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery, American Volume","last_mentioned_on":1215727273,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11886903"],"pmid":"11886903","pubdate":"2002-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Closed reduction of colles fractures: comparison of manual manipulation and finger-trap traction: a prospective, randomized study.","type":"article","volume":"84-A","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/closed-reduction-colles-fractures-comparison-manual-manipulation-fingertrap-traction-prospective-ran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627970,"mean":4.9447382433571,"rank":817354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627970,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94027,"mean":8.0342942803056,"rank":24333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94027,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1219,"mean":3.8720098522167,"rank":277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1219,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.002380952381,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
