ASC-2 contained two nuclear receptor-interaction domains, both of which are dependent on the integrity of their core LXXLL sequences. Surprisingly, the C-terminal LXXLL motif specifically interacted with oxysterol receptor LXRss, whereas the N-terminal motif bound a broad range of nuclear receptors. These interactions appeared to be essential because a specific subregion of ASC-2 including the N- or C-terminal LXXLL motif acted as a potent dominant negative mutant with transactivation by appropriate nuclear receptors. In addition, the autonomous transactivation domain (AD) of ASC-2 was found to consist of three separable subregions; i.e. AD1, AD2, and AD3. In particular, AD2 and AD3 were binding sites for CREB binding protein (CBP), and CBP-neutralizing E1A repressed the autonomous transactivation function of ASC-2. Furthermore, the receptor transactivation was not enhanced by ASC-2 in the presence of E1A and significantly impaired by overexpressed AD2. From these results, we concluded that ASC-2 directly binds to nuclear receptors and recruits CBP to mediate the nuclear receptor transactivation in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e5","authors":["S K Lee","S Y Jung","Y S Kim","S Y Na","Y C Lee","J W Lee"],"doi":"10.1210\/mend.15.2.0595","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T22:35:36+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0888-8809"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecular Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1248106338,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11158331"],"pmid":"11158331","pubdate":"2001-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","endocrinology"],"title":"Two distinct nuclear receptor-interaction domains and CREB-binding protein-dependent transactivation function of activating signal cointegrator-2.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-distinct-nuclear-receptorinteraction-domains-crebbinding-proteindependent-transactivation-functi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4782626,"mean":5.7258040009438,"rank":1161073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3031506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4782626,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169369,"mean":8.6435912450997,"rank":49597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":117560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169369,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":922,"mean":2.5542866449511,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":922,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":0.7375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Chemistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"CREB-binding protein","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=303154620#altmetric_citation_87","license":"public","citation_ids":[3282378,3282379],"posted_on":"2009-07-20T16:12:18+00:00","summary":"CREB-binding protein, also known as CREBBP or CBP, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CREBBP gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=9927027","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Yeast2Hybrid","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Yeast2Hybrid"}},{"title":"Liver X receptor beta","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=172599455#altmetric_citation_8","license":"public","citation_ids":[3282378,3282379],"posted_on":"2007-11-20T00:32:08+00:00","summary":"Liver X receptor beta (LXR-\u03b2) is a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14323822","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
