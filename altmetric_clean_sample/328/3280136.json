Dried heartwood powder of C. deodara was first defatted with petroleum ether and then extracted with chloroform. The chloroform extract showed strong antioxidant activity on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. This fraction was then subjected to separation and purification using silica gel column chromatography. Three compounds with potent antioxidant activity were isolated in significant yields and identified by spectroscopic methods ((1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR, and MS). They were identified as (-)-matairesinol, (-)-nortrachelogenin, and a dibenzylbutyrolactollignan (4,4',9-trihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-9,9'-epoxylignan). This is the first report of the occurrence of these compounds in C. deodara.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["A K Tiwari","P V Srinivas","S P Kumar","J M Rao"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T21:33:58+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-8561"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1379939293,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11600001"],"pmid":"11600001","pubdate":"2001-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Free radical scavenging active components from Cedrus deodara.","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/free-radical-scavenging-active-components-cedrus-deodara"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636226,"mean":4.921076943263,"rank":816755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636226,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95163,"mean":8.1395817868478,"rank":24827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95163,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3310,"mean":4.4220948927168,"rank":699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3310,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":11.038404761905,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Ph.
