Mutations leading to an amino acid change were found in 2 of 17 (12%) oligodendrogliomas and 2 of 19 (11%) medulloblastomas but none of 15 ependymomas. Sites of mutations were in exon 5 (codon 141), exon 6 (codon 193 and 213), and exon 7 (codon 246). In addition, there were silent mutations in exon 6 (codon 213) in one oligodendroglioma and in one ependymoma. This study points to the possible role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in some central nervous system neoplasms of divergent histogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Hiroko Ohgaki","Robert H.
