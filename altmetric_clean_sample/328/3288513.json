Here we report that sister chromatid cohesion is formed and maintained by a unique mechanism. In fission yeast, Eso1p, functioning in close coupling to DNA replication, establishes sister chromatid cohesion whereas the newly identified Cohesin-associated protein Pds5p hinders the establishment of cohesion until counteracted by Eso1p, yet stabilizes cohesion once it is established. Eso1p interacts physically with Pds5p via its Ctf7p\/Eco1p-homologous domain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Koichi Tanaka","Zhonglin Hao","Mihoko Kai","Hiroto Okayama"],"doi":"10.1093\/emboj\/20.20.5779","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T01:13:17+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1460-2075","0261-4189"],"issue":"20","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1311393840,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/emboj\/20.20.5779","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11598020","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC125673"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/content\/embojnl\/20\/20\/5779.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC125673","pmid":"11598020","pubdate":"2001-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"EMBO Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Establishment and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion in fission yeast by a unique mechanism","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/establishment-maintenance-sister-chromatid-cohesion-fission-yeast-unique-mechanism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":816372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94115,"mean":8.0880374227003,"rank":24372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94115,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999,"mean":3.1911050525263,"rank":589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":9.2347826086957,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
