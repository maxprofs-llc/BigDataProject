Evidence Aid has a dedicated website (www.EvidenceAid.org) to provide access to more than 160 systematic reviews and several other documents relevant to people working on disaster risk reduction, planning, response, recovery, rehabilitation, and resilience. It combines this with a social media presence and Special Collections that bundle together related Cochrane Reviews (www.TheCochraneLibrary.com). The aim is to make it easier for users who need this evidence and don't have time to browse through multiple documents and distill them before making their decisions. Evidence Aid will continue to identify and share resources and knowledge with those who most need it at the time that they need it most. It is working with several partners to identify relevant Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews and is engaging with users who, by sharing their information and their knowledge needs, will allow Evidence Aid to target its efforts to these priority areas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fda","authors":["Allen, Claire"],"doi":"10.1111\/jebm.12127","endpage":"237","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T01:35:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-5391",""],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1428458562,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jebm.12127\/abstract;jsessionid=684827DDD7019CAA1E3D5BCD28A224A4.f04t03","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jebm.12127"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jebm.12127\/pdf","pmid":"25586451","pubdate":"2014-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"234","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"A resource for those preparing for and responding to natural disasters, humanitarian crises, and major healthcare emergencies","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resource-those-preparing-responding-natural-disasters-humanitarian-crises-major-healthcare-emergenci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6349979,"mean":5.981194595635,"rank":1231241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5082495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6349979,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196972,"mean":8.5017703925959,"rank":48809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":147568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196972,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":5.0356901408451,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":8.825,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
