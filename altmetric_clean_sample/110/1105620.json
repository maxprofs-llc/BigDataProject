Seventy children (9-16 years old) were randomly assigned to either of the programs (n (CBT) = 36; n (SR) = 34). Measures on child's anxiety using the Spence Child Anxiety Scale--Child (SCAS-C) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI--S) were administered at pre-, post-treatment, and follow-ups (3- and 6-month). Children in both programs showed significantly lower levels of generalized anxiety and total anxiety symptoms at 6-month follow-up on SCAS-C. Clinician ratings on the CGI-S demonstrated an increase in the percentage of participants rated as \"Normal\" and \"Borderline\" for both programs. Findings from the present study suggest factors such as regular sessions in a structured setting, consistent therapists, social exposure and the use of autism-friendly strategies are important components of an effective framework in the management of anxiety in children and adolescents with ASD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002506","authors":["Sung M","Ooi YP","Goh TJ","Pathy P","Fung DS","Ang RP","Chua A","Lam CM"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10578-011-0238-1","endpage":"649","first_seen_on":"2012-12-04T20:32:01+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0009-398X","1573-3327"],"issue":"6","journal":"Child Psychiatry & Human Development","last_mentioned_on":1413189960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21660428"],"pmid":"21660428","pubdate":"2011-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Child and School Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"634","subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy on anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorders: a randomized controlled trial.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-cognitivebehavioral-therapy-anxiety-children-autism-spectrum-disorders-randomized-controlled-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.44,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.44},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8433822,"mean":7.0916068747407,"rank":1558576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6874109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8433822,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295877,"mean":6.8314459773688,"rank":59777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":236088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295877,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":405,"mean":4.4285198019802,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":405,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.825,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
