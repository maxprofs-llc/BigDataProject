The concomitant occurrence of INH- and EMB- induced psychosis and in a single individual is extremely uncommon. We report a case of 28-year-old male who developed psychotic symptoms on start of EMB initially and later on INH also. He was prescribed rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ofloxacin and had no further psychotic symptoms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f61000474d","authors":["Prasad R.","Rajiv Garg","Sanjay Kumar Verma"],"doi":"10.4103\/1817-1737.43083","first_seen_on":"2012-12-05T17:44:45+00:00","issns":["1817-1737"],"issue":"4","journal":"Annals of Thoracic Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1354729476,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2700450\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2700450","pmid":"19561898","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"149","title":"Isoniazid- and ethambutol-induced psychosis","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isoniazidand-ethambutolinduced-psychosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":2015565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275998,"mean":5.6725466218837,"rank":147228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":79400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275998,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":3.0005617977528,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.6055555555556,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
