It is unknown to what extent whole-body heat loss is impaired when skin grafts cover a significant (eg, >50%) proportion of TBSA. The authors examined whole-body heat exchange during and after 60 min of cycling exercise in the heat (35\u00b0C; 25% relative humidity), at a fixed rate of metabolic heat production (~400 W) in a woman (age, 36 years; mass, 78.2 kg) with well-healed (17+ years) skin grafts covering 75% of TBSA. Her responses were compared with two noninjured control subjects. Whole-body evaporative and dry heat exchange were measured by direct calorimetry. While exercising in the same ambient conditions and at the same rate of heat production, relative evaporative heat loss of nongrafted skin in the grafted subject (ie, evaporative heat loss per m) was nearly twice that of the control subjects. However, total rate of evaporative heat loss reached only 59% of the amount required for heat balance in the skin-grafted subject compared with 92 \u00b1 3% in controls. Thus, the increase in core temperature was 2-fold greater for the grafted (1.22\u00b0C) vs control (0.61 \u00b1 0.19\u00b0C) individuals. This case study demonstrates that a large area of grafted skin greatly diminishes maximum evaporative heat loss during exercise in the heat, making a compensable environment for control subjects uncompensable for skin-grafted individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059fe","doi":"10.1097\/bcr.0b013e31826c32c0","first_seen_on":"2012-12-03T02:25:25+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1559-047X"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of burn care & research","last_mentioned_on":1382855633,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/burncareresearch\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Effect_of_Human_Skin_Grafts_on_Whole_Body_Heat.99118.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/burncareresearch\/Abstract\/2013\/07000\/Effect_of_Human_Skin_Grafts_on_Whole_Body_Heat.21.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/burncareresearch\/9000\/00000\/Effect_of_Human_Skin_Grafts_on_Whole_Body_Heat.99118.pdf","pmid":"23202874","pubdate":"2012-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"","title":"Effect of Human Skin Grafts on Whole-Body Heat Loss During Exercise Heat Stress: A Case Report","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-human-skin-grafts-wholebody-heat-loss-during-exercise-heat-stress-case-report-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6574878,"mean":6.0977594546637,"rank":4622699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1711006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6574878,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286974,"mean":6.3885342871979,"rank":176165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":96024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286974,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1172,"mean":1.7818958155423,"rank":450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1172,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":1.4914634146341,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JBurnCareOnline\/statuses\/275425443778269184","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1102039],"posted_on":"2012-12-03T02:25:17+00:00","author":{"name":"JrnlBurnCareResearch","url":"http:\/\/www.burncareresearch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1581665833\/bcr_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Burn Care & Research provides the latest information on advances in burn prevention, research, education, delivery of acute care, and research.","id_on_source":"JBurnCareOnline","tweeter_id":"388301935","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":102},"tweet_id":"275425443778269184"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JBurnCareOnline\/status\/394351223400185857","license":"public","citation_ids":[1102039],"posted_on":"2013-10-27T06:33:53+00:00","author":{"name":"JrnlBurnCareResearch","url":"http:\/\/www.burncareresearch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1581665833\/bcr_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Burn Care & Research provides the latest information on advances in burn prevention, research, education, delivery of acute care, and research.","id_on_source":"JBurnCareOnline","tweeter_id":"388301935","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":102},"tweet_id":"394351223400185857"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Effect of Human Skin Grafts on Whole-Body Heat Loss During E... : Journal of Burn Care & Research","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=452294761525175&id=167412800013374","license":"public","citation_ids":[1102039],"posted_on":"2013-05-10T02:35:12+00:00","summary":"Ahead of Print:","author":{"name":"Journal of Burn Care & Research","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/167412800013374","facebook_wall_name":"Journal of Burn Care & Research","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/167412800013374\/picture","id_on_source":"167412800013374"}}]}}
