Ticks from dogs living in southern Italy were all identified as Rhipicephalus sanguineus (n=25), ticks from central Italy included Rh. sanguineus (n=8) and Ixodes ricinus (n=9), ticks from northern Italy included Rh. sanguineus (n=45), Dermacentor marginatus (n=3), and one I. ricinus. Leishmania infantum, Rickettsia spp., and Babesia canis were the only pathogens detected in 7 (8%), 4 (4%), and 2 (2%) out of 91 ticks, respectively. L. infantum was detected in I. ricinus from central Italy and in Rh. sanguineus from northern and central Italy. Rickettsia conorii and Ri. massiliae were detected in Rh. sanguineus ticks from central and southern Italy (Sicily), respectively. Bab. canis was detected in D. marginatus ticks from northern Italy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b72","authors":["Trotta M","Nicetto M","Fogliazza A","Montarsi F","Caldin M","Furlanello T","Solano-Gallego L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ttbdis.2012.10.031","first_seen_on":"2012-12-05T12:06:40+00:00","issns":["1877-959X","1877959X"],"journal":"Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1354709192,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1877959X12001161"],"pmid":"23182545","pubdate":"2012-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier GmbH.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["parasitology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Detection of Leishmania infantum, Babesia canis, and rickettsiae in ticks removed from dogs living in Italy ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-leishmania-infantum-babesia-canis-rickettsiae-ticks-removed-dogs-living-italy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3556692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280626,"mean":5.8934123545656,"rank":227449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280626,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":410,"mean":1.9272420537897,"rank":327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":410,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.9578125,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
