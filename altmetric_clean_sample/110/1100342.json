Although previous studies have established a role for mTORC1 as necessary for enduring changes in postsynaptic function, here we demonstrate that dendritic mTORC1 activation in rat hippocampal neurons also drives a retrograde signaling mechanism promoting enhanced neurotransmitter release from apposed presynaptic terminals. This novel mode of synaptic regulation conferred by dendritic mTORC1 is locally implemented, requires downstream synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor as a retrograde messenger, and is engaged in an activity-dependent fashion to support homeostatic trans-synaptic control of presynaptic function. Our findings thus reveal that mTORC1-dependent translation in dendrites subserves a unique mode of synaptic regulation, highlighting an alternative regulatory pathway that could contribute to the social and cognitive dysfunction that accompanies dysregulated mTORC1 signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.2149-12.2012","first_seen_on":"2012-12-01T12:42:11+00:00","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"48","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1354365722,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23197706?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23197706","pubdate":"2012-11-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Retrograde Changes in Presynaptic Function Driven by Dendritic mTORC1.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retrograde-changes-presynaptic-function-driven-dendritic-mtorc1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2306213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1590816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280528,"mean":5.8772484074616,"rank":140405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":104444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280528,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10243,"mean":6.6512216363992,"rank":5778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10243,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":328,"mean":7.1538042813456,"rank":188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":328,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
