Erythromycin is the recommended antibiotic for treatment and prophylaxis of pertussis; however, side effects of erythromycin limit its usefulness in some patients. Clarithromycin, a newer macrolide, has good in vitro activity against Bordetella pertussis and a better side effect profile.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008487","authors":["Lebel, M H","Mehra, S"],"first_seen_on":"2012-12-05T19:28:46+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0891-3668"],"issue":"12","journal":"The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal","last_mentioned_on":1354743265,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11740322?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"11740322","pubdate":"2001-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases","pediatrics"],"title":"Efficacy and safety of clarithromycin versus erythromycin for the treatment of pertussis: a prospective, randomized, single blind trial.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-safety-clarithromycin-versus-erythromycin-treatment-pertussis-prospective-randomized-single-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2924947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1434410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280627,"mean":5.893402934867,"rank":176753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":91718,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280627,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1965,"mean":2.2239012219959,"rank":967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1965,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.2201030927835,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
