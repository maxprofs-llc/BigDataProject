Eighteen pulp revascularizations were performed in 2009 using the original protocol of revascularization (adapted from the AAE\/AAPD joint meeting in 2007 in Chicago). The protocol consisted of opening the canal and disinfecting it with sodium hypochlorite, sealing in a triple antibiotic paste for 2-6 weeks, re-opening, re-irrigating, creating a blood clot in the canal, and sealing with an MTA barrier over the clot. Three problems were encountered during the treatment: (1) bluish discoloration of the crown; (2) failure to produce bleeding; and (3) collapse of the mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) material into the canal. Modifications to solve these problems included: changing one of the antibiotics, using a local anesthesia without epinephrine, and adding collagen matrix to the blood clot.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032ab","first_seen_on":"2012-12-06T11:26:59+00:00","issns":["1942-5473"],"issue":"5","journal":"Pediatric Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1355755830,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23211919?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23211919","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"title":"Clinical complications in the revascularization of immature necrotic permanent teeth.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-complications-revascularization-immature-necrotic-permanent-teeth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2938723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1425795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280883,"mean":5.8819310101752,"rank":181662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":88654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280883,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144,"mean":1.5668811188811,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":0.7675,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
