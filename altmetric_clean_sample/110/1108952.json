Here we review what is known about the sorting signals, machineries and pathways that maintain this asymmetry, and how polarity proteins interface with membrane-trafficking pathways to generate membrane domains de novo. It is becoming apparent that membrane traffic does not simply reinforce polarity, but is critical for the generation of cortical epithelial cell asymmetry.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","authors":["Gerard Apodaca","Luciana I.
