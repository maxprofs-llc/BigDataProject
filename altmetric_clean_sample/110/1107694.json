Although immunization practices have reduced the occurrence of the disease among children, waning vaccine- and infection-induced immunity still allows the disease to affect adolescents and adults who, in turn, can transmit the disease to non-immunized or partially immunized infants. This document is the result of a meeting in Mexico City of international experts who analyzed recent medical information in order to establish the current status of the epidemiology, diagnosis and surveillance of pertussis and, especially, the value of the dTpa booster dose in adolescents and adults as a pertussis prevention strategy in Mexico.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Beltr\u00e1n Silva S","Cervantes Apolinar Y","Cherry JD","Conde Gonz\u00e1lez C","Gentile A","G\u00f3mez Altamirano CM","Hern\u00e1ndez Porras M","Huerta Garc\u00eda G","Mac\u00edas Parra M","Mart\u00ednez Aguilar G","Mascare\u00f1as de los Santos A","Moreno Espinosa S","Pacheco R\u00edos A","Prado Cohrs D","Rodriguez Weber MA","Romano Mazzotti L","Rosales Uribe E","Sifuentes Osornio J","Ulloa-Guti\u00e9rrez R","Villase\u00f1or Sierra A"],"first_seen_on":"2012-12-05T19:25:45+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Salud P\u00fablica de M\u00e9xico","last_mentioned_on":1354735538,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21340141?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21340141","pubdate":"2011-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"[Consensus on the clinical and microbiologic diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis, and infection prevention.
