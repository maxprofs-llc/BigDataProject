The aim of this study was to evaluate whether concomitant multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCAD) can affect long-term outcome. Thus, long-term results of SVR associated with multiple coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for MVCAD (group 1) were compared with SVR with or without CABG to left anterior descending artery and\/or its diagonal branch for single-vessel coronary artery disease (group 2).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb8","doi":"10.2459\/jcm.0b013e32832f9fc1","first_seen_on":"2012-12-02T15:58:08+00:00","issns":["1558-2027"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1354463879,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcardiovascularmedicine\/Abstract\/2010\/02000\/Long_term_outcomes_after_surgical_ventricular.5.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcardiovascularmedicine\/2010\/02000\/Long_term_outcomes_after_surgical_ventricular.5.pdf","pmid":"19952949","pubdate":"2010-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"96","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Long-term outcomes after surgical ventricular restoration and coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with postinfarction left ventricular anterior aneurysm","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-outcomes-after-surgical-ventricular-restoration-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-patients-po"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3073087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":950875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280495,"mean":5.885230343608,"rank":188855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":53152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280495,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":825,"mean":0.83917475728155,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":825,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.71296296296296,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JCardioMedicine\/statuses\/275267577041793024","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1101418],"posted_on":"2012-12-02T15:57:59+00:00","author":{"name":"J Cardio Medicine","url":"http:\/\/www.jcardiovascularmedicine.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1694904724\/JCM_cover_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Cardiovascular Medicine is a monthly publication of the Italian Federation of Cardiology.","id_on_source":"JCardioMedicine","tweeter_id":"437606168","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":347},"tweet_id":"275267577041793024"}]}}
