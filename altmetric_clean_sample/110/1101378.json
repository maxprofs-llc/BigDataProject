In creating these new formulations, the paradigm of drug development target should be introduced. Biological targets relating to the nature of addiction may pose insurmountable hurdles based on our current knowledge and technology, but products that use behavioral targets seem logical and feasible. The population of opioid abusers is large and diverse so behavioral targets are more challenging than they appear at first glance. Furthermore, we need to find ways to correlate behavioral observations of drug liking to actual use and abuse patterns. This may involve revisiting some pharmacodynamic concepts in light of drug effect rather than peak concentration. In this paper we present several new opioid analgesic agents designed to resist or deter abuse using physical barriers, the inclusion of an opioid agonist or antagonist, an aversive agent, and a prodrug formulation. Further, this paper also provides insight into the challenges facing drug discovery in this field. Designing and screening for opioids intended to resist or deter abuse is an important step to meet the public health challenge of burgeoning prescription opioid abuse.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f610004382","authors":["Pergolizzi, Jason"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/282981","first_seen_on":"2012-12-02T15:05:16+00:00","issns":["2090-1542"],"journal":"Pain Research & Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1354460375,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/prt\/2012\/282981\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/prt\/2012\/282981.pdf","pmid":"23213510","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Designing Opioids That Deter Abuse","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/designing-opioids-deter-abuse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5379019,"mean":6.2856175725768,"rank":2856342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1828172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5379019,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285470,"mean":6.2087083711368,"rank":140585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":113233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285470,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":4.5353069306931,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.25,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
