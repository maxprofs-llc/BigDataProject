In an earlier study (Zekveld et al. 2008), we showed that speech comprehension in noise by young listeners with normal hearing improves when presenting partly incorrect, automatically generated subtitles. The current study focused on the effects of age, hearing loss, visual working memory capacity, and linguistic skills on the benefit obtained from automatically generated subtitles during listening to speech in noise.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100058a1","doi":"10.1097\/aud.0b013e3181987063","first_seen_on":"2012-12-04T23:36:36+00:00","issns":["0196-0202"],"issue":"2","journal":"Ear and hearing (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1354664190,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ear-hearing\/Abstract\/2009\/04000\/The_Influence_of_Age,_Hearing,_and_Working_Memory.11.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ear-hearing\/2009\/04000\/The_Influence_of_Age,_Hearing,_and_Working_Memory.11.pdf","pmid":"19194286","pubdate":"2009-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"262","subjects":["audiology"],"title":"The Influence of Age, Hearing, and Working Memory on the Speech Comprehension Benefit Derived from an Automatic Speech Recognition System","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-age-hearing-working-memory-speech-comprehension-benefit-derived-automatic-speech-recogniti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770903,"mean":5.7215656817113,"rank":3380664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":776736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770903,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282381,"mean":6.0684221545436,"rank":187037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":48158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282381,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":794,"mean":2.3534779319042,"rank":445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":794,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.209375,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
