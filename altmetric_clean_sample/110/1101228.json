We present a 23-year-old male who experienced persistent marked pruritus for eighteen years and recurrent jaundice for thirteen years, in addition to cholestasis that eventually became fatal. Genetic sequencing studies of the entire coding (exon) sequences of ATP8B1 and ABCB11 uncovered a novel heterozygous missense 3035G>T mutation (S1012I) and a synonymous 696T>C mutation in ATP8B1. The patient's progression was associated with not only impaired familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (FIC1) function but also impaired bile salt export pump expression due to the impaired FIC1 function. Our findings show that patients with intermittent cholestasis can develop progressive liver disease even after several decades and require regular follow up.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","doi":"10.3748\/wjg.v18.i44.6504","first_seen_on":"2012-12-02T09:52:24+00:00","issns":["1007-9327"],"issue":"44","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1354441195,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23197899?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23197899","pubdate":"2012-11-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Novel ATP8B1 mutation in an adult male with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-atp8b1-mutation-adult-male-progressive-familial-intrahepatic-cholestasis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619417,"mean":4.9286052998637,"rank":2903911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619417,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275743,"mean":5.6924494926419,"rank":220333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275743,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1810,"mean":2.4235190713101,"rank":1198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1810,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.3311111111111,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
