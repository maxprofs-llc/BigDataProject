In contrast to other inflammatory myopathies, myositis-specific autoantibodies had not been found in sIBM patients until recently. We used human skeletal muscle extracts as a source of antigens to detect autoantibodies in sIBM and to characterize the corresponding antigen.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005726","authors":["Pluk, Helma","Hoeve, Bas J.
