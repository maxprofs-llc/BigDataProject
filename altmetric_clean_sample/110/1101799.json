With adequate surgical treatment and electrode arrays designed for hearing preservation, partial hearing preservation can nowadays be achieved in the majority of patients. Over recent years, the number of patients with EAS has increased, and device failures within this group are a problem that will need to be addressed. It remains unclear how reliably hearing can be preserved during revision surgery. The outcome of 3 subjects requiring cochlear reimplantation after surgery for hearing preservation is presented and discussed. Our aim was to investigate the influence of electrode reinsertion on hearing preservation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000841d","authors":["Helbig S","Rajan GP","St\u00f6ver T","Lockley M","Kuthubutheen J","Green KM"],"doi":"10.1097\/mao.0b013e318277a44e","endpage":"65","first_seen_on":"2012-12-02T22:17:48+00:00","issns":["1531-7129"],"issue":"1","journal":"Otology & Neurotology","last_mentioned_on":1359026008,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/otology-neurotology\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Hearing_Preservation_After_Cochlear_Reimplantation.98393.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/otology-neurotology\/9000\/00000\/Hearing_Preservation_After_Cochlear_Reimplantation.98393.pdf","pmid":"23202149","pubdate":"2012-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"61","subjects":["otolaryngology","neurology"],"title":"Hearing Preservation After Cochlear Reimplantation","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hearing-preservation-after-cochlear-reimplantation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":677780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3825748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280492,"mean":5.8763005586633,"rank":49966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":230253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280492,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1728,"mean":1.3776757382745,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":1697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1728,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":1.2019230769231,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
