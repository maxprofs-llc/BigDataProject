The facial computed tomographic scan showed the soft tissue swelling without any bony abnormality, and the symptoms did not improve after 1 week of antibacterial therapy. The patient had a diagnosis of a late infection caused by unresorbed plates, and exploratory surgery was performed. Partially resorbed plates and screws were seen, and we removed the remnants of such completely. The symptoms were relieved after the operation, and there was no recurrence during 8 months of follow-up.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","doi":"10.1097\/scs.0b013e3181f5387c","first_seen_on":"2012-12-03T11:40:03+00:00","issns":["1049-2275"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1354534789,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Abstract\/2010\/11000\/Delayed_Infection_After_a_Zygoma_Fracture_Fixation.97.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/2010\/11000\/Delayed_Infection_After_a_Zygoma_Fracture_Fixation.97.pdf","pmid":"21119490","pubdate":"2010-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2018","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Delayed Infection After a Zygoma Fracture Fixation With Absorbable Plates","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/delayed-infection-after-zygoma-fracture-fixation-absorbable-plates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3545581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280113,"mean":5.8840981607358,"rank":224719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280113,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2563,"mean":0.82201170960187,"rank":1279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2563,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158,"mean":0.92452229299363,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
