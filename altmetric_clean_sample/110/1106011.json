However, the de Sitter metric appears to be perfectly static in the Schwarzschild frame where the vacuum fluid is supposed to be in motion. Here we highlight the conflicts between the static and non-static versions of the de-Sitter metric from a physical perspective. In particular, while the \"Principle of Energy Conservation\" is honored in one case, the same is badly violated for the other. However, we offer a partial resolution of such conflicts by deriving the static de Sitter metric by solving the relevant field equations. It is seen that, it is the very special vacuum equation of state pressure = -density which results in the static form even when the vacuum fluid is supposed to be in motion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Abhas Mitra"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep00923","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2012-12-05T00:50:55+00:00","issns":["2045-2322",""],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1477070393,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2012\/121204\/srep00923\/full\/srep00923.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2012\/121204\/srep00923\/metrics","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep00923","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/srep00923"],"pmid":"23213359","pubdate":"2012-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cosmology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Astronomy and planetary science","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Physics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"","subjects":["science"],"title":"Interpretational conflicts between the static and non-static forms of the de Sitter metric","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interpretational-conflicts-between-static-nonstatic-forms-sitter-metric"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.55,"score_history":{"1y":3.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7571218,"mean":6.5337981331095,"rank":774136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6795963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7571218,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290436,"mean":6.5244373577565,"rank":36509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":253867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290436,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29231,"mean":14.8693083818,"rank":5746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":23477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29231,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":369,"mean":12.683766304348,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":369,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
