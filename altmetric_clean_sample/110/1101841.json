Polysaccharide and total alkaloid are the two most important components of Fuzi. However, little is known about the antidepressant-like effect of Fuzi total alkaloid. To investigate the antidepressant-like effect of Fuzi total alkaloid, behavioral studies were performed in the open field test and forced swimming test. Repeated intragastric administration of Fuzi total alkaloid for 7 days (10 mg\/kg) to normal mice decreased immobility time compared to the vehicle group. Furthermore, repeated administration of Fuzi total alkaloid (10 or 30 mg\/kg) to ovariectomized mice also decreased immobility time in a dose-dependent manner. However, these antidepressant-like behavioral effects were not simply due to locomotor hyperactivity. Further experiments showed that Fuzi total alkaloid enhanced the ratio of phospho-CREB\/CREB (cAMP response element-binding) and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) protein level in the frontal cortex and hippocampus in ovariectomized mice but not in normal mice. These results indicate that the CREB-BDNF pathway may be involved in the antidepressant-like effect of Fuzi total alkaloid in ovariectomized mice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de1","first_seen_on":"2012-12-02T23:03:24+00:00","issns":["1347-8648"],"journal":"Journal of Pharmacological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1354489392,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23196901?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23196901","pubdate":"2012-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Antidepressant-like Effect of Fuzi Total Alkaloid on Ovariectomized Mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antidepressantlike-effect-fuzi-total-alkaloid-ovariectomized-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":2898349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275884,"mean":5.6610801825413,"rank":219351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275884,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205,"mean":1.7687745098039,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.80555555555556,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"HU":1,"US":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnxietyNews\/statuses\/275374586617540608","license":"public","citation_ids":[1101841],"posted_on":"2012-12-02T23:03:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Social Anxiety Help","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/anxietynews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1133209691\/Anxiety-News-Logo_normal.jpg","description":"Latest News, Treatment, Helpful Information For Those Of Us Battling Social Anxiety, GAD, Depression TOGETHER WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER, TOGETHER WE CAN GIVE HOPE!","id_on_source":"AnxietyNews","tweeter_id":"195630483","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":3339},"tweet_id":"275374586617540608"}]}}
