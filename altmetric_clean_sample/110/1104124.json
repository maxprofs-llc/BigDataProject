Image guidance is needed for radiofrequency ablation needle placement, as well as evaluation of the size of the ablation burn and determination if any residual tumor is present. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is unique in its ability to provide image guidance for this procedure. In addition to improved visualization of the mass for needle placement, the contrast can be injected multiple times during the procedure to evaluate the size of the ablation burn and the presence of residual tumor, if any. This article describes how to use contrast-enhanced ultrasound to perform radiofrequency ablation of renal masses. Pictorial cases are used to demonstrate the robustness of this technique.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005d2d","doi":"10.1097\/ruq.0b013e318274de66","first_seen_on":"2012-12-04T06:46:34+00:00","issns":["0894-8771"],"issue":"4","journal":"Ultrasound quarterly","last_mentioned_on":1358268555,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ultrasound-quarterly\/Abstract\/2012\/12000\/Contrast_Enhanced_Ultrasound_Guided_Radiofrequency.5.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ultrasound-quarterly\/2012\/12000\/Contrast_Enhanced_Ultrasound_Guided_Radiofrequency.5.pdf","pmid":"23149509","pubdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"269","subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound-Guided Radiofrequency Ablation of Renal Tumors","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contrastenhanced-ultrasoundguided-radiofrequency-ablation-renal-tumors-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2124145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2228500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280397,"mean":5.8927194610479,"rank":125731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":142025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280397,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":589,"mean":0.78695578231293,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":589,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.80714285714286,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
