Due to small sizes, they can improve bioavailability of therapeutic agents and pass through biological barriers of the eye, such as the cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, and even more, blood-retinal barriers. Another important characteristic of nanoparticles is the ability to be fabricated based on the researchers' design through chemical processes. In this regard, they can act as a novel drug delivery system, enabling targeted therapies for angiogenesis-related blindness (ARB). With these possibilities, many researchers have utilized nanoparticles as novel therapeutic options for the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, both of which are characterized by pathologic neovascularization. In this review, we summarize various attempts and rationales in using nanoparticles to treat ARB. After that, we discuss the toxicity of nanoparticles on the retina. We expect this review to be a stepping stone for novel therapeutics for ARB, resulting in improvement in visual outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e95","authors":["Dong Hyun Jo"],"doi":"10.1089\/jop.2012.0113","first_seen_on":"2012-12-04T21:44:00+00:00","issns":["1080-7683"],"journal":"Journal of Ocular Pharmacology & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1354577401,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/jop.2012.0113"],"pmid":"23145865","pubdate":"2012-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy","ophthalmology"],"title":"Nanoparticles in the Treatment of Angiogenesis-Related Blindness","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanoparticles-treatment-angiogenesisrelated-blindness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":2907381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275715,"mean":5.7013583133249,"rank":220189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275715,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":1.8776335877863,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.0357142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
