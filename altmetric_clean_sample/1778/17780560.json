Collateral vessel quality on pretreatment computed tomographic (CT) angiography was evaluated on a 4-point grading scale, and patients were dichotomized as having poor or good collateral flow. Outcome measures included successful reperfusion according to Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction score, good outcome at 3 months defined as a modified Rankin scale score \u2264 2, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH; sICH), and mortality.\nA total of 72 patients with TO (mean age, 65.6 y \u00b1 12.8) were treated. Intravenous thrombolysis was performed in 54.1% of patients, and a carotid stent was inserted in 48.6%. Successful reperfusion was achieved in 64% of patients, and a good outcome was achieved in 32%. sICH occurred in 12.5% of patients, and the overall mortality rate was 32%. Univariate analysis demonstrated that good outcome was associated with good collateral flow (P = .0001), successful reperfusion (P = .001), and lower rate of any ICH (P = .02) and sICH (P = .04). On multivariate analysis, good collateral flow (odds ratio [OR], 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.75; P = .01) and age (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.15; P = .01) were the only predictors of good outcome. The use of more than one device for thrombectomy was the only predictor of sICH (OR, 10.74; 95% CI, 1.37-84.13; P = .02).\nEndovascular treatment for TO resulted in good outcomes. Collateral flow and age were independent predictors of good clinical outcomes at 3 months.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f16","authors":["Fabrizio Sallustio","Caterina Motta","Giacomo Koch","Silvia Pizzuto","Bruce C.V.
