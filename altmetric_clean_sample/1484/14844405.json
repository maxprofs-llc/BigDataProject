The aluminum foil plays a dual role as both the active anode material and the current collector, which enhances the energy density of the packaged battery, and reduces the production cost. This generalized battery configuration has high potential for application in next-generation lithium-ion batteries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Ji, Bifa","Zhang, Fan","Sheng, Maohua","Tong, Xuefeng","Tang, Yongbing"],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201604219","first_seen_on":"2016-12-19T08:09:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-4095"],"journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1482425933,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201604219\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/adma.201604219"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201604219\/pdf","pmid":"27943407","pubdate":"2016-12-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"1604219","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"A Novel and Generalized Lithium-Ion-Battery Configuration utilizing Al Foil as Both Anode and Current Collector for Enhanced Energy Density","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-generalized-lithiumionbattery-configuration-utilizing-al-foil-both-anode-current-collector-enh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":11,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7921887,"mean":6.701594642987,"rank":701532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7211063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7921887,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251391,"mean":12.38248040097,"rank":35600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":215501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251391,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4250,"mean":10.716456578018,"rank":694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4250,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170,"mean":18.566556213018,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
