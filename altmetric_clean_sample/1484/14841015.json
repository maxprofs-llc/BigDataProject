In-hospital acquisition times for most isolates were also delineated.\nAmong 2728 (94.3%) isolates proven with \u03b2-lactamase production, the rates of non-susceptibility to imipenem were low (average\u200a=\u200a7.9%) among IAI Enterobacteriaceae isolates from all Asia-Pacific countries except Vietnam (17.7%) and the Philippines (10.2%). A stepwise and significant increase in annual rates of carbapenemase production among these isolates was noted. CTX-M-15 and CTX-M-14 were the dominant ESBL variants in most IAI Enterobacteriaceae species. The most abundant AmpC \u03b2-lactamase variants were blaCMY-2 among isolates of Escherichia coli and blaDHA-1 among isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. In addition, the IAI Enterobacteriaceae isolates harbouring a blaCMY-2 or blaDHA-1 allele were associated with high community-acquired rates (38.0% and 42.6%, respectively). AmpC ACT and MIR variants were mostly detected in Enterobacter species. The blaNDM-1,4,5,7-harbouring isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were most commonly identified among IAI isolates from Vietnam and the Philippines. Also of note, blaOXA-48-harbouring IAI Enterobacteriaceae isolates were detected exclusively in Vietnam.\nThe high resistance burden in Vietnam and the Philippines warrants aggressive control policies to combat the worsening trend in antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae species causing IAIs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c89","authors":["Shio-Shin Jean","Po-Ren Hsueh","on behalf of the SMART Asia-Pacific Group","Tony Korman","Justin Ellem","Narelle George","Geoffrey Coombs","Thomas Ling","Owen Tsang","V.
