This study investigated the outcomes of VT ablation associated with mechanical support using percutaneous ventricular assist device (PVAD) versus intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).\nWe retrospectively examined the outcomes of patients who underwent VT ablation associated with PVAD versus IABP from 2010-2013, captured by the Medicare Inpatient Standard Analytic File database. Data from 345 patients (PVAD\u00a0=\u00a0230, IABP\u00a0=\u00a0115) were examined. On admission, the incidence of heart failure was higher in PVAD (84.3% vs. 73.0%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) with similar rates of renal failure in PVAD versus IABP (33.0% vs. 37.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.42). However, PVAD was associated with reduced in-hospital cardiogenic shock (9.1% vs. 23.5%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), renal failure (11.7% vs. 21.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and length of stay (8.4\u00b17.9 vs. 10.6\u00b17.5; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but with greater hospital discharges to home\/self-care (66.0% vs. 51.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Index mortality (6.5% vs. 19.1%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock (18.2% vs. 41.2%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) were significantly lower with PVAD versus IABP. Furthermore, PVAD was associated with lower all-cause (27.0% vs. 38.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and heart failure-related (21.4% vs. 33.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) 30-day hospital re-admissions, but with similar redo-VT ablation rates at 1 year (10.2% vs. 14.0%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.34).\nAmong the cases captured by the Medicare database, catheter ablation of VT associated with mechanical support using PVAD was associated with reduced in-hospital cardiogenic shock, renal failure, length of stay, hospital re-admissions and mortality, but no difference in redo-VT ablation at 1 year.
