Future reward\/punishment expectations depend upon the process of decision making in the frontal lobe, which is considered to play an important role in executive function. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between autonomic responses and decision making during reinforcement tasks using sympathetic skin responses (SSR).\nNine adult and 9 juvenile (mean age, 10.2years) volunteers were enrolled in this study. SSRs were measured during the Markov decision task (MDT), which is a reinforcement task. In this task, subjects must endure a small immediate loss to ultimately get a large reward. The subjects had to undergo three sets of tests and their scores in these tests were assessed and evaluated.\nAll adults showed gradually increasing scores for the MDT from the first to third set. As the trial progressed from the first to second set in adults, SSR appearance ratios remarkably increased for both punishment and reward expectations. In comparison with adults, children showed decreasing scores from the first to second set. There were no significant inter-target differences in the SSR appearance ratio in the first and second set in children. In the third set, the SSR appearance ratio for reward expectations was higher than that in the neutral condition.\nIn reinforcement tasks, such as MDT, autonomic responses play an important role in decision making. We assume that SSRs are elicited during efficient decision making tasks associated with future reward\/punishment expectations, which demonstrates the importance of autonomic function. In contrast, in children around the age of 10years, the autonomic system does not react as an organized response specific to reward\/punishment expectations. This suggests the immaturity of the future reward\/punishment expectations process in children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002425","authors":["Hiromi Hosaka","Kakuro Aoyagi","Yoshimi Kaga","Hideaki Kanemura","Kanji Sugita","Masao Aihara"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.braindev.2017.03.004","first_seen_on":"2017-04-06T20:43:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03877604","1872-7131"],"journal":"Brain & Development","last_mentioned_on":1491568735,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28377150?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28377150","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","pediatrics"],"title":"Developmental changes in autonomic responses are associated with future reward\/punishment expectations: A study of sympathetic skin responses in the Markov decision task","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developmental-changes-autonomic-responses-associated-future-rewardpunishment-expectations-study-symp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8147915,"mean":6.9024628625127,"rank":6188119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1095490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8147915,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240128,"mean":13.024618189541,"rank":171753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240128,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":616,"mean":2.2251902439024,"rank":396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":616,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.5097826086957,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedNeurBriefs\/statuses\/850086498049433601","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18564077],"posted_on":"2017-04-06T20:43:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Ped Neurology Briefs","url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricneurologybriefs.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763925960097800192\/QpZJcQcD_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric Neurology Briefs (PNB) is the leading journal review focusing on child neurology since 1987. #OpenAccess on #PubMed & #PubMedCentral.","id_on_source":"PedNeurBriefs","tweeter_id":"759957720","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":2024},"tweet_id":"850086498049433601"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dr_hodgkin\/statuses\/850327024023597057","license":"gnip","rt":["PedNeurBriefs"],"citation_ids":[18564077],"posted_on":"2017-04-07T12:38:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Serkan KIRIK","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891718946218553344\/MVkPLFBm_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"dr_hodgkin","tweeter_id":"74271990","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":295},"tweet_id":"850327024023597057"}]}}
