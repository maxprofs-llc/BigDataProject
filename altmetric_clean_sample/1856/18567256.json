As a key component of the approach, AR training camps provide intensive, goal-oriented, intentional, group-based, customised training and peer-support opportunities in a community environment for individuals with spinal cord injury.\nProspective cross-sectional study.\nTo describe the profile of the organisations that use components of the AR approach, and to explore the characteristics and the international variations of the approach.\nTwenty-two organisations from 21 countries from Europe, Asia and Africa reported using components of the AR approach during the past 10 years.\nAn electronic survey was developed and distributed through a personalised email. Sampling involved a prospective identification of organisations that met the inclusion criteria and snowball strategies.\nWhile there were many collaborating links between the organisations, RG Active Rehabilitation from Sweden and Motivation Charitable Trust from the United Kingdom were identified as key supporting organisations. The 10 key elements of the AR approach were found to be used uniformly across the participating organisations. Small variations were associated with variations in country income and key supporting organisation.\nThis is the first study to describe the key elements and international variations of the AR approach. This will provide the basis for further studies exploring the effectiveness of the approach, it will likely facilitate international collaboration on research and operational aspects and it could potentially support higher integration in the health-care system and long-term funding of these programmes.Spinal Cord advance online publication, 4 April 2017; doi:10.1038\/sc.2017.28.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a6","authors":["Divanoglou, A","Tasiemski, T","Augutis, M","Trok, K"],"doi":"10.1038\/sc.2017.28","first_seen_on":"2017-04-07T00:28:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1362-4393","1476-5624"],"journal":"Spinal Cord","last_mentioned_on":1495175697,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/sc201728.epdf?author_access_token=C2tpAG56pxnw0wmFRJFvPdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O4c2VGP6zAypQK7aB09KRYuMDoIQMM-s8f9lqevwMiiI1CahHK7KC8sVjgM380-9u4j8pQrnwRFwFcrsQHB49a"],"pmid":"28374811","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Rehabilitation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Patient education","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Quality of life","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Active Rehabilitation\u2014a community peer-based approach for persons with spinal cord injury: international utilisation of key elements","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/active-rehabilitationa-community-peerbased-approach-persons-spinal-cord-injury-international-utilisa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.4,"score_history":{"1y":4.4,"6m":4.4,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":1743524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6481515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242831,"mean":13.126576815056,"rank":70126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":172501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242831,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1026,"mean":4.6998926829268,"rank":385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1026,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.00625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
