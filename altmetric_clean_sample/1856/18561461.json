Thematic content analysis was applied using MaxQDA 12 software.\nMigrant and non-migrant adult patients with far advanced, life-limiting disease receiving palliative care in different specialist level settings (specialist home palliative care, palliative care inpatient unit, inpatient hospice).\nThe 37 interviewees (19 native Germans and 18 patients from Europe and the U.S., Israel, Turkey, and Indonesia) expressed eleven themes covering health care- and patient-related issues, of which four emerged to be specific for migrants: worse survival in home country; the perception of an altered identity and 'not belonging'; language skills as prerequisite to survive; and longing for 'home' while being attached to Germany. From these categories, three overarching themes were derived: (1) a limited understanding of the concept of 'palliative care'; (2) the suppression of end of life discussions for its association with suffering and loss of autonomy; and (3) the significance of complex individual migration histories.\nBased on these findings, the concept of a 'double home' experience is proposed. Barriers to access to palliative care should be minimized for all patients while cultural stereotyping has to be avoided.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Piret Paal","Johannes B\u00fckki","Paal, Piret","B\u00fckki, Johannes"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0175314","first_seen_on":"2017-04-06T18:05:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1504864955,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0175314&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28384309?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0175314"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0175314&type=printable","pmid":"28384309","pubdate":"2017-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0175314","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"\u201cIf I had stayed back home, I would not be alive any more\u2026\u201d \u2013 Exploring end-of-life preferences in patients with migration background","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/i-stayed-back-home-i-not-alive-more-exploring-endoflife-preferences-patients-migration-background"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":4.55,"6m":4.55,"3m":3.3,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386234,"mean":7.0650459988331,"rank":1756950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6621387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386234,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249475,"mean":13.052535310292,"rank":70656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":178357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249475,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115742,"mean":10.633468572071,"rank":31067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":84579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115742,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4603,"mean":10.407564537158,"rank":1229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":3370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4603,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
