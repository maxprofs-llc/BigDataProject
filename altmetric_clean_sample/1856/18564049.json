An important aspect of the biology of dying is the identification of biomarkers as indices of disease processes. Biomarkers have the potential to inform the current, limited understanding of the dying process and assist clinicians in recognising dying, in particular how to distinguish dying from reversible acute deterioration.\nTo critically appraise the literature on biological factors that may be used as prognostic indicators in advanced cancer patients and to identify candidate biomarkers of the dying process that can be measured serially in cancer patients' bodily fluids.\nA systematically structured review was conducted using three electronic databases. A hand search of six peer-reviewed journals and conference abstracts was also conducted. Studies reporting prognostic biomarkers in cancer patients with a median survival of \u226490 days and post-mortem studies were included. Final levels of evidence and recommendations were made using the Evidence Based Medicine modified GRADE system.\n30 articles were included. Seven prognostic biological factors demonstrated Grade A evidence (lymphocyte count, white blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein, albumin, sodium, urea and alkaline phosphatase). An additional eleven prognostic factors were identified with Grade B evidence (platelet count, international normalised ratio, serum vitamin B12, prealbumin, bilirubin, cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, pseudocholinesterase and urate). A number of biomarkers were specifically identified in the last two weeks of life but limitations exist. No post-mortem studies met the inclusion criteria.\nThe biology of dying is an important area for future research, with the evidence focused on signs, symptoms and prognostic factors. This review identifies a number of common themes shared amongst advanced cancer patients and highlights candidate biomarkers which may be indicative of a common biological process to dying.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Victoria Louise Reid","Rachael McDonald","Amara Callistus Nwosu","Stephen R.
