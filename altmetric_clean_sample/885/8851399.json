The AhR is widely known as a mediator of dioxin toxicity; however, it also suppresses cancer cell proliferation and recent findings have implicated its role as a tumor suppressor. We conducted a chemical library screen to identify nontoxic AhR ligands with anti-cancer effects and discovered flutamide (Eulexin) as a putative AhR ligand. Flutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of prostate cancer. We found that flutamide inhibited the growth of several cancer cell lines independent of AR status, and that suppression of AhR expression reversed the anti-proliferative effects of flutamide. We investigated the AhR-dependent mechanism of action of flutamide in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and identified that transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is induced by flutamide in an AhR-dependent manner. In contrast, the potent AhR agonist 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin had no effect on TGF-\u03b21 expression, indicating the ligand specificity of AhR activation. We also determined that TGF-\u03b21 induction is required for the AhR-dependent growth inhibitory effects of flutamide. Therefore, flutamide may be effective in AhR-positive cancers that are sensitive to TGF-\u03b21 signaling, such as hepatocellular carcinoma.Oncogene advance online publication, 13 April 2015; doi:10.1038\/onc.2015.55.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","authors":["D C Koch","H S Jang","E F O'Donnell","S Punj","P R Kopparapu","W H Bisson","N I Kerkvliet","S K Kolluri","Koch, D C","Jang, H S","O'Donnell, E F","Punj, S","Kopparapu, P R","Bisson, W H","Kerkvliet, N I","Kolluri, S K"],"doi":"10.1038\/onc.2015.55","endpage":"6104","first_seen_on":"2016-06-18T05:44:19+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1476-5594","0950-9232"],"issue":"50","journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1466213839,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/onc.2015.55","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25867062"],"pmid":"25867062","pubdate":"2015-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cancer","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"6092","subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"Anti-androgen flutamide suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor mediated induction of transforming growth factor-\u03b21","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiandrogen-flutamide-suppresses-hepatocellular-carcinoma-cell-proliferation-via-aryl-hydrocarbon-r-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7912542,"mean":6.6949158185663,"rank":1948885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4874524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7912542,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263161,"mean":11.527374669402,"rank":83776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":175537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263161,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4172,"mean":4.1700167825461,"rank":850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4172,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":10.42636036036,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
