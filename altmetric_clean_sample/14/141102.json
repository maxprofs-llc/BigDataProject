These organisms were formerly thought to be ancient eukaryotes that diverged before introns originated, or at least became common. Now however, they are thought to be members of a supergroup known as excavates, whose members generally appear to have low densities of canonical introns. Here we have used environmental expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing to identify 17 genes from the uncultivable oxymonad Streblomastix strix, to survey intron densities in this most poorly studied excavate group.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b5","authors":["Claudio H Slamovits","Patrick J Keeling"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2148-6-34","issns":["1471-2148"],"journal":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1147651200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16638131","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1501061"],"pmid":"16638131","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"A high density of ancient spliceosomal introns in oxymonad excavates","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-density-ancient-spliceosomal-introns-oxymonad-excavates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3931246,"mean":5.0178691345573,"rank":2186259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1019056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3931246,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2967680,"mean":5.4982616509667,"rank":1623631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":801688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2967680,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1248,"mean":6.9098636728148,"rank":846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1248,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1138,"mean":7.2364978012313,"rank":752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1138,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
