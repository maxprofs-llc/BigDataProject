The nuclear envelope can store Ca(2+) and release it into the nucleus via either the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) or the ryanodine receptor (RyR). Furthermore, many cell types have a reticular network within their nuclei and InsP3Rs on this nucleoplasmic reticulum permit local subnuclear control of Ca(2+) signals and Ca(2+)-dependent intranuclear events. However, it is unknown whether RyR similarly is expressed on the nucleoplasmic reticulum and can control subnuclear Ca(2+) signals. Here we report that the type 1 RyR is expressed on intranuclear extensions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of C2C12 cells, a skeletal muscle derived cell line. In addition, two-photon photorelease of caged Ca(2+) in the region of the nucleoplasmic reticulum evoked Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) within the nucleus, which could be suppressed by the RyR inhibitor dantrolene. These results show that intranuclear extensions of the nuclear envelope have functional RyR and provide a possible mechanism whereby cells expressing RyR can regulate Ca(2+) signals in discrete regions within the nucleus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e16","authors":["Phedra Marius","Mateus T Guerra","Michael H Nathanson","Barbara E Ehrlich","M Fatima Leite"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ceca.2005.09.010","issns":["0143-4160"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cell Calcium","last_mentioned_on":1137974400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16289270"],"pmid":"16289270","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"Calcium release from ryanodine receptors in the nucleoplasmic reticulum.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calcium-release-ryanodine-receptors-nucleoplasmic-reticulum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":2016742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":937381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726798,"mean":5.2256027309729,"rank":1476904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":742397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726798,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165,"mean":1.7270243902439,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":1.6352361111111,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
