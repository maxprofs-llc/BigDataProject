Herein, we describe previously uncharacterized nucleosome binding properties of PARP-1 that promote the formation of compact, transcriptionally repressed chromatin structures. PARP-1 binds in a specific manner to nucleosomes and modulates chromatin structure through NAD+-dependent automodification, without modifying core histones or promoting the disassembly of nucleosomes. The automodification activity of PARP-1 is potently stimulated by nucleosomes, causing the release of PARP-1 from chromatin. The NAD+-dependent activities of PARP-1 are reversed by PARG, a poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, and are inhibited by ATP. In vivo, PARP-1 incorporation is associated with transcriptionally repressed chromatin domains that are spatially distinct from both histone H1-repressed domains and actively transcribed regions. Thus, PARP-1 functions both as a structural component of chromatin and a modulator of chromatin structure through its intrinsic enzymatic activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","doi":"10.1016\/j.cell.2004.11.002","issns":["0092-8674"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1103587200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15607977","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cell.2004.11.002"],"pmid":"15607977","pubdate":"2004-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"NAD+-dependent modulation of chromatin structure and transcription by nucleosome binding properties of PARP-1.","type":"article","volume":"119","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/naddependent-modulation-chromatin-structure-transcription-nucleosome-binding-properties-parp1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627916,"mean":4.9454584244709,"rank":2017879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":933896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627916,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726145,"mean":5.2306810117174,"rank":1477724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":739679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726145,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7728,"mean":10.635160864501,"rank":5687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7728,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6208,"mean":9.7265922345739,"rank":4349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6208,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Researcher":31,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
