Mutational studies defined residues of MA critical for the interaction, and tests of viruses carrying MA mutations revealed a near-perfect correlation between binding and virus replication. The replication-defective mutants showed defects in both early and late stages of the life cycle. Four viable second-site revertant viruses were isolated from three different replication-defective parental mutants, and in all cases the interaction with IQGAP1 was restored by the suppressor mutations. The interaction of MA and IQGAP1 was readily detected in vitro and in vivo. Virus replication was potently inhibited by a C-terminal fragment of IQGAP1, and impaired by RNAi knockdown of IQGAP1 and 2. We suggest that the IQGAPs link the virus to the cytoskeleton for trafficking both into and out of the cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Juliana Leung","Andrew Yueh","Frank S K Appah","Bing Yuan","Kenia de los Santos","Stephen P Goff"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.emboj.7601097","issns":["0261-4189"],"issue":"10","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1150156800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16628219"],"pmid":"16628219","pubdate":"2006-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Interaction of Moloney murine leukemia virus matrix protein with IQGAP.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interaction-moloney-murine-leukemia-virus-matrix-protein-iqgap-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635048,"mean":4.9225817734301,"rank":2018173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635048,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2731495,"mean":5.2133167848654,"rank":1477820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":749090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2731495,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4000,"mean":3.1901505376344,"rank":2505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4000,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2669,"mean":2.7928133433283,"rank":1304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2669,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
