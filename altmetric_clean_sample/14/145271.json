However, it is still not known how these different protein components act together during division. Here we analyse protein-protein interactions between all known stromal plastid division proteins. Using a combination of quantitative yeast two-hybrid assays, in planta co-localization studies, fluorescence resonance energy transfer and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays we show that these proteins do not act in isolation but rather in protein complexes to govern appropriate plastid division. We have previously shown that AtMinD1 forms functional homodimers and we show here that in addition to homodimerization AtMinD1 also interacts with AtMinE1. Furthermore, AtMinE1 has the ability to homodimerize. We also demonstrate that proteins from both FtsZ families (AtFtsZ1-1 and AtFtsZ2-1) not only interact with themselves but also with each other, and we show that these interactions are not dependent on correct Z-ring formation. Further to this we demonstrate that ARC6 specifically interacts with the core domain of AtFtsZ2-1, but not with AtFtsZ1-1, providing in planta evidence for a functional difference between the two FtsZ protein families in plants. Our studies have enabled us to construct a meaningful intraplastidic protein-protein interaction map of all known stromal plastid division proteins in Arabidopsis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003338","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-313x.2005.02493.x","issns":["0960-7412"],"issue":"6","journal":"Plant Journal","last_mentioned_on":1127952000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16146521"],"pmid":"16146521","pubdate":"2005-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Plastid division is mediated by combinatorial assembly of plastid division proteins.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plastid-division-mediated-combinatorial-assembly-plastid-division-proteins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":2015754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727686,"mean":5.2184568452772,"rank":1476116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":745225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727686,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1848,"mean":1.948293448836,"rank":863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1848,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1523,"mean":1.9096846254928,"rank":681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1523,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
