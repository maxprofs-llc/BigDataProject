Although strict tissue- and developmental-stage-specific expression is critical for appropriate miRNA function, mammalian transcription factors that regulate miRNAs have not yet been identified. The proto-oncogene c-MYC encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, growth and apoptosis. Dysregulated expression or function of c-Myc is one of the most common abnormalities in human malignancy. Here we show that c-Myc activates expression of a cluster of six miRNAs on human chromosome 13. Chromatin immunoprecipation experiments show that c-Myc binds directly to this locus. The transcription factor E2F1 is an additional target of c-Myc that promotes cell cycle progression. We find that expression of E2F1 is negatively regulated by two miRNAs in this cluster, miR-17-5p and miR-20a. These findings expand the known classes of transcripts within the c-Myc target gene network, and reveal a mechanism through which c-Myc simultaneously activates E2F1 transcription and limits its translation, allowing a tightly controlled proliferative signal.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2005Natur.435..839O","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","doi":"10.1038\/nature03677","issns":["1476-4687"],"issue":"7043","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1235606400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15944709","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nature03677"],"pmid":"15944709","pubdate":"2005-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"c-Myc-regulated microRNAs modulate E2F1 expression.","type":"article","volume":"435","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cmycregulated-micrornas-modulate-e2f1-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.088,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.088},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":395452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4642087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4034337,"mean":6.7323853035519,"rank":363465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3670836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4034337,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39432,"mean":60.759079505972,"rank":17206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":22224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39432,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38763,"mean":59.842265466178,"rank":16709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":22052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38763,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":56,"Researcher":169,"Student  > Doctoral Student":26,"Student  > Ph.
