Here we show that the sterile alpha motif domain of rat Shank3\/ProSAP2, a master scaffolding protein located deep within the PSD, can form large sheets composed of helical fibers stacked side by side. Zn2+, which is found in high concentrations in the PSD, binds tightly to Shank3 and may regulate assembly. Sheets of the Shank protein could form a platform for the construction of the PSD complex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006Sci...311..531B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Marisa K Baron","Tobias M Boeckers","Bianca Vaida","Salem Faham","Mari Gingery","Michael R Sawaya","Danielle Salyer","Eckart D Gundelfinger","James U Bowie"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1118995","issns":["1095-9203"],"issue":"5760","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1245576060,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16439662"],"pmid":"16439662","pubdate":"2006-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"An architectural framework that may lie at the core of the postsynaptic density.","type":"article","volume":"311","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/architectural-framework-lie-core-postsynaptic-density"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":680471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2926950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2728596,"mean":5.2141058339588,"rank":553817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2153660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2728596,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27896,"mean":20.975905932963,"rank":13692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":13494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27896,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23302,"mean":24.095698982876,"rank":13353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":9257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23302,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
