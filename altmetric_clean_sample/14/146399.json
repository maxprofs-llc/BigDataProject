Recently, a variant in the human bdnf gene, resulting in a valine to methionine substitution in the prodomain, has been shown to lead to defective regulated secretion from neurons and memory impairment. Here, we report a novel function for a Vps10p domain protein, sortilin, in controlling BDNF sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. Sortilin interacts specifically with BDNF in a region encompassing the methionine substitution and colocalizes with BDNF in secretory granules in neurons. A truncated form of sortilin causes BDNF missorting to the constitutive secretory pathway without affecting neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) secretion. In addition, sortilin small interfering RNA introduced into primary neurons also led to BDNF missorting from the regulated to the constitutive secretory pathway. Together, these data suggest a mechanism to understand the defect associated with variant BDNF and provide a framework, based on divergent presynaptic regulation of sorting to secretory pathways, to explain how two ligands for tropomyosin-related kinase B, BDNF and NT-4, can mediate diverse biological responses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.1017-05.2005","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"26","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1292050551,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15987945","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1201519"],"pmid":"15987945","pubdate":"2005-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Soc Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Sortilin Controls Intracellular Sorting of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor to the Regulated Secretory Pathway","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sortilin-controls-intracellular-sorting-brainderived-neurotrophic-factor-regulated-secretory-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631265,"mean":4.9266893682253,"rank":680456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2927034,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631265,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2728639,"mean":5.2138060798137,"rank":553809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2153716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2728639,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9098,"mean":6.1142112784435,"rank":2212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9098,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8456,"mean":6.325814547605,"rank":2187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":6165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8456,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":32,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
