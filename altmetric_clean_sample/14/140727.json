One of the first of these was identified in the intergenic region between the Dlx-5 and Dlx-6 genes, members of the Dlx\/dll homeodomain-containing protein family. In previous experiments, we showed that Sonic hedgehog treatment of forebrain neural explants results in the activation of Dlx-2 and the novel noncoding RNA (ncRNA), Evf-1. In this report, we show that the Dlx-5\/6 ultraconserved region is transcribed to generate an alternatively spliced form of Evf-1, the ncRNA Evf-2. Evf-2 specifically cooperates with Dlx-2 to increase the transcriptional activity of the Dlx-5\/6 enhancer in a target and homeodomain-specific manner. A stable complex containing the Evf-2 ncRNA and the Dlx-2 protein forms in vivo, suggesting that the Evf-2 ncRNA activates transcriptional activity by directly influencing Dlx-2 activity. These experiments identify a novel mechanism whereby transcription is controlled by the cooperative actions of an ncRNA and a homeodomain protein. The possibility that a subset of vertebrate ultraconserved regions may function at both the DNA and RNA level to control key developmental regulators may explain why ultraconserved sequences exhibit 90% or more conservation even after 450 million years of vertebrate evolution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["Jianchi Feng","Chunming Bi","Brian S Clark","Rina Mady","Palak Shah","Jhumku D Kohtz"],"doi":"10.1101\/gad.1416106","issns":["0890-9369","1549-5477"],"issue":"11","journal":"Genes & Development","last_mentioned_on":1362137690,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16705037","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1475760","http:\/\/www.genesdev.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16705037"],"pmid":"16705037","pubdate":"2006-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The Evf-2 noncoding RNA is transcribed from the Dlx-5\/6 ultraconserved region and functions as a Dlx-2 transcriptional coactivator","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evf2-noncoding-rna-transcribed-dlx56-ultraconserved-region-functions-dlx2-transcriptional-coactivato"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3909012,"mean":5.014618567295,"rank":743048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3138327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3909012,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2951738,"mean":5.4847184266592,"rank":615259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2311240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2951738,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2634,"mean":3.0698418250951,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2634,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1837,"mean":2.9282487725041,"rank":249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1837,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Researcher":67,"Student  > Ph.
