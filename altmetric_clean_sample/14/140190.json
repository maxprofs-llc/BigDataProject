After skin wounding, the receptor was activated by heparin-binding epidermal growth factor that was released by a metalloprotease-dependent mechanism. Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor generated antimicrobial concentrations of human beta-defensin-3 and increased the activity of organotypic epidermal cultures against Staphylococcus aureus. These data demonstrate that sterile wounding initiates an innate immune response that increases resistance to overt infection and microbial colonization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cff","authors":["Ole E S\u00f8rensen","Dharma R Thapa","K Markus Roup\u00e9","Erika V Valore","Ulf Sj\u00f6bring","Alice A Roberts","Artur Schmidtchen","Tomas Ganz"],"doi":"10.1172\/jci28422","issns":["0021-9738"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1150761600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16778986","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1479426"],"pmid":"16778986","pubdate":"2006-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Clinical Investigation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Injury-induced innate immune response in human skin mediated by transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor","type":"article","volume":"116","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/injuryinduced-innate-immune-response-human-skin-mediated-transactivation-epidermal-growth-factor-rec-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4409947,"mean":4.8306983503683,"rank":2359944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1331227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4409947,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3362275,"mean":5.3830699464349,"rank":1800288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1020901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3362275,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4646,"mean":8.9938385360603,"rank":3053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4646,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3308,"mean":9.3842334442093,"rank":1994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3308,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
