Here we show that the fission yeast ubiquitin-conjugating Rhp6\/Ubc2\/Rad6 and ligating enzymes Ubr1 are responsible for nuclear enrichment of proteasome through the function of Cut8, a nuclear envelope protein. Cut8 is an Rhp6 substrate that physically interacts with and tethers proteasome. Nonubiquitinatable K-all-R Cut8 weakly interacts with proteasome and fails to enrich nuclear proteasome. Consistently, the nuclear enrichment of proteasome also fails in rhp6 and ubr1 null mutants. Further, cut8 null and cut8 K-all-R mutants are hypersensitive to DNA damage, probably due to the paucity of nuclear proteasome. Thus, Rhp6 enhances the retention of nuclear proteasome through regulating Cut8. The short-lived nature of Cut8 is crucial for feedback enrichment of the proteasome within the nucleus. This is likely to be a conserved mechanism as we describe a Cut8 homolog in flies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","doi":"10.1016\/j.cell.2005.05.023","issns":["0092-8674"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1124409600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16096059"],"pmid":"16096059","pubdate":"2005-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Regulation of nuclear proteasome by Rhp6\/Ubc2 through ubiquitination and destruction of the sensor and anchor Cut8.","type":"article","volume":"122","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-nuclear-proteasome-rhp6ubc2-through-ubiquitination-destruction-sensor-anchor-cut8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":2015458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2728395,"mean":5.2159293452523,"rank":1475912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":746820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2728395,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7728,"mean":10.60302963634,"rank":5687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7728,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6211,"mean":9.7510305958132,"rank":4352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6211,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Ph.
