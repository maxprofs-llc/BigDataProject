Sexual lines were transferred by many zygotes or by a single zygote in each sexual generation. By the end of the experiment zygote production was in the order sexual mass-transfer>sexual single-zygote>asexual>ancestor. The direct response to sexual selection was large, with zygote production increasing by about two orders of magnitude, mainly because mating had become spontaneous instead of being invoked by nitrogen starvation. Asexual lines became sexually sterilized by the fixation of a single mating type. Sexual selection caused a radical shift in the gender system, with homothallism spreading to high frequency in all sexual lines of this normally heterothallic species. This may have been caused by the transposition of a mating-type gene to an autosome. No substantial degree of environment-specific mating evolved, however, and thus no sexual isolation indicative of incipient speciation. It is possible that selection experiments of this kind are unlikely to induce sexual isolation because mating-type genes evolve in a saltatory fashion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002d93","doi":"10.1111\/j.1420-9101.2004.00830.x","issns":["1010-061X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1116547200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15842501"],"pmid":"15842501","pubdate":"2005-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Experimental sexual selection in Chlamydomonas.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/experimental-sexual-selection-chlamydomonas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":2017784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726331,"mean":5.2303532859219,"rank":1477662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":740099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726331,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":979,"mean":4.6750224948875,"rank":644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":979,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":768,"mean":4.3852542372881,"rank":481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":768,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
