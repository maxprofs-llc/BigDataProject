Here we describe a genomic screen for adaptive insertions of transposable elements in Drosophila. Using a pilot application of this screen, we have identified an adaptive transposable element insertion, which truncates a gene and apparently generates a functional protein in the process. The insertion of this transposable element confers increased resistance to an organophosphate pesticide and has spread in D. melanogaster recently.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2005Sci...309..764A","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Yael T.
