FRET-based approaches have enabled otherwise intractable measurements of molecular concentrations, binding interactions and catalytic activity, but are limited by the dynamic range and sensitivity of the donor-acceptor pair. To address this problem, we applied a quantitative evolutionary strategy using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to optimize a cyan-yellow fluorescent protein pair for FRET. The resulting pair, CyPet-YPet, exhibited a 20-fold ratiometric FRET signal change, as compared to threefold for the parental pair. The optimized FRET pair enabled high-throughput flow cytometric screening of cells undergoing caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. The CyPet-YPet energy transfer pair provides substantially improved sensitivity and dynamic range for a broad range of molecular imaging and screening applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003162","authors":["Annalee W Nguyen","Patrick S Daugherty"],"doi":"10.1038\/nbt1066","issns":["1087-0156","1546-1696"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nature Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1445856732,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15696158","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nbt1066","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nbt\/journal\/v23\/n3\/full\/nbt1066.html"],"pmid":"15696158","pubdate":"2005-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Niemeyer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Evolutionary optimization of fluorescent proteins for intracellular FRET","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolutionary-optimization-fluorescent-proteins-intracellular-fret"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.596,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.596},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6491271,"mean":5.9704270061169,"rank":431270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":6060052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6491271,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5562274,"mean":6.5341622113834,"rank":410771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":5151487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5562274,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3496,"mean":20.30151702432,"rank":985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":2511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3496,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3480,"mean":21.13858522564,"rank":980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":2500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3480,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":40,"Researcher":147,"Student  > Doctoral Student":15,"Student  > Ph.
