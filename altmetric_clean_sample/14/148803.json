In some cases, reactants are difficult or impossible to tether to DNA oligonucleotides. The development of strategies that enable non-DNA linked small-molecule reagents to participate in sequence-programmed synthesis therefore would significantly expand the capabilities of DTS. We developed efficient DNA-templated functional group transformations of template-linked azides into corresponding amines, carboxylic acids, and thiols. The application of these reactions to a single-solution mixture of four template-linked organic azides enabled each azide to be transformed sequence specifically into a sulfonamide, carbamate, urea, or thiourea using small-molecule sulfonyl chloride, chloroformate, isocyanate, or isothiocyanate reagents not tethered to DNA. Only the four desired products were observed, without formation of any of the 12 possible undesired cross-products. Our results represent a new approach to small molecule diversification in a DNA-programmed manner.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Sakurai K","Snyder TM","Liu DR","Kaori Sakurai","Thomas M.
