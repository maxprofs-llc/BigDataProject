The cardiac gap-junction protein connexin 40 is expressed selectively in atrial myocytes and mediates the coordinated electrical activation of the atria. We hypothesized that idiopathic atrial fibrillation has a genetic basis and that tissue-specific mutations in GJA5, the gene encoding connexin 40, may predispose the atria to fibrillation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031c4","authors":["Michael H Gollob","Douglas L Jones","Andrew D Krahn","Lynne Danis","Xiang-Qun Gong","Qing Shao","Xiaoqin Liu","John P Veinot","Anthony S L Tang","Alexandre F R Stewart","Frederique Tesson","George J Klein","Raymond Yee","Allan C Skanes","Gerard M Guiraudon","Lisa Ebihara","Donglin Bai"],"doi":"10.1056\/nejmoa052800","issns":["1533-4406"],"issue":"25","journal":"New England Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1273660450,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16790700"],"pmid":"16790700","pubdate":"2006-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Somatic mutations in the connexin 40 gene (GJA5) in atrial fibrillation.","type":"article","volume":"354","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/somatic-mutations-connexin-40-gene-gja5-atrial-fibrillation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632901,"mean":4.9227823810231,"rank":680271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2929030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632901,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2729520,"mean":5.2115241447341,"rank":553747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2154676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2729520,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12375,"mean":25.598809600776,"rank":6305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":5876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12375,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12365,"mean":25.615277418311,"rank":6302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":5869,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12365,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
