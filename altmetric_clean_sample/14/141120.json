This deficiency is compensated for by the import of a small fraction of nearly all of its cytosolic tRNAs. Most trypanosomal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are encoded by single-copy genes, suggesting the use of the same enzyme in the cytosol and mitochondrion. However, the T. brucei genome contains two distinct genes for eukaryotic tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS). RNA interference analysis established that both TrpRS1 and TrpRS2 are essential for growth and required for cytosolic and mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA formation, respectively. Decoding the mitochondrial tryptophan codon UGA requires mitochondria-specific C-->U RNA editing in the anticodon of the imported tRNA(Trp). In vitro charging assays with recombinant TrpRS enzymes demonstrated that the edited anticodon and the mitochondria-specific thiolation of U33 in the imported tRNA(Trp) act as antideterminants for the cytosolic TrpRS1. The existence of two TrpRS enzymes, therefore, can be explained by the need for a mitochondrial synthetase with extended substrate specificity to achieve aminoacylation of the imported thiolated and edited tRNA(Trp). Thus, the notion that, in an organism, all nuclear-encoded tRNAs assigned to a given amino acid are charged by a single aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, is not universally valid.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006PNAS..103.6847C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Fabien Charri\u00e8re","Sunna Helgad\u00f3ttir","Elke K Horn","Dieter S\u00f6ll","Andr\u00e9 Schneider"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0602362103","issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"18","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1147996800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16636268"],"pmid":"16636268","pubdate":"2006-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Dual targeting of a single tRNA(Trp) requires two different tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases in Trypanosoma brucei.","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dual-targeting-single-trnatrp-requires-two-different-tryptophanyltrna-synthetases-trypanosoma-brucei"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2018738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2724808,"mean":5.2344478680531,"rank":1477961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2724808,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33570,"mean":13.677826566177,"rank":23250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33570,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26601,"mean":16.480717593985,"rank":17060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":3683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26601,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
