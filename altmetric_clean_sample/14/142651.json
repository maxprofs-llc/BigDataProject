We found that rats trained on an odor-localization task can localize odors accurately in one or two sniffs. Bilateral sampling was essential for accurate odor localization, with internasal intensity and timing differences as directional cues. If the stimulus arrived at the correct point of the respiration cycle, internasal timing differences as short as 50 milliseconds sufficed. Neuronal recordings show that bulbar neurons responded differentially to stimuli from the left and stimuli from the right.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006Sci...311..666R","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Raghav Rajan","James P Clement","Upinder S Bhalla","James P.
