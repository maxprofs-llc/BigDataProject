We have previously identified a motif called the evening element (EE) that is overrepresented in the promoters of evening-phased genes. Here, we demonstrate that multimerized EEs are necessary and sufficient to confer evening-phased circadian regulation. Although flanking sequences are not required for EE function, they can modulate EE activity. One flanking sequence, taken from the PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR 9 promoter, itself confers dawn-phased rhythms and has allowed us to define a new clock promoter motif (the morning element [ME]). Scanning mutagenesis reveals that both activators and repressors of gene expression act through the ME and EE. Although our experiments confirm that CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) are likely to act as repressors via the EE, they also show that they have an unexpected positive effect on EE-mediated gene expression as well. We have identified a clock-regulated activity in plant extracts that binds specifically to the EE and has a phase consistent with it being an activator of expression through the EE. This activity is reduced in CCA1\/LHY null plants, suggesting it may itself be part of a circadian feedback loop and perhaps explaining the reduction in EE activity in these double mutant plants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003335","doi":"10.1105\/tpc.105.033035","issns":["1040-4651"],"issue":"7","journal":"Plant Cell","last_mentioned_on":1120003200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15923346"],"pmid":"15923346","pubdate":"2005-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Positive and negative factors confer phase-specific circadian regulation of transcription in Arabidopsis.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-negative-factors-confer-phasespecific-circadian-regulation-transcription-arabidopsis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635017,"mean":4.9194226118571,"rank":2016789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635017,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2731417,"mean":5.2090158280748,"rank":1476709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":750227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2731417,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1916,"mean":2.5719676240209,"rank":905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1916,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1477,"mean":2.0983333333333,"rank":540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1477,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
