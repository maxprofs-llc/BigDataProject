However, G-CSF fails to mobilize sufficient numbers of stem cells in up to 10% of donors, precluding autologous transplantation in those donors or substantially delaying transplant recovery time. Consequently, new regimens are needed to increase the number of stem cells in peripheral blood upon mobilization. Using a forward genetic approach in mice, we mapped the gene encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) to a genetic region modifying G-CSF-mediated HSPC mobilization. Amounts of EGFR in HSPCs inversely correlated with the cells' ability to be mobilized by G-CSF, implying a negative role for EGFR signaling in mobilization. In combination with G-CSF treatment, genetic reduction of EGFR activity in HSPCs (in waved-2 mutant mice) or treatment with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib increased mobilization. Increased mobilization due to suppression of EGFR activity correlated with reduced activity of cell division control protein-42 (Cdc42), and genetic Cdc42 deficiency in vivo also enhanced G-CSF-induced mobilization. Our findings reveal a previously unknown signaling pathway regulating stem cell mobilization and provide a new pharmacological approach for improving HSPC mobilization and thereby transplantation outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003166","doi":"10.1038\/nm.2217","issns":["1546-170X"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nature Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1344176058,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20871610"],"pmid":"20871610","pubdate":"2010-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","medicine"],"title":"Pharmacological inhibition of EGFR signaling enhances G-CSF-induced hematopoietic stem cell mobilization.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacological-inhibition-egfr-signaling-enhances-gcsfinduced-hematopoietic-stem-cell-mobilization-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":1840986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2854535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3623609,"mean":6.2499317475675,"rank":1483379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2112847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3623609,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3790,"mean":16.699371865928,"rank":2721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3790,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3783,"mean":16.830803807509,"rank":2719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3783,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
