In chondrichthyans, the electrosensory system is composed of a cephalic network of ampullary organs, known as the ampullae of Lorenzini, that can detect extremely weak electric fields during hunting and navigation. Each ampullary organ consists of a gel-filled epidermal pit containing sensory hair cells, and synaptic connections with primary afferent neurons at the base of the pit that facilitate detection of voltage gradients over large regions of the body. The developmental origin of electroreceptors and the mechanisms that determine their spatial arrangement in the vertebrate head are not well understood. We have analyzed electroreceptor development in the lesser spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and show that Sox8 and HNK1, two markers of the neural crest lineage, selectively mark sensory cells in ampullary organs. This represents the first evidence that the neural crest gives rise to electrosensory cells. We also show that pathfinding by cephalic mechanosensory and electrosensory axons follows the expression pattern of EphA4, a well-known guidance cue for axons and neural crest cells in osteichthyans. Expression of EphrinB2, which encodes a ligand for EphA4, marks the positions at which ampullary placodes are initiated in the epidermis, and EphA4 is expressed in surrounding mesenchyme. These results suggest that Eph-Ephrin signaling may establish an early molecular map for neural crest migration, axon guidance and placodal morphogenesis during development of the shark electrosensory system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002884","authors":["Renata Freitas","Guangjun Zhang","James S Albert","David H Evans","Martin J Cohn","Freitas, Renata","Zhang, GuangJun","Albert, James S.","Evans, David H.","Cohn, Martin J."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1525-142x.2006.05076.x","endpage":"80","issns":["1520-541X","1525-142X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Evolution & Development","last_mentioned_on":1380920282,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16409384","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1525-142X.2006.05076.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1525-142X.2006.05076.x\/pdf","pmid":"16409384","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Science Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"74","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Developmental origin of shark electrosensory organs.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developmental-origin-shark-electrosensory-organs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4249983,"mean":5.1322894703445,"rank":2135378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1897894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4249983,"percentile":44},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3228974,"mean":5.7023040544252,"rank":1614047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1462185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3228974,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290,"mean":3.6007266435986,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232,"mean":3.9738528138528,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
