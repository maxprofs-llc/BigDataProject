Upon IL-3 withdrawal, protein levels of MCL-1 decreased but were sustained by pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3, which prevented cytochrome c release and apoptosis. MCL-1 was phosphorylated by GSK-3 at a conserved GSK-3 phosphorylation site (S159). S159 phosphorylation of MCL-1 was induced by IL-3 withdrawal or PI3K inhibition and prevented by AKT or inhibition of GSK-3, and it led to increased ubiquitinylation and degradation of MCL-1. A phosphorylation-site mutant (MCL-1(S159A)), expressed in IL-3-dependent cells, showed enhanced stability upon IL-3 withdrawal and conferred increased protection from apoptosis compared to wild-type MCL-1. The results demonstrate that the control of MCL-1 stability by GSK-3 is an important mechanism for the regulation of apoptosis by growth factors, PI3K, and AKT.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","authors":["Ulrich Maurer","C\u00e9line Charvet","Allan S Wagman","Emmanuel Dejardin","Douglas R Green"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molcel.2006.02.009","issns":["1097-2765"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1145923200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16543145"],"pmid":"16543145","pubdate":"2006-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 regulates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and apoptosis by destabilization of MCL-1.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glycogen-synthase-kinase3-regulates-mitochondrial-outer-membrane-permeabilization-apoptosis-destabil-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626939,"mean":4.9512885298875,"rank":2018683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626939,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2724869,"mean":5.2341726168043,"rank":1477930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2724869,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3051,"mean":4.0870786885246,"rank":1742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3051,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2265,"mean":3.6187871024735,"rank":1047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2265,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
