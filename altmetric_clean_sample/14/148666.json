A miniaturized thermal denaturation assay was used to screen chemical libraries, resulting in the discovery of a novel series of benzodiazepinedione antagonists of the HDM2-p53 interaction. The X-ray crystal structure of improved antagonists bound to HDM2 reveals their alpha-helix mimetic properties. These optimized molecules increase the transcription of p53 target genes and decrease proliferation of tumor cells expressing wild-type p53.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Grasberger BL","Lu T","Schubert C","Parks DJ","Carver TE","Koblish HK","Cummings MD","LaFrance LV","Milkiewicz KL","Calvo RR","Maguire D","Lattanze J","Franks CF","Zhao S","Ramachandren K","Bylebyl GR","Zhang M","Manthey CL","Petrella EC","Pantoliano MW","Deckman IC","Spurlino JC","Maroney AC","Tomczuk BE","Molloy CJ","Bone RF"],"doi":"10.1021\/jm049137g","endpage":"912","issns":["0022-2623","1520-4804"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1479321219,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15715460","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15715460"],"pmid":"15715460","pubdate":"2005-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"909","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Discovery and cocrystal structure of benzodiazepinedione HDM2 antagonists that activate p53 in cells.","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/discovery-cocrystal-structure-benzodiazepinedione-hdm2-antagonists-activate-p53-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.024,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.024},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700472,"mean":6.6097995325169,"rank":840430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6859915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700472,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7081093,"mean":6.9269045712114,"rank":812587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6268381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7081093,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3855,"mean":4.2405874416191,"rank":324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3855,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3650,"mean":4.3177138942176,"rank":311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3650,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":34,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
