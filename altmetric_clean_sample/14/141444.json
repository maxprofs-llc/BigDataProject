Through chemical mutagenesis of transgenic Arabidopsis expressing Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) MP fused with the green fluorescent protein, we have studied the function of a central region of the MP, defined by a number of conserved cysteine and histidine residues (Cys-His-rich region), which potentially functions as a zinc-binding domain. Transient expression of mutant MPs identified through an in planta screen for altered MP function or constructed with altered putative zinc ligands through site-directed mutagenesis showed that mutations in the Cys-His-rich region affected localization to and trafficking through plasmodesmata. In vitro zinc-binding analysis revealed that wild type (wt) CMV MP had the ability to bind zinc and that movement-defective mutants bound zinc with less affinity than wt MP. Furthermore, a correlation between the association of the MP with plasmodesmata and virus pathogenesis was shown. We discuss roles of the Cys-His region in biochemical and biological functions of the MP during virus movement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003769","authors":["Nobumitsu Sasaki","Jong-Won Park","Andrew J Maule","Richard S Nelson"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.virol.2006.02.035","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0042-6822"],"issue":"2","journal":"Virology","last_mentioned_on":1150329600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16603215"],"pmid":"16603215","pubdate":"2006-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"The cysteine-histidine-rich region of the movement protein of Cucumber mosaic virus contributes to plasmodesmal targeting, zinc binding and pathogenesis.","type":"article","volume":"349","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cysteinehistidinerich-region-movement-protein-cucumber-mosaic-virus-contributes-plasmodesmal-targeti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.9388872667219,"rank":2018135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":930343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2723560,"mean":5.2053423602532,"rank":1477014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":736736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2723560,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1296,"mean":2.9823521235521,"rank":805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1296,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1176,"mean":2.8788544680851,"rank":734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1176,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
