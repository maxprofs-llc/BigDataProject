Caspase-1 activation is an early event in models of Huntington's disease (HD). However, mechanisms regulating the activation of this apical caspase in cell death are not known. Receptor interacting protein-2 (Rip2) and caspase recruitment domain (CARD) only protein (Cop) are two CARD proteins with significant homology to the caspase-1 CARD and modulate caspase-1 activation in inflammation. Rip2 is a caspase-1 activator, and Cop is a caspase-1 inhibitor. We demonstrate in models of HD that caspase-1 activation results from dysregulation of caspase-1 activation pathways. Associated with disease progression, we detect elevation of the caspase-1 activator Rip2 and reduction of the caspase-1 inhibitor Cop. Knocking down endogenous Rip2\/Cop respectively results in reduced\/increased sensitivity to neurotoxic stimuli. Our data provide evidence that caspase-1-mediated cell death is regulated, at least in part, by the balance of Rip2 and Cop, and alterations of this balance may contribute to aberrant caspase-1-mediated pathogenesis in Huntington's disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Xin Wang","Hongyan Wang","Bryan E Figueroa","Wen-Hua Zhang","Chunfeng Huo","Yingjun Guan","Yu Zhang","Jean-Marie Bruey","John C Reed","Robert M Friedlander"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.4181-05.2005","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"50","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1207759500,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16354923"],"pmid":"16354923","pubdate":"2005-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Dysregulation of receptor interacting protein-2 and caspase recruitment domain only protein mediates aberrant caspase-1 activation in Huntington's disease.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dysregulation-receptor-interacting-protein2-caspase-recruitment-domain-only-protein-mediates-aberran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":879668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3601882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3444582,"mean":5.9501142217676,"rank":749559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":2668761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3444582,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10244,"mean":6.8681114907742,"rank":2793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":7290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10244,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9599,"mean":7.1373621587831,"rank":2756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":6683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9599,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
