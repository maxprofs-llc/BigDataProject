However, distinguishing among demographic and selective explanations for patterns of variation observed with HLA genes remains a challenge. In this study we address this issue using data from a diverse set of human populations at six classical HLA loci and, employing a comparative genomics approach, contrast results for HLA loci to those for non-HLA markers. Using a variety of analytic methods, we confirm and extend evidence for selection acting on several HLA loci. We find that allele frequency distributions for four of the six HLA loci deviate from neutral expectations and show that this is unlikely to be explained solely by demographic factors. Other features of HLA variation are explained in part by demographic history, including decreased heterozygosity and increased LD for populations at greater distances from Africa and a similar apportionment of genetic variation for HLA loci compared to putatively neutral non-HLA loci. On the basis of contrasts among different HLA loci and between HLA and non-HLA loci, we conclude that HLA loci bear detectable signatures of both natural selection and demographic history.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002942","authors":["Diogo Meyer","Richard M Single","Steven J Mack","Henry A Erlich","Glenys Thomson"],"doi":"10.1534\/genetics.105.052837","issns":["0016-6731"],"issue":"4","journal":"Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1180915200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16702436"],"pmid":"16702436","pubdate":"2006-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Copyright \u00a9 2006 by the Genetics Society of America","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Signatures of demographic history and natural selection in the human major histocompatibility complex Loci.","type":"article","volume":"173","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/signatures-demographic-history-natural-selection-human-major-histocompatibility-complex-loci-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627846,"mean":4.9453817817504,"rank":2017864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":933975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627846,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726174,"mean":5.2309295712367,"rank":1477714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":739745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726174,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2181,"mean":4.7903596330275,"rank":1263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2181,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1741,"mean":4.3691344827586,"rank":907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1741,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
