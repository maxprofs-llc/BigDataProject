Given their developmental origin from the cranial neural crest, we asked whether this regenerative ability was related to the stem cell-like properties of their neural crest precursors. To this end, we challenged corneal stromal keratocytes by injecting them into a new environment along cranial neural crest migratory pathways. The results show that injected stromal keratocytes change their phenotype, proliferate and migrate ventrally adjacent to host neural crest cells. They then contribute to the corneal endothelial and stromal layers, the musculature of the eye, mandibular process, blood vessels and cardiac cushion tissue of the host. However, they fail to form neurons in cranial ganglia or branchial arch cartilage, illustrating that they are at least partially restricted progenitors rather than stem cells. The data show that, even at late embryonic stages, corneal keratocytes are not terminally differentiated, but maintain plasticity and multipotentiality, contributing to non-neuronal cranial neural crest derivatives.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ee","authors":["Peter Y Lwigale","Paola A Cressy","Marianne Bronner-Fraser"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ydbio.2005.09.046","issns":["0012-1606"],"issue":"1","journal":"Developmental Biology","last_mentioned_on":1133827200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16263107"],"pmid":"16263107","pubdate":"2005-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"Corneal keratocytes retain neural crest progenitor cell properties.","type":"article","volume":"288","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/corneal-keratocytes-retain-neural-crest-progenitor-cell-properties"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":2015950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727504,"mean":5.2200557762942,"rank":1476234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":744674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727504,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1530,"mean":2.0382145192937,"rank":758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1530,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1427,"mean":1.9616269284712,"rank":697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1427,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
