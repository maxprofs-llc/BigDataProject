In Escherichia coli and other related Gram-negative bacteria, high affinity nickel transport depends on proteins expressed by the nik operon. A central actor of this process is the periplasmic NikA transport protein. A previous structural report has proposed that nickel binds to NikA as a pentahydrate species. However, both stereochemical considerations and X-ray absorption spectroscopic results are incompatible with that interpretation. Here, we report the 1.8 A resolution structure of NikA and show that it binds FeEDTA(H2O)- with very high affinity. In addition, we provide crystallographic evidence that a metal-EDTA complex was also bound to the previously reported NikA structure. Our observations strongly suggest that nickel transport in E. coli requires the binding of this metal ion to a metallophore that bears significant resemblance to EDTA. They also provide a basis for the potential use of NikA in the bioremediation of toxic transition metals and the design of artificial metalloenzymes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","doi":"10.1021\/ja0518530","issns":["0002-7863"],"issue":"28","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1128902400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16011372"],"pmid":"16011372","pubdate":"2005-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Crystallographic and spectroscopic evidence for high affinity binding of FeEDTA(H2O)- to the periplasmic nickel transporter NikA.","type":"article","volume":"127","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystallographic-spectroscopic-evidence-high-affinity-binding-feedtah2o-periplasmic-nickel-transport"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":2018633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2724940,"mean":5.2337558323348,"rank":1477900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2724940,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12981,"mean":4.1338382126348,"rank":8153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12981,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12893,"mean":4.0763436239528,"rank":8076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12893,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
