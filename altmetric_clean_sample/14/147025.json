In contrast to this view, we report that ATP hydrolysis triggers rapid dissociation of the 19S regulatory particles from immunopurified 26S complexes in a manner coincident with release of the bulk of proteasome-interacting proteins. Strikingly, this mechanism leads to quantitative disassembly of the 19S into subcomplexes and free Rpn10, the polyubiquitin binding subunit. Biochemical reconstitution with purified Sic1, a prototype substrate of the Cdc34\/SCF ubiquitin ligase, suggests that substrate degradation is essential for triggering the ATP hydrolysis-dependent dissociation and disassembly of the 19S and that this mechanism leads to release of degradation products. This is the first demonstration that a controlled dissociation of the 19S regulatory particles from the 26S proteasome is part of the mechanism of protein degradation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","doi":"10.1016\/j.cell.2005.03.028","issns":["0092-8674"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1406027590,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15907469"],"pmid":"15907469","pubdate":"2005-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cell Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"ATP hydrolysis-dependent disassembly of the 26S proteasome is part of the catalytic cycle.","type":"article","volume":"121","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atp-hydrolysisdependent-disassembly-26s-proteasome-part-catalytic-cycle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4052653,"mean":5.0646928712846,"rank":1714821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2222404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4052653,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3067906,"mean":5.5736699352824,"rank":1311405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1692558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3067906,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091,"mean":11.483475648949,"rank":5445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":2544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6758,"mean":11.885824478319,"rank":4409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6758,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
