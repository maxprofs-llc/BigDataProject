Surprisingly little is known about the underlying molecular machinery. Here, we present a visual screen to search for proteins involved in cargo sorting and vesicle formation. We expressed a GFP-tagged plasma membrane protein in the yeast deletion library and identified mutants with altered marker localization. This screen revealed a requirement of several enzymes regulating the synthesis of sphingolipids and ergosterol in the correct and efficient delivery of the marker protein to the cell surface. Additionally, we identified mutants regulating the actin cytoskeleton (Rvs161p and Vrp1p), known membrane traffic regulators (Kes1p and Chs5p), and several unknown genes. This visual screening method can now be used for different cargo proteins to search in a genome-wide fashion for machinery involved in post-Golgi sorting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2005PNAS..10217981P","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Tomasz J Proszynski","Robin W Klemm","Maike Gravert","Peggy P Hsu","Yvonne Gloor","Jan Wagner","Karol Kozak","Hannes Grabner","Karen Walzer","Michel Bagnat","Kai Simons","Christiane Walch-Solimena","Proszynski TJ","Klemm RW","Gravert M","Hsu PP","Gloor Y","Wagner J","Kozak K","Grabner H","Walzer K","Bagnat M","Simons K","Walch-Solimena C","T.
