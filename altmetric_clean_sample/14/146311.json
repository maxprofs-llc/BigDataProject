In this study we screened a collection of 178 292 ESTs from Arabidopsis thaliana by testing them against previously annotated genes of the Arabidopsis genome. We identified several hundreds of new transcripts that match the Arabidopsis genome at so far unassigned loci. The transcriptional activity of these loci was independently confirmed by comparison with the Salk Whole Genome Array Data. To a large extent, the newly identified transcriptionally active genomic regions do not encode 'classic' proteins, but instead generate non-coding RNAs and\/or small peptide-coding RNAs of presently unknown biological function. More than 560 transcripts identified in this study are not represented by the Affymetrix GeneChip arrays currently widely used for expression profiling in A. thaliana. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that numerous previously unknown genes exist in the Arabidopsis genome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003338","doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-313x.2005.02438.x","issns":["0960-7412"],"issue":"2","journal":"Plant Journal","last_mentioned_on":1121817600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15998307"],"pmid":"15998307","pubdate":"2005-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Orphan transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana: identification of several hundred previously unrecognized genes.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/orphan-transcripts-arabidopsis-thaliana-identification-several-hundred-previously-unrecognized-genes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":2017571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935067,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726464,"mean":5.2297632207031,"rank":1477522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":740590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726464,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1848,"mean":1.9548879263671,"rank":865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1848,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1523,"mean":1.9180157687254,"rank":683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1523,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
