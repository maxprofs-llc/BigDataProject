The benzimidazole 'hit' 1 with a KD approximately 100 microM to a 29-mer RNA model of Domain IIA was identified from a 180000-member library using mass spectrometry-based screening methods. Further MS-assisted SAR (structure-activity relationships) studies afforded benzimidazole derivatives with sub-micromolar binding affinity for the IIA RNA construct. The optimized benzimidazoles demonstrated activity in a cellular replicon assay at concentrations comparable to their KD for the RNA target.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Punit P Seth","Alycia Miyaji","Elizabeth A Jefferson","Kristin A Sannes-Lowery","Stephen A Osgood","Stephanie S Propp","Ray Ranken","Christian Massire","Rangarajan Sampath","David J Ecker","Eric E Swayze","Richard H Griffey"],"doi":"10.1021\/jm050815o","issns":["0022-2623"],"issue":"23","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1246141680,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16279767"],"pmid":"16279767","pubdate":"2005-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"SAR by MS: discovery of a new class of RNA-binding small molecules for the hepatitis C virus: internal ribosome entry site IIA subdomain.","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sar-ms-discovery-new-class-rnabinding-small-molecules-hepatitis-c-virus-internal-ribosome-entry-site"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":624862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4411790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4036499,"mean":6.7302079356887,"rank":565663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3470607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4036499,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3120,"mean":3.8447976915678,"rank":286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3120,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2946,"mean":3.8869365025467,"rank":274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2946,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
