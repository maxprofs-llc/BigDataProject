However, CRT is not always successful, is costly, and is applied without individualization. There is no specific measure of synchrony. The goal of this study was to analyze new quantitative parameters of synchrony and compare them with established measures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da1","doi":"10.1016\/j.nuclcard.2005.05.006","issns":["1071-3581"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Nuclear Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1124928000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16084433"],"pmid":"16084433","pubdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"A unique method by which to quantitate synchrony with equilibrium radionuclide angiography.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unique-method-quantitate-synchrony-equilibrium-radionuclide-angiography"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":2017183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":936254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726668,"mean":5.2271585756559,"rank":1477236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":741499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726668,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":398,"mean":1.0274559193955,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":398,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":1.0124365482234,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
