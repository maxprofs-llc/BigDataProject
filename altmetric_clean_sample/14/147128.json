Here, we report that OmpA from Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpOmpA) activates macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in a TLR2-dependent way. However, TLR2 does not account for binding of KpOmpA to innate immune cells. KpOmpA binds the scavenger receptors (SRs) LOX-1 and SREC-I, but not other members of the same family. LOX-1 colocalizes and cooperates with TLR2 in triggering cellular responses. The TLR2-activated functional program includes production of the long pentraxin PTX3, a soluble pattern recognition receptor involved in resistance against diverse pathogens. PTX3, in turn, binds KpOmpA but does not affect recognition of this microbial moiety by cellular receptors. KpOmpA-elicited in vivo inflammation is abrogated in TLR2(-\/-) mice and significantly reduced in PTX3(-\/-) mice. Thus, SR-mediated KpOmpA recognition and TLR2-dependent cellular activation set in motion a nonredundant PTX3-mediated humoral amplification loop of innate immunity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a95","doi":"10.1016\/j.immuni.2005.03.008","issns":["1074-7613"],"issue":"5","journal":"Immunity","last_mentioned_on":1116979200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15894273"],"pmid":"15894273","pubdate":"2005-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Complexity and complementarity of outer membrane protein A recognition by cellular and humoral innate immunity receptors.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complexity-complementarity-outer-membrane-protein-recognition-cellular-humoral-innate-immunity-recep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2018720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2724822,"mean":5.2343439381914,"rank":1477950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2724822,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1763,"mean":4.3589545970488,"rank":942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1763,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1522,"mean":3.4042024983563,"rank":741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1522,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
