Our method reliably distinguishes between different dynamics in wild-type and mutant strains and under different experimental conditions. Using our methods we established that in budding yeast, unlike in metazoans, chromosomes make dynamic attachments to microtubules in G1. This makes it possible to interpret measurements of centromere tag dynamics as reflecting k-MT dynamics. We have examined the sensitivity of our assay by studying the effect of temperature, exposure to benomyl, and a tubulin mutation on k-MT dynamics. We have found that lowering the temperature and exposing cells to benomyl attenuate k-MT dynamics in a similar manner. We further observe that, in contrast to previous reports, the mutant tub2-150 forms k-MTs that depolymerize faster than wild type. Based on these findings, we propose high-resolution light microscopy of centromere dynamics in G1 yeast cells as a sensitive assay for the regulation of single k-MT dynamics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2005BpJ....89.2835D","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["J F Dorn","K Jaqaman","D R Rines","G S Jelson","P K Sorger","G Danuser"],"doi":"10.1529\/biophysj.104.058461","issns":["0006-3495"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1146787200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16192284","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1529\/biophysj.104.058461"],"pmid":"16192284","pubdate":"2005-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Biophysical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Yeast kinetochore microtubule dynamics analyzed by high-resolution three-dimensional microscopy.","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/yeast-kinetochore-microtubule-dynamics-analyzed-highresolution-threedimensional-microscopy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627218,"mean":4.9497513377373,"rank":2018452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":932068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627218,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2725154,"mean":5.2331734746661,"rank":1477793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":738114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2725154,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1683,"mean":2.6932473246136,"rank":733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1683,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1167,"mean":2.3713653516295,"rank":359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1167,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
