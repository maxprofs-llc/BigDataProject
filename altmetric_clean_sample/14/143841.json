We recently reported that signaling complexes consisting of ORL1 receptors and N-type channels mediate a tonic inhibition of calcium entry. Here we show that prolonged ( approximately 30 min) exposure of ORL1 receptors to their agonist nociceptin triggers an internalization of these signaling complexes into vesicular compartments. This effect is dependent on protein kinase C activation, occurs selectively for N-type channels and cannot be observed with mu-opioid or angiotensin receptors. In expression systems and in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, the nociceptin-mediated internalization of the channels is accompanied by a significant downregulation of calcium entry, which parallels the selective removal of N-type calcium channels from the plasma membrane. This may provide a new means for long-term regulation of calcium entry in the pain pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","authors":["Christophe Altier","Houman Khosravani","Rhian M Evans","Shahid Hameed","Jean B Peloquin","Brian A Vartian","Lina Chen","Aaron M Beedle","Stephen S G Ferguson","Alexandre Mezghrani","Stefan J Dubel","Emmanuel Bourinet","John E McRory","Gerald W Zamponi"],"doi":"10.1038\/nn1605","issns":["1097-6256"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nature Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1139443200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16311589"],"pmid":"16311589","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"ORL1 receptor-mediated internalization of N-type calcium channels.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/orl1-receptormediated-internalization-ntype-calcium-channels"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":2018505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2725043,"mean":5.2330978230819,"rank":1477810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2725043,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2643,"mean":16.933632853899,"rank":1835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2643,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2610,"mean":16.540651590648,"rank":1803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2610,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Ph.
