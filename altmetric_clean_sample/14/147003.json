We designed a protamine-antibody fusion protein to deliver siRNA to HIV-infected or envelope-transfected cells. The fusion protein (F105-P) was designed with the protamine coding sequence linked to the C terminus of the heavy chain Fab fragment of an HIV-1 envelope antibody. siRNAs bound to F105-P induced silencing only in cells expressing HIV-1 envelope. Additionally, siRNAs targeted against the HIV-1 capsid gene gag, inhibited HIV replication in hard-to-transfect, HIV-infected primary T cells. Intratumoral or intravenous injection of F105-P-complexed siRNAs into mice targeted HIV envelope-expressing B16 melanoma cells, but not normal tissue or envelope-negative B16 cells; injection of F105-P with siRNAs targeting c-myc, MDM2 and VEGF inhibited envelope-expressing subcutaneous B16 tumors. Furthermore, an ErbB2 single-chain antibody fused with protamine delivered siRNAs specifically into ErbB2-expressing cancer cells. This study demonstrates the potential for systemic, cell-type specific, antibody-mediated siRNA delivery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003162","doi":"10.1038\/nbt1101","issns":["1087-0156","1546-1696"],"issue":"6","journal":"Nature Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1397138870,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15908939","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nbt\/journal\/v23\/n6\/abs\/nbt1101_ja.html"],"pmid":"15908939","pubdate":"2005-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Antibody mediated in vivo delivery of small interfering RNAs via cell-surface receptors.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibody-mediated-vivo-delivery-small-interfering-rnas-via-cellsurface-receptors-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.976,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.976},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":501310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4527139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4039270,"mean":6.7212187888452,"rank":458307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3580952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4039270,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3252,"mean":19.533414949246,"rank":1116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3252,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3234,"mean":19.585265697495,"rank":1110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3234,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":61,"Student  > Ph.
