We now show that substantially different sets of molecules mediate fast and slow endocytosis in the synaptic terminal of retinal bipolar cells. Capacitance measurements of membrane retrieval were made in terminals in which peptides and protein domains were introduced to disrupt known interactions of clathrin, the AP2 adaptor complex, and amphiphysin. All these manipulations caused a selective inhibition of the slow phase of membrane retrieval (time constant approximately 10 s), leaving the fast phase (approximately 1 s) intact. Slow endocytosis after strong stimulation was therefore dependent on the formation of clathrin-coated membrane. Fast endocytosis occurring after weaker stimuli retrieves vesicle membrane in a clathrin-independent manner. All compensatory endocytosis required GTP hydrolysis, but only a subset of released vesicles were primed for fast, clathrin-independent endocytosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","doi":"10.1016\/j.neuron.2005.05.004","issns":["0896-6273"],"issue":"6","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1121644800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15953416"],"pmid":"15953416","pubdate":"2005-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent retrieval of synaptic vesicles in retinal bipolar cells.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clathrindependent-clathrinindependent-retrieval-synaptic-vesicles-retinal-bipolar-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":2017925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2731429,"mean":5.2114990688043,"rank":1477597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":749110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2731429,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3776,"mean":10.062656953642,"rank":2373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3776,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2912,"mean":8.4933321882515,"rank":1617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2912,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
