The ability to secrete large amounts of proteins and the development of a transformation system have facilitated the use of A. oryzae in modern biotechnology. Although both A. oryzae and Aspergillus flavus belong to the section Flavi of the subgenus Circumdati of Aspergillus, A. oryzae, unlike A. flavus, does not produce aflatoxin, and its long history of use in the food industry has proved its safety. Here we show that the 37-megabase (Mb) genome of A. oryzae contains 12,074 genes and is expanded by 7-9 Mb in comparison with the genomes of Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Comparison of the three aspergilli species revealed the presence of syntenic blocks and A. oryzae-specific blocks (lacking synteny with A. nidulans and A. fumigatus) in a mosaic manner throughout the genome of A. oryzae. The blocks of A. oryzae-specific sequence are enriched for genes involved in metabolism, particularly those for the synthesis of secondary metabolites. Specific expansion of genes for secretory hydrolytic enzymes, amino acid metabolism and amino acid\/sugar uptake transporters supports the idea that A. oryzae is an ideal microorganism for fermentation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2005Natur.438.1157M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Masayuki Machida","Kiyoshi Asai","Motoaki Sano","Toshihiro Tanaka","Toshitaka Kumagai","Goro Terai","Ken-Ichi Kusumoto","Toshihide Arima","Osamu Akita","Yutaka Kashiwagi","Keietsu Abe","Katsuya Gomi","Hiroyuki Horiuchi","Katsuhiko Kitamoto","Tetsuo Kobayashi","Michio Takeuchi","David W Denning","James E Galagan","William C Nierman","Jiujiang Yu","David B Archer","Joan W Bennett","Deepak Bhatnagar","Thomas E Cleveland","Natalie D Fedorova","Osamu Gotoh","Hiroshi Horikawa","Akira Hosoyama","Masayuki Ichinomiya","Rie Igarashi","Kazuhiro Iwashita","Praveen Rao Juvvadi","Masashi Kato","Yumiko Kato","Taishin Kin","Akira Kokubun","Hiroshi Maeda","Noriko Maeyama","Jun-ichi Maruyama","Hideki Nagasaki","Tasuku Nakajima","Ken Oda","Kinya Okada","Ian Paulsen","Kazutoshi Sakamoto","Toshihiko Sawano","Mikio Takahashi","Kumiko Takase","Yasunobu Terabayashi","Jennifer R Wortman","Osamu Yamada","Youhei Yamagata","Hideharu Anazawa","Yoji Hata","Yoshinao Koide","Takashi Komori","Yasuji Koyama","Toshitaka Minetoki","Sivasundaram Suharnan","Akimitsu Tanaka","Katsumi Isono","Satoru Kuhara","Naotake Ogasawara","Hisashi Kikuchi","Machida M","Asai K","Sano M","Tanaka T","Kumagai T","Terai G","Kusumoto K","Arima T","Akita O","Kashiwagi Y","Abe K","Gomi K","Horiuchi H","Kitamoto K","Kobayashi T","Takeuchi M","Denning DW","Galagan JE","Nierman WC","Yu J","Archer DB","Bennett JW","Bhatnagar D","Cleveland TE","Fedorova ND","Gotoh O","Horikawa H","Hosoyama A","Ichinomiya M","Igarashi R","Iwashita K","Juvvadi PR","Kato M","Kato Y","Kin T","Kokubun A","Maeda H","Maeyama N","Maruyama J","Nagasaki H","Nakajima T","Oda K","Okada K","Paulsen I","Sakamoto K","Sawano T","Takahashi M","Takase K","Terabayashi Y","Wortman JR","Yamada O","Yamagata Y","Anazawa H","Hata Y","Koide Y","Komori T","Koyama Y","Minetoki T","Suharnan S","Tanaka A","Isono K","Kuhara S","Ogasawara N","Kikuchi H","David W.
