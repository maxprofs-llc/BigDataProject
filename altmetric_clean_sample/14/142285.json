In addition to repressing translation, miRNAs can down-regulate the concentration of mRNAs that contain elements to which they are imperfectly complementary. Using miR-125b and let-7 as representative miRNAs, we show that in mammalian cells this reduction in message abundance is a consequence of accelerated deadenylation, which leads to rapid mRNA decay. The ability of miRNAs to expedite poly(A) removal does not result from decreased translation; nor does translational repression by miRNAs require a poly(A) tail, a 3' histone stem-loop being an effective substitute. These findings suggest that miRNAs use two distinct posttranscriptional mechanisms to down-regulate gene expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006PNAS..103.4034W","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Ligang Wu","Jihua Fan","Joel G Belasco"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0510928103","issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"11","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1212915998,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16495412","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1449641"],"pmid":"16495412","pubdate":"2006-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"From the Cover: MicroRNAs direct rapid deadenylation of mRNA","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/micrornas-direct-rapid-deadenylation-mrna"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628172,"mean":4.9437236464363,"rank":681358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2923022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628172,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726450,"mean":5.2297380218767,"rank":554396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2150898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726450,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33578,"mean":13.655044107574,"rank":11459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":21387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33578,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26606,"mean":16.453003495584,"rank":11339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":14547,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26606,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":25,"Researcher":117,"Student  > Doctoral Student":23,"Student  > Ph.
