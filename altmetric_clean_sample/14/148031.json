Here we present a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay that directly monitors in real time the early interactions between human GPCRs and their cognate G-protein subunits in living human cells. In addition to detecting basal precoupling of the receptors to Galpha-, Gbeta- and Ggamma-subunits, BRET measured very rapid ligand-induced increases in the interaction between receptor and Galphabetagamma-complexes (t(1\/2) approximately 300 ms) followed by a slower (several minutes) decrease, reflecting receptor desensitization. The agonist-promoted increase in GPCR-Gbetagamma interaction was highly dependent on the identity of the Galpha-subunit present in the complex. Therefore, this G protein-activity biosensor provides a novel tool to directly probe the dynamics and selectivity of receptor-mediated, G-protein activation-deactivation cycles that could be advantageously used to identify ligands for orphan GPCRs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000426c","doi":"10.1038\/nmeth743","issns":["1548-7091"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nature Methods","last_mentioned_on":1196802638,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15782186"],"pmid":"15782186","pubdate":"2005-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Real-time monitoring of receptor and G-protein interactions in living cells.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/realtime-monitoring-receptor-gprotein-interactions-living-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9276880009076,"rank":679536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2914497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2715903,"mean":5.1643043666547,"rank":551615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2143165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2715903,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1858,"mean":13.897709208401,"rank":1016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1858,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1845,"mean":13.950706073753,"rank":1010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1845,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":43,"Student  > Ph.
