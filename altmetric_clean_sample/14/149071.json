Memory encoding is thought to occur by long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus; however, it remains unclear how LTP, which has a time window for induction of approximately 100 ms, could encode the linkage between sequential items that arrive with a temporal separation >100 ms. Here, we argue that LTP can underlie the learning of such memory sequences, provided the input to the hippocampus is from a cortical multi-item working memory buffer in which theta and gamma oscillations have an important role. In such a buffer, memory items that occurred seconds apart are represented with a temporal separation of 20-30 ms, thereby bringing them within the LTP window. The physiological and behavioral evidence for such a buffer will be reviewed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b1","doi":"10.1016\/j.tins.2004.12.001","issns":["0166-2236"],"issue":"2","journal":"Trends in Neurosciences","last_mentioned_on":1485986052,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15667928"],"pmid":"15667928","pubdate":"2005-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Hippocampal sequence-encoding driven by a cortical multi-item working memory buffer.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hippocampal-sequenceencoding-driven-cortical-multiitem-working-memory-buffer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":1771783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6331887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7533913,"mean":7.2166406780374,"rank":1691379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5786275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7533913,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1095,"mean":8.49260511883,"rank":435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1095,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1050,"mean":8.7061258341277,"rank":427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1050,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":7,"Professor > Associate Professor":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":16,"Researcher":122,"Student  > Ph.
