By re-analyzing a published data set with a previously developed method, the haplotype sharing statistic, we confirm localization of PSORS1 to the RH1 region and refine its location to marker M6S168. We replicate this result in an independent patient sample. The target region harbors fragments of a human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) endogenous retrovirus. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms with alleles differing between high- and low-risk haplotypes are located within the HERV-K dUTPase. One of these encodes a predicted non-conserved Glu-Arg exchange. The HERV-K dUTPase is expressed in peripheral blood and in normal as well as lesional psoriatic skin. Our results indicate that an endogenous retroviral dUTPase constitutes a candidate gene for the PSORS1 mutation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e0e","authors":["Foerster J","Nolte I","Junge J","Bruinenberg M","Schweiger S","Spaar K","van der Steege G","Ehlert C","Mulder M","Kalscheuer V","Blumenthal-Barby E","Winter J","Seeman P","St\u00e4nder M","Sterry W","Te Meerman G","John Foerster","Ilja Nolte","Judith Junge","Marcel Bruinenberg","Susann Schweiger","Katja Spaar","Gerrit van der Steege","Claudia Ehlert","Marcel Mulder","Vera Kalscheuer","Elisa Blumenthal-Barby","Jennifer Winter","Petra Seeman","Markward St\u00e4nder","Wolfram Sterry","Gerard te Meerman"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.0022-202x.2004.23504.x","endpage":"102","issns":["0022-202X","1523-1747","0022202X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Investigative Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1107302400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15654959"],"pmid":"15654959","pubdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"99","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Haplotype sharing analysis identifies a retroviral dUTPase as candidate susceptibility gene for psoriasis.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0022202X15321102","volume":"124","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/haplotype-sharing-analysis-identifies-retroviral-dutpase-candidate-susceptibility-gene-psoriasis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":2015931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727520,"mean":5.2199161523752,"rank":1476218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":744720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727520,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2099,"mean":4.1583412774071,"rank":1302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2099,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2098,"mean":4.1612494039103,"rank":1301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2098,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
