Here we have investigated this strain-specific, epistatic loss of tolerance using gene-targeted immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain (V(H)) alleles 3H9 or 56R, which encode DNA-specific heavy chains, expressed on the C57BL\/6 or BALB\/c background. The combination of C57BL\/6 and V(H) 56R (B6.56R) resulted in a loss of tolerance; hybridoma and single-cell analysis indicated an FcgammaRIIB-independent difference in immunoglobulin light-chain usage, consistent with an alteration in receptor editing. FcgammaRIIB deficiency resulted in an increase in immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to DNA in the serum, an increased frequency of anti-DNA-reactive IgG(+) B cells with a plasma cell phenotype and immune complex deposition in the glomeruli and renal disease in B6.56R mice. Thus, FcgammaRIIB provides a distal peripheral checkpoint to limit the accumulation of autoreactive plasma cells, thereby maintaining tolerance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","doi":"10.1038\/ni1151","issns":["1529-2908"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1128470400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15592473"],"pmid":"15592473","pubdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The inhibitory Fcgamma receptor modulates autoimmunity by limiting the accumulation of immunoglobulin G+ anti-DNA plasma cells.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibitory-fcgamma-receptor-modulates-autoimmunity-limiting-accumulation-immunoglobulin-g-antidna-pl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630432,"mean":4.9299514944696,"rank":2015648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630432,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2728030,"mean":5.2170467579381,"rank":1476052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":745937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2728030,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1557,"mean":4.8515424164524,"rank":793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1557,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1553,"mean":4.7268981958763,"rank":789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1553,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
