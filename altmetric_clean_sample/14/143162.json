Seeds are borne on axillary branches, which arise from groups of stem cells in axils of leaves and whose branching patterns dictate most of the variation in plant form. Normal maize (Zea mays) ears are unbranched, and tassels have long branches only at their base. The ramosa2 (ra2) mutant of maize has increased branching with short branches replaced by long, indeterminate ones. ra2 was cloned by chromosome walking and shown to encode a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY domain transcription factor. ra2 is transiently expressed in a group of cells that predicts the position of axillary meristem formation in inflorescences. Expression in different mutant backgrounds places ra2 upstream of other genes that regulate branch formation. The early expression of ra2 suggests that it functions in the patterning of stem cells in axillary meristems. Alignment of ra2-like sequences reveals a grass-specific domain in the C terminus that is not found in Arabidopsis thaliana. The ra2-dm allele suggests this domain is required for transcriptional activation of ra1. The ra2 expression pattern is conserved in rice (Oryza sativa), barley (Hordeum vulgare), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and maize, suggesting that ra2 is critical for shaping the initial steps of grass inflorescence architecture.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003335","authors":["Esteban Bortiri","George Chuck","Erik Vollbrecht","Torbert Rocheford","Rob Martienssen","Sarah Hake"],"doi":"10.1105\/tpc.105.039032","issns":["1040-4651"],"issue":"3","journal":"Plant Cell","last_mentioned_on":1143763200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16399802"],"pmid":"16399802","pubdate":"2006-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"ramosa2 encodes a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY domain protein that determines the fate of stem cells in branch meristems of maize.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ramosa2-encodes-lateral-organ-boundary-domain-protein-determines-fate-stem-cells-branch-meristems-ma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":2015868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727554,"mean":5.2195333854231,"rank":1476176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":744869,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727554,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1915,"mean":2.5733928944619,"rank":902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1915,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1474,"mean":2.099094365241,"rank":536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1474,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":37,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
