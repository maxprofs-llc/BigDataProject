The homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex links these two processes: it is an effector for the vacuolar Rab GTPase Ypt7p and is required for vacuolar SNARE complex assembly. We now report that pure, active HOPS complex binds phosphoinositides and the PX domain of the vacuolar SNARE protein Vam7p. These binding interactions support HOPS complex association with the vacuole and explain its enrichment at the same microdomains on docked vacuoles as phosphoinositides, Ypt7p, Vam7p, and the other SNARE proteins. Concentration of the HOPS complex at these microdomains may be a key factor for coupling Rab GTPase activation to SNARE complex assembly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Christopher Stroupe","Kevin M Collins","Rutilio A Fratti","William Wickner"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.emboj.7601051","issns":["0261-4189"],"issue":"8","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1145404800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16601699"],"pmid":"16601699","pubdate":"2006-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Purification of active HOPS complex reveals its affinities for phosphoinositides and the SNARE Vam7p.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/purification-active-hops-complex-reveals-affinities-phosphoinositides-snare-vam7p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628259,"mean":4.9430875566221,"rank":2017525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628259,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726494,"mean":5.2292984467621,"rank":1477485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":740729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726494,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999,"mean":3.1995792896448,"rank":2507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2668,"mean":2.8050926134233,"rank":1306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2668,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
