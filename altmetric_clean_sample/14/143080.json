Cryopyrin (also called Nalp3), the product of CIAS1, is a member of the NOD-LRR protein family that has been linked to the activation of intracellular host defence signalling pathways. Cryopyrin forms a multi-protein complex termed 'the inflammasome', which contains the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and caspase-1, and promotes caspase-1 activation and processing of pro-interleukin (IL)-1beta (ref. 4). Here we show the effect of cryopyrin deficiency on inflammasome function and immune responses. Cryopyrin and ASC are essential for caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta and IL-18 production in response to bacterial RNA and the imidazoquinoline compounds R837 and R848. In contrast, secretion of tumour-necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6, as well as activation of NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were unaffected by cryopyrin deficiency. Furthermore, we show that Toll-like receptors and cryopyrin control the secretion of IL-1beta and IL-18 through different intracellular pathways. These results reveal a critical role for cryopyrin in host defence through bacterial RNA-mediated activation of caspase-1, and provide insights regarding the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory syndromes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006Natur.440..233K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti","Nesrin Oz\u00f6ren","Mathilde Body-Malapel","Amal Amer","Jong-Hwan Park","Luigi Franchi","Joel Whitfield","Winfried Barchet","Marco Colonna","Peter Vandenabeele","John Bertin","Anthony Coyle","Ethan P Grant","Shizuo Akira","Gabriel N\u00fa\u00f1ez","Kanneganti TD","Oz\u00f6ren N","Body-Malapel M","Amer A","Park JH","Franchi L","Whitfield J","Barchet W","Colonna M","Vandenabeele P","Bertin J","Coyle A","Grant EP","Akira S","N\u00fa\u00f1ez G","Nesrin \u00d6z\u00f6ren","Ethan P.
