CDF of L-type Ca2+ channels (Ca(v)1.2) contributes to the positive force-frequency effect in the heart and is believed to involve the activation of Ca2+\/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). How CaMKII is activated and what its substrates are have not yet been determined. We show that the pore-forming subunit alpha(1C) (Ca(v)alpha1.2) is a CaMKII substrate and that CaMKII interaction with the COOH terminus of alpha1C is essential for CDF of L-type channels. Ca2+ influx triggers distinct features of CaMKII targeting and activity. After Ca2+-induced targeting to alpha1C, CaMKII becomes tightly tethered to the channel, even after calcium returns to normal levels. In contrast, activity of the tethered CaMKII remains fully Ca2+\/CaM dependent, explaining its ability to operate as a calcium spike frequency detector. These findings clarify the molecular basis of CDF and demonstrate a novel enzymatic mechanism by which ion channel gating can be modulated by activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce3","authors":["Andy Hudmon","Howard Schulman","James Kim","Janet M Maltez","Richard W Tsien","Geoffrey S Pitt","Hudmon A","Schulman H","Kim J","Maltez JM","Tsien RW","Pitt GS","Janet M.
