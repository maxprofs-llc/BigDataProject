Various beta-hydroxyenones proved to be very good substrates for antibodies 84G3- and 93F3-catalyzed retro-aldol reactions, allowing the preparation of highly enantiomerically enriched (up to 99% ee) precursors of pyranones. An attractive feature of this methodology is the possibility to convert these acyclic-enantioenriched beta-hydroxyenones into tetrahydropyranones by a conventional Michael-type addition procedure or into the corresponding dihydropyranones using an alternative palladium-catalyzed oxidative ring closure. For the palladium-mediated cyclization, a biphasic system has been implemented that allows the direct preparation of enantiopure dihydropyranones from the corresponding racemic aldol precursors using a sequential antibody-resolution\/palladium-cyclization strategy, without isolation of the intermediate enantioenriched hydroxyenones. This bioorganic route is best applied to the preparation of hetero Diels-Alder adducts otherwise derived from less nucleophilic dienes and unactivated dienophiles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","doi":"10.1021\/ja043925d","issns":["0002-7863"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1108512000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15686381"],"pmid":"15686381","pubdate":"2005-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A catalytic asymmetric bioorganic route to enantioenriched tetrahydro- and dihydropyranones.","type":"article","volume":"127","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/catalytic-asymmetric-bioorganic-route-enantioenriched-tetrahydro-dihydropyranones"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634361,"mean":4.9198212791297,"rank":2015869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634361,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2730485,"mean":5.2098354013463,"rank":1475918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":750214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2730485,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12998,"mean":4.0715523582365,"rank":8130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12998,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12907,"mean":4.0125606694561,"rank":8051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12907,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
