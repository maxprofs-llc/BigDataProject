Experimental observations demonstrate that this biological response can be either blunted (tolerance) or augmented (potentiation) with repeated administration of endotoxin. Both phenomena are of clinical relevance. We show that a four-dimensional differential equation model of this response reproduces many scenarios involving repeated endotoxin administration. In particular, the model can display both tolerance and potentiation from a single parameter set, under different administration scenarios. The key determinants of the outcome of our simulations are the relative time-scales of model components. These findings support the hypothesis that endotoxin tolerance and other related phenomena can be considered as dynamic manifestations of a unified acute inflammatory response, and offer specific predictions related to the dynamics of this response to endotoxin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f77","authors":["Judy Day","Jonathan Rubin","Yoram Vodovotz","Carson C Chow","Angela Reynolds","Gilles Clermont"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jtbi.2006.02.015","issns":["0022-5193"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1262304000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16616206"],"pmid":"16616206","pubdate":"2006-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"A reduced mathematical model of the acute inflammatory response II.
