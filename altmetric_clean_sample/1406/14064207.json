The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence and identify risk factors for AD among Brazilian pregnant women.\nAll women living in the urban area of the city of Pelotas, Southern Brazil, with confirmed pregnancy and estimated delivery date in the year 2015, were invited to take part. Eligible pregnant women were recruited from health services. Symptoms of antenatal depression were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) by face-to-face interviews. A cutoff-point of 13 or more was used to define probable AD.\nEPDS scores were available for 4130 women. The prevalence of AD was 16% (95%CI 14\u00b79-17\u00b71). After adjustment for potential confounders, the factors most strongly associated with higher EPDS scores were a previous history of depression (PR 2\u00b781; 95%CI 2\u00b744-3\u00b725), high parity (PR 1\u00b772; 95%CI 1\u00b738-2\u00b715 - \u22652 children vs. 1 child) and maternal education (PR 5\u00b747; 95%CI 4\u00b722-7\u00b709 - 0-4 vs. \u226512 years of formal education).\nEPDS was administered through face-to-face interviews rather than questionnaires and some women may have felt uncomfortable reporting their symptoms leading to underreporting and consequently underestimation of the prevalence found.\nAD prevalence is substantially higher in Brazil than in high-income countries (HICs) but similar to other LMICs. Our study identified relevant risk factors that may be potential targets to plan interventions, particularly a history of depression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c6c","authors":["Carolina de Vargas Nunes Coll","Mari\u00e2ngela Freitas da Silveira","Diego Garcia Bassani","Elena Netsi","Fernando C\u00e9sar Wehrmeister","Fernando C\u00e9sar Barros","Alan Stein","Coll, Carolina de Vargas Nunes","da Silveira, Mari\u00e2ngela Freitas","Bassani, Diego Garcia","Netsi, Elena","Wehrmeister, Fernando C\u00e9sar","Barros, Fernando C\u00e9sar","Stein, Alan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jad.2016.11.031","endpage":"146","first_seen_on":"2016-11-25T22:40:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-2517","01650327"],"journal":"Journal of Affective Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1488586743,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jad-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS0165-0327%2816%2931648-2%2Ffulltext%3Frss%3Dyes&code=jad-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0165032716316482","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=4&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jad-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS0165-0327%2816%2931648-2%2Ffulltext%3Fsf52539638%3D1&code=jad-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jad-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS0165-0327%2816%2931648-2%2Ffulltext%3Fsf52539638%3D1&rc=0&code=jad-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=1&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jad-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS0165-0327%2816%2931648-2%2Ffulltext%3Fsf52539639%3D1&code=jad-site","http:\/\/www.jad-journal.com\/article\/S0165-0327(16)31648-2\/fulltext?sf52539709=1","http:\/\/www.jad-journal.com\/article\/S0165-0327(16)31648-2\/fulltext?sf52539710=1","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=2&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jad-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS0165-0327%2816%2931648-2%2Ffulltext%3Fsf52539640%3D1&code=jad-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jad-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS0165-0327%2816%2931648-2%2Ffulltext%3Fsf52539641%3D1&rc=0&code=jad-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jad-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS0165-0327%2816%2931648-2%2Ffulltext%3Fsf52539640%3D1&code=jad-site","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27914247"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jad-journal.com\/article\/S0165032716316482\/pdf","pmid":"27914247","pubdate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"140","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Antenatal depressive symptoms among pregnant women: evidence from a Southern Brazilian population-based cohort study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0165032716316482","volume":"209","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antenatal-depressive-symptoms-among-pregnant-women-evidence-southern-brazilian-populationbased-cohor-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":4.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":1766553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6529726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277425,"mean":11.944796802007,"rank":78936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":197944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277425,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4354,"mean":6.1756710314725,"rank":1161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":3183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4354,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237,"mean":7.0335593220339,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
