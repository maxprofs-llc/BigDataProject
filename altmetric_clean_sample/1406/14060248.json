Five patients were treated cases of glioblastoma with suspected recurrence. F-FDG and Ga PSMA-11 brain scans were done for these patients. Five patients were sent for assessing the nature (primary lesion\/metastasis) of space occupying lesion in brain. They underwent whole body F-FDG PET\/CT scan and a primary site elsewhere in the body was ruled out. Subsequently they underwent Ga PSMA-11 brain PET\/CT imaging. Target to background ratios (TBR) for the brain lesions were calculated using contralateral cerebellar uptake as background.\nIn five treated cases of glioblastoma with suspected recurrence the findings of Ga PSMA-11 PET\/CT showed good correlation with that of F-FDG PET\/CT scan. Compared to the F-FDG, Ga PSMA-11 PET\/CT showed better visualization of the recurrent lesion (presence\/absence) owing to its significantly high TBR. Among the five cases evaluated for lesion characterization glioma and atypical meningioma patients showed higher SUVmax in the lesion with Ga PSMA-11 than with F-FDG and converse in cases of lymphoma. TBR was better with Ga PSMA PET\/CT in all cases.\nGa PSMA-11 PET\/CT brain imaging is a potentially useful imaging tool in the evaluation of brain lesions. Absence of physiological uptake of Ga PSMA-11 in the normal brain parenchyma results in high TBR values and consequently better visualization of metabolically active disease in brain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Sasikumar, Arun","Joy, Ajith","Pillai, M R A","Nanabala, Raviteja","Anees K, Muhammed","Jayaprakash, P G","Madhavan, Jayaprakash","Nair, Suresh"],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0000000000001451","first_seen_on":"2016-11-25T18:21:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-0229","0363-9762"],"journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1480097423,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27846000"],"pmid":"27846000","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Diagnostic Value of 68Ga PSMA-11 PET\/CT Imaging of Brain Tumors\u2014Preliminary Analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnostic-value-68ga-psma11-petct-imaging-brain-tumorspreliminary-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7747098,"mean":6.6307251234818,"rank":4022801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2175890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7747098,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249361,"mean":12.192571294514,"rank":136617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249361,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2253,"mean":1.0868809946714,"rank":607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2253,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":12.991428571429,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
