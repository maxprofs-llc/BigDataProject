Interprofessional education (IPE) using simulation technology has gained popularity to address this need because of its inherent ability to impact learners' cognitive frames and promote peer-to-peer dialog. Provider attitudes toward teamwork have been directly linked to the quality of patient care. Investigators implemented a simulation-enhanced IPE intervention to improve staff attitudes toward teamwork and interprofessional communication in the emergency department setting.\nThe 3-hour course consisted of a didactic session highlighting teamwork and communication strategies, 2 simulation scenarios on septic shock and cardiac arrest, and structured debriefing directed at impacting participant attitudes to teamwork and communication. This was a survey-based observational study. We used the TeamSTEPPS Teamwork Attitudes Questionnaire immediately before and after the session as a measurement of attitude change as well as the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture before the session and 1 year after the intervention for program impact at the behavior level.\nSeventy-two emergency department nurses and resident physicians participated in the course from July to September 2012. Of the 5 constructs in TeamSTEPPS Teamwork Attitudes Questionnaire, 4 had a significant improvement in scores-6.4%, 2.8%, 4.0%, and 4.0% for team structure, leadership, situation monitoring, and mutual support, respectively (P < 0.0001, P = 0.029, P = 0.014, and P = 0.003, respectively). For Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture, 3 of 6 composites directly related to teamwork and communication showed a significant improvement-20.6%, 20.5%, and 23.9%, for frequency of event reporting, teamwork within hospital units, and hospital handoffs and transitions, respectively (P = 0.028, P = 0.035, and P = 0.024, respectively).\nA simulation-enhanced IPE curriculum was successful in improving participant attitudes toward teamwork and components of patient safety culture related to teamwork and communication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008937","authors":["Wong, Ambrose Hon-Wai","Gang, Maureen","Szyld, Demian","Mahoney, Heather"],"doi":"10.1097\/sih.0000000000000133","first_seen_on":"2016-04-06T05:57:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-713X","1559-2332"],"issue":"2","journal":"Simulation in Healthcare","last_mentioned_on":1463209338,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/simulationinhealthcare\/Abstract\/2016\/04000\/Making_an__Attitude_Adjustment___Using_a.9.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/simulationinhealthcare\/Pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=04000&article=00009&type=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/simulationinhealthcare\/Fulltext\/2016\/04000\/Making_an__Attitude_Adjustment___Using_a.9.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/simulationinhealthcare\/Fulltext\/2016\/04000\/Making_an__Attitude_Adjustment___Using_a.9.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/simulationinhealthcare\/2016\/04000\/Making_an__Attitude_Adjustment___Using_a.9.pdf","pmid":"27043097","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"117","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Making an \"Attitude Adjustment\": Using a Simulation-Enhanced Interprofessional Education Strategy to Improve Attitudes Toward Teamwork and Communication.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/simulationinhealthcare\/Fulltext\/2016\/04000\/Making_an__Attitude_Adjustment___Using_a.9.aspx","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/making-attitude-adjustment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695064,"mean":6.6060460035168,"rank":887555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6806331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695064,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273203,"mean":11.241008953082,"rank":46420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":226674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273203,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":606,"mean":2.8052066115702,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":606,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":3.2647058823529,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":7,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
