Marrif, Salma I. Al-Sunousi"],"citation":{"abstract":"Type two diabetes (T2D) is a challenging metabolic disorder for which a cure has not yet been found. Its etiology is associated with several phenomena, including significant loss of insulin-producing, beta cell (\u03b2 cell) mass via progressive programmed cell death and disrupted cellular autophagy. In diabetes, the etiology of \u03b2 cell death and the role of mitochondria are complex and involve several layers of mechanisms. Understanding the dynamics of those mechanisms could permit researchers to develop an intervention for the progressive loss of \u03b2 cells. Currently, diabetes research has shifted toward rejuvenation and plasticity technology and away from the simplified approach of hormonal compensation. Diabetes research is currently challenged by questions such as how to enhance cell survival, decrease apoptosis and replenish \u03b2 cell mass in diabetic patients. In this review, we discuss evidence that \u03b2 cell development and mass formation are guided by specific signaling systems, particularly hormones, transcription factors, and growth factors, all of which could be manipulated to enhance mass growth. There is also strong evidence that \u03b2 cells are dynamically active cells, which, under specific conditions such as obesity, can increase in size and subsequently increase insulin secretion. In certain cases of aggressive or advanced forms of T2D, \u03b2 cells become markedly impaired, and the only alternatives for maintaining glucose homeostasis are through partial or complete cell grafting (the Edmonton protocol). In these cases, the harvesting of an enriched population of viable \u03b2 cells is required for transplantation. This task necessitates a deep understanding of the pharmacological agents that affect \u03b2 cell survival, mass, and function. The aim of this review is to initiate discussion about the important signals in pancreatic \u03b2 cell development and mass formation and to highlight the process by which cell death occurs in diabetes. This review also examines the attempts that have been made to recover or increase cell mass in diabetic patients by using various pharmacological agents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc18","authors":["Marrif, Husnia I.","Al-Sunousi, Salma I.","Marrif, Husnia I","Al-Sunousi, Salma I"],"doi":"10.3389\/fphar.2016.00083","first_seen_on":"2016-04-06T07:52:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1663-9812"],"journal":"Frontiers in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1461147906,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2016.00083\/full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27092078?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2016.00083\/pdf","pmid":"27092078","pubdate":"2016-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Pancreatic \u03b2 Cell Mass Death","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pancreatic-%CE%B2-cell-mass-death"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":5735215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1016085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271959,"mean":11.226531214378,"rank":191264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271959,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1624,"mean":3.2370634627234,"rank":781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1624,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":2.933908045977,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
