Amphibians represent the transitional taxon from aquatic to terrestrial life. Exploring the molecular basis of their skin function and adaptation is important to understand the survival and evolutionary mechanisms of vertebrates. However, comprehensive studies on the molecular mechanisms of skin functions in amphibians are scarce. In this study, we sequenced the skin transcriptomes of seven anurans belonging to three families and compared the similarities and differences in expressed genes and proteins. Unigenes and pathways related to basic biological processes and special functions, such as defense, immunity, and respiration, were enriched in functional annotations. A total of 108 antimicrobial peptides were identified. The highly expressed genes were similar in species of the same family but were different among families. Additionally, the positively selected orthologous groups were involved in biosynthesis, metabolism, immunity, and defense processes. This study is the first to generate extensive transcriptome data for the skin of seven anurans and provides unigenes and pathway candidates for further studies on amphibian skin function and adaptation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Huang, Li","Li, Jun","Anboukaria, Housseni","Luo, Zhenhua","Zhao, Mian","Wu, Hua","Li Huang","Jun Li","Housseni Anboukaria","Zhenhua Luo","Mian Zhao","Hua Wu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep24069","first_seen_on":"2016-04-06T02:40:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1496110023,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27040083","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep24069"],"pmid":"27040083","pubdate":"2016-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Molecular ecology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular evolution","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"24069","subjects":["science"],"title":"Comparative transcriptome analyses of seven anurans reveal functions and adaptations of amphibian skin","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-transcriptome-analyses-seven-anurans-reveal-functions-adaptations-amphibian-skin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":5994360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2000260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277178,"mean":11.435750210154,"rank":178388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":82370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277178,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35780,"mean":14.716581234803,"rank":24092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":9873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35780,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2802,"mean":16.692745448054,"rank":1962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2802,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
