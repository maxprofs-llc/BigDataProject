Complete conversion was obtained within 2 h at 25 \u00b0C and, although the rate of reaction increased with increasing temperature up to 100 \u00b0C, the selectivity to chloroaniline remained at 99.0%. Use of Pd\/OMS-2 or Pt\/Al2O3 resulted in significant dechlorination even at 25 \u00b0C and 2 bar hydrogen pressure giving a selectivity to chloroaniline of 34.5% and 77.8%, respectively, at complete conversion. This demonstrates the potential of using platinum group metal free catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of halogenated aromatics. Two pathways were observed for the analogous nitrobenzene hydrogenation depending on the catalyst used. The hydrogenation of nitrobenzene was found to follow a direct pathway to aniline and nitrosobenzene over Pd\/OMS-2 in contrast to the OMS and Pt\/OMS-2 catalysts which resulted in formation of nitrosobenzene, azoxybenzene and azobenzene\/hydrazobenzene intermediates before complete conversion to aniline. These results indicate that for Pt\/OMS-2 the hydrogenation proceeds predominantly over the support with the metal acting to dissociate hydrogen. In the case of Pd\/OMS-2 both the hydrogenation and hydrogen adsorption occur on the metal sites.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007400","authors":["Iain McManus","H Daly","H Manyar","Rebecca Taylor","Jillian M.
