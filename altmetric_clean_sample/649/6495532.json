AR genes are frequently detected on animal farms, but little is known about their origin and distribution patterns. We hypothesized that AR genes can transfer from animal feces to the environment through manure, and to this end, we characterized and compared the resistomes (collections of AR genes) of animal feces, manure, and soil samples collected from five dairy farms using a metagenomics approach. Resistomes constituted only up to 1% of the total gene content, but were variable by sector and also farm. Broadly, the identified AR genes were associated with 18 antibiotic resistances classes across all samples; however, the most abundant genes were classified under multidrug transporters (44.75%), followed by resistance to vancomycin (12.48%), tetracycline (10.52%), bacitracin (10.43%), beta-lactam resistance (7.12%), and MLS efflux pump (6.86%) antimicrobials. The AR gene profiles were variable between farms. Farm 09 was categorized as a high risk farm, as a greater proportion of AR genes were common to at least three sectors, suggesting possible horizontal transfer of AR genes. Taxonomic characterization of AR genes revealed that a majority of AR genes were associated with the phylum Proteobacteria. Nonetheless, there were several members of Bacteroidetes, particularly Bacteroides genus and several lineages from Firmicutes that carried similar AR genes in different sectors, suggesting a strong potential for horizontal transfer of AR genes between unrelated bacterial hosts in different sectors of the farms. Further studies are required to affirm the horizontal gene transfer mechanisms between microbiomes of different sectors in animal agroecosystems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f61000746b","authors":["Pitta, Dipti W","Dou, Zhengxia","Kumar, Sanjay","Indugu, Nagaraju","Toth, John Daniel","Vecchiarelli, Bonnie","Bhukya, Bhima","PittaDipti W.","DouZhengxia","KumarSanjay","InduguNagaraju","TothJohn Daniel","VecchiarelliBonnie","BhukyaBhima"],"doi":"10.1089\/fpd.2015.2092","first_seen_on":"2016-04-06T13:12:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1556-7125","1535-3141"],"journal":"Foodborne Pathogens & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1459939812,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27046731?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27046731?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1089\/fpd.2015.2092"],"pmid":"27046731","pubdate":"2016-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["parasitology","microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Metagenomic Evidence of the Prevalence and Distribution Patterns of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes in Dairy Agroecosystems","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metagenomic-evidence-prevalence-distribution-patterns-antimicrobial-resistance-genes-dairy-agroecosy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8125806,"mean":6.8860372201819,"rank":5886866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1950694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8125806,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275878,"mean":11.400571943293,"rank":177522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":82052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275878,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":479,"mean":2.7881046025105,"rank":250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":479,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.76470588235294,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
