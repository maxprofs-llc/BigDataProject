Although disturbed lipid metabolism is a hallmark of T2D, the potential of plasma lipidomics as a biomarker of future T2D is unknown. Our objective was to develop and validate a plasma lipidomic risk score (LRS) as a biomarker of future type 2 diabetes and to evaluate its cost-effectiveness for T2D screening.\nPlasma LRS, based on significantly associated lipid species from an array of 319 lipid species, was developed in a cohort of initially T2D-free individuals from the San Antonio Family Heart Study (SAFHS). The LRS derived from SAFHS as well as its recalibrated version were validated in an independent cohort from Australia - the AusDiab cohort. The participants were T2D-free at baseline and followed for 9197 person-years in the SAFHS cohort (n\u2009=\u2009771) and 5930 person-years in the AusDiab cohort (n\u2009=\u2009644). Statistically and clinically improved T2D prediction was evaluated with established statistical parameters in both cohorts. Modeling studies were conducted to determine whether the use of LRS would be cost-effective for T2D screening. The main outcome measures included accuracy and incremental value of the LRS over routinely used clinical predictors of T2D risk; validation of these results in an independent cohort and cost-effectiveness of including LRS in screening\/intervention programs for T2D.\nThe LRS was based on plasma concentration of dihydroceramide 18:0, lysoalkylphosphatidylcholine 22:1 and triacyglycerol 16:0\/18:0\/18:1. The score predicted future T2D independently of prediabetes with an accuracy of 76\u00a0%. Even in the subset of initially euglycemic individuals, the LRS improved T2D prediction. In the AusDiab cohort, the LRS continued to predict T2D significantly and independently. When combined with risk-stratification methods currently used in clinical practice, the LRS significantly improved the model fit (p\u2009<\u20090.001), information content (p\u2009<\u20090.001), discrimination (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and reclassification (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in both cohorts. Modeling studies demonstrated that LRS-based risk-stratification combined with metformin supplementation for high-risk individuals was the most cost-effective strategy for T2D prevention.\nConsidering the novelty, incremental value and cost-effectiveness of LRS it should be used for risk-stratification of future T2D.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086a","authors":["Mamtani, Manju","Kulkarni, Hemant","Wong, Gerard","Weir, Jacquelyn M","Barlow, Christopher K","Dyer, Thomas D","Almasy, Laura","Mahaney, Michael C","Comuzzie, Anthony G","Glahn, David C","Magliano, Dianna J","Zimmet, Paul","Shaw, Jonathan","Williams-Blangero, Sarah","Duggirala, Ravindranath","Blangero, John","Meikle, Peter J","Curran, Joanne E","Manju Mamtani","Hemant Kulkarni","Gerard Wong","Jacquelyn M.
