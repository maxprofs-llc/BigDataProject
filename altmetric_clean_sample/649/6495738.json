These compounds are liriodenine, (-)-N-acetylanonaine, pressalanine A, p-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, (-)-bornesitol and \u03b2-sitostenone. These compounds were screened for anti-proliferation and anti-tyrosinase activities in B16F10 cells. Liriodenine, pressalanine A, (-)-bornesitol and \u03b2-sitostenone displayed cytotoxicity at high concentration (100 \u03bcM), but liriodenine (5 \u03bcM), (-)-N-acetylanonaine (10 \u03bcM), and \u03b2-sitostenone (5 \u03bcM) inhibit tyrosinase activity and reduce the melanin content in B16F10 cells without cytotoxicity, suggesting that liriodenine and \u03b2-sitostenone could be safe and potentially used in cosmetic skin whitening.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Chu, Chia-Wei","Liu, Chi-Ming","Chung, Mei-Ing","Chen, Chung-Yi"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules200712166","endpage":"12174","first_seen_on":"2016-04-06T13:24:17+00:00","issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"7","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1459937975,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26151114?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26151114","pubdate":"2015-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"12166","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Biofunctional Constituents from Michelia compressa var. lanyuensis with Anti-Melanogenic Properties","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biofunctional-constituents-michelia-compressa-var-lanyuensis-antimelanogenic-properties"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7506617,"mean":6.4985319251666,"rank":6502237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7506617,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271021,"mean":11.223963891963,"rank":229044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271021,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3310,"mean":2.1345228165609,"rank":2148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3310,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262,"mean":1.8824904214559,"rank":214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
