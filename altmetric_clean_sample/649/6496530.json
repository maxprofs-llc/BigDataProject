We present here the synthesis of a new quinonoid ligand platform containing an [O,O,O,N] donor set. The ligand is derived from a chloranilic acid core by using the [NR] (nitrogen atom with a substituent R) for [O] isoelectronic substitution. Mononuclear Fe(II) and Co(II) complexes have been synthesized with this new ligand. Results obtained from single crystal X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, (spectro)electrochemistry, SQUID magnetometry, multi-frequency EPR spectroscopy and FIR spectroscopy are used to elucidate the electronic and geometric structures of the complexes. Furthermore, we show here that the spin state of the Fe(II) complex can be influenced by temperature, pressure and light and the Co(II) complex displays redox-induced spin-state switching. Bistability is observed in the solid-state as well as in solution for the Fe(II) complex. The new ligand presented here, owing to the [NR] group present in it, will likely have more adaptability while investigating switching phenomena compared to its [O,O,O,O] analogues. Thus, such classes of ligands as well as the results obtained on the reversible changes in physical properties of the metal complexes are likely to contribute to the generation of multifunctional molecular materials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Biprajit Sarkar","Margarethe van der Meer","Yvonne Rechkemmer","Frauke Breitgoff","Sebastian Dechert","Raphael Marx","Mar\u00eda D\u00f6rfel","Petr Neugebauer","Joris van Slageren","van der Meer, Margarethe","Rechkemmer, Yvonne","Breitgoff, Frauke D","Dechert, Sebastian","Marx, Raphael","D\u00f6rfel, Mar\u00eda","Neugebauer, Petr","van Slageren, Joris","Sarkar, Biprajit","Frauke D.
