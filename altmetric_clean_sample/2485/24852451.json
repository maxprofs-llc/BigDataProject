Different \u03a8 modifications correlate with stress responses and are postulated to coordinate the distinct biological responses to a diverse panel of cellular stresses. With the help of different guide RNAs, the dyskerin complex pseudouridylates ribosomal RNA, small nuclear RNA and selective messenger RNAs. To monitor \u03a8 levels quantitatively, a previously reported high performance liquid chromatography method coupled with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) was modified to determine total \u03a8 levels in different cellular RNA fractions. Our method was validated to be accurate and precise within the linear range of 0.06-15.36 pmol\/\u03bcL and to have absolute \u03a8 quantification levels as low as 3.07 pmol. Using our optimized HPLC assay, we found that 1.20% and 1.94% of all ribonucleosides in nuclear-enriched RNA and small non-coding RNA pools from the HEK293 cell line, and 1.77% and 0.98% of ribonucleosides in 18S and 28S rRNA isolated from the HeLa cell line, were pseudouridylated. Upon knockdown of dyskerin expression, a consistent and significant reduction in total \u03a8 levels in nuclear-enriched RNA pools was observed. Our assay provides a fast and accurate quantification method to measure changes in \u03a8 levels of different RNA pools without sample derivatization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90f3cf058f61000cc1b","authors":["Xu, Jialin","Gu, Alice Y","Thumati, Naresh R","Wong, Judy M Y","Jialin Xu","Alice Gu","Naresh Thumati","Judy Wong"],"doi":"10.3390\/genes8090219","first_seen_on":"2017-09-06T10:06:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2073-4425"],"issue":"9","journal":"Genes","last_mentioned_on":1506984259,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28872587?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/9\/219","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/genes8090219"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/9\/219\/pdf","pmid":"28872587","pubdate":"2017-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"MDPI AG","title":"Quantification of Pseudouridine Levels in Cellular RNA Pools with a Modified HPLC-UV Assay","type":"article","volume":"8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":3.6,"6m":3.6,"3m":3.6,"1m":2.6,"1w":1.35,"6d":1.35,"5d":1.35,"4d":1.35,"3d":0.85,"2d":0.85,"1d":0.85,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461420,"mean":7.1086615788596,"rank":1997403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6450308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461420,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166333,"mean":12.210837096891,"rank":47820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":117999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166333,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":516,"mean":2.8953087378641,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":516,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":2.1068888888889,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1,"CH":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"peer_reviews":[{"title":"Quantification of pseudouridine levels in cellular RNA pools with a modified HPLC-UV assay","url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/publon\/review\/OmFpeFuB\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[24852451],"posted_on":"2017-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Georgeta Basturea","url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/author\/1282512\/","id_on_source":1282512},"pr_id":"publons","publons_quality_score":null,"publons_significance_score":null,"publons_review_type":null,"publons_weighted_average":null,"publons_article_url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/publon\/1115733\/","pubpeer_publication_url":null}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cdbox_hacabox\/statuses\/905371640405491712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24852451],"posted_on":"2017-09-06T10:06:34+00:00","author":{"name":"C\/D Box | H\/ACA Box","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"cdbox_hacabox","tweeter_id":"888117607945064451","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":0},"tweet_id":"905371640405491712"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LC_Analysis\/statuses\/905740089346621440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24852451],"posted_on":"2017-09-07T10:30:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Your HPLC DataBase","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/757677916742356993\/glBB3JND_normal.jpg","description":"Get interesting information about Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry\n- For free!
