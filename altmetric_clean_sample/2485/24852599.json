However, not all TJA patients are healthy enough to safely undergo these procedures in an ambulatory setting. We examined the percentage of arthroplasty patients who would be eligible to have the procedure performed in a free-standing ASC and the distribution of comorbidities making patients ASC-ineligible.\nWe reviewed the charts of 3444 patients undergoing TJA and assigned ASC eligibility based on American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status, a set of exclusion criteria, and any existing comorbidities.\nOverall, 70.03% of all patients undergoing TJA were eligible for ASC. Of the ASA class 3 patients who did not meet any exclusion criteria but had systemic disease (51.11% of all ASA class 3 patients), 53.69% were deemed ASC-eligible because of sufficiently low severity of comorbidities. The most frequent reasons for ineligibility were body mass index >40 kg\/m(2) (32.66% of ineligible patients), severity of comorbidities (28.00%), and untreated obstructive sleep apnea (25.19%).\nA large proportion of TJA patients were found to be eligible for surgery in an ASC, including over one-third of ASA class 3 patients. ASC performed TJA provides an opportunity for increased patient satisfaction and decreased costs, selecting the right candidates for the ambulatory setting is critical to maintain patient safety and avoid postoperative complications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Matthew T.
