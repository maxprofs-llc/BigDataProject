Here, we report that Ca(2+)\/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) was reversibly inactivated by RSS via polysulfidation of the active site Cys residue. CaMKIV is phosphorylated at Thr(196) by its upstream CaMK kinase (CaMKK), resulting in the induction of its full activity. In vitro incubation of CaMKIV with the exogenous RSS donors Na2Sn ( n = 2-4) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of the CaMKK-induced phospho-Thr(196) and consequent inactivation of the enzyme activity. Conversely, mutated CaMKIV (C198V) was refractory to the Na2Sn-induced enzyme inhibition. A biotin-polyethylene glycol-conjugated maleimide (biotin-PEG-MAL) capture assay revealed that Cys(198) in CaMKIV represents a target for S -polysulfidation. Furthermore, phosho-Thr(196) and CaMKIV activity were inhibited by incubation with cysteine hydropersulfide, a newly identified reactive sulfur species that is generated from cystine by cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase. In transfected cells expressing CaMKIV, ionomycin-induced CaMKIV phosphorylation at Thr(196) was decreased upon treatment with either Na2S4 or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducer, thapsigargin whereas cells expressing mutant CaMKIV (C198V) were resistant to this treatment. In addition, the ionomycin-induced phospho-Thr(196) of endogenous CaMKIV was also inhibited by treatment either with Na2S4 or thapsigargin in Jurkat T lymphocytes. Together, these data define a novel signaling function for intracellular RSS in inhibiting CaMKIV activity via S- polysulfidation of its Cys(198) during the response to ER stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["Tsuyoshi Takata","Hideshi Ihara","Naoya Hatano","Yukihiro Tsuchiya","Takaaki Akaike","Yasuo Watanabe"],"doi":"10.1042\/bcj20170092","first_seen_on":"2017-07-18T08:32:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0264-6021","1470-8728"],"journal":"Biochemical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1501692249,"links":["http:\/\/www.biochemj.org\/content\/474\/15\/2547?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1042\/BCJ20170092","http:\/\/www.biochemj.org\/content\/early\/2017\/06\/21\/BCJ20170092"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biochemj.org\/content\/ppbiochemj\/474\/15\/2547.full.pdf","pmid":"28637792","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Portland Press Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"\n            \n              Reactive sulfur species inactivate Ca\n              2+\n              \/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV via\n              S\n              -polysulfidation of its active-site cysteine residue\n            \n          ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reactive-sulfur-species-inactivate-ca-sup2sup-calmodulindependent-protein-kinase-iv-via-spolysulfida"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":2.6,"3m":2.6,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":3361868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4926519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201211,"mean":12.07375330252,"rank":70654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":129348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201211,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4992,"mean":2.8432258064516,"rank":3126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4992,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":2.3597407407407,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HeyDrWilson\/statuses\/887228144436097024","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22081904],"posted_on":"2017-07-18T08:30:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Caleph B.
