The study population consisted of 21,977 individuals aged 20 and older, from Canada's ten provinces. Odds ratios were computed using multinomial logistic regression to calculate estimates of the association between MCS and mental illness. All analyses were weighted to take into account the complex survey design.\nIndividuals with MCS had 2.37 (1.55, 3.64) times greater odds of MDD, 3.09 (1.80, 5.30) times greater odds of MDD+GAD, and 2.60 (1.67, 4.07) times greater odds of severe distress. No association between MCS and GAD was observed. A sex difference was observed with males with MCS having lower odds of positive mental wellbeing, whereas no association was observed in females.\nThe present study findings supported an association between MCS and mental illness. The causal mechanism supporting this association remains unclear.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002eec","authors":["Dylan Johnson","Ian Colman"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpsychores.2017.06.002","first_seen_on":"2017-07-18T09:14:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00223999","1879-1360"],"journal":"Journal of Psychosomatic Research","last_mentioned_on":1504062070,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?Db=pubmed&term=mcs+multiple+chemical+sensitivity","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28712429?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews","http:\/\/www.jpsychores.com\/article\/S0022-3999(17)30177-0\/fulltext?rss=yes","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28712429","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jpsychores.2017.06.002"],"pmid":"28712429","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"The association between multiple chemical sensitivity and mental illness: Evidence from a nationally representative sample of Canadians","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-multiple-chemical-sensitivity-mental-illness-evidence-nationally-representative"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.33,"score_history":{"1y":9.33,"6m":9.33,"3m":9.33,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":955220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7495242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227974,"mean":12.987116851557,"rank":39341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":188582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227974,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1415,"mean":6.2773536067892,"rank":189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1415,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":5.4792307692308,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"mcs multiple chemical sensitivity -
