Although a rare disease, with just over 100 cases reported, it may be under-recognised. Its presentation can be protean with prominent neuropsychiatric features, stroke-like episodes, seizures and myoclonic jerks. Prompt corticosteroid treatment usually leads to rapid recovery. Here we report a patient with HE, initially presenting with florid neuropsychiatric symptoms. Recent developments in the understanding of this condition are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bec","authors":["Wilcox RA","To T","Koukourou A","Frasca J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jocn.2006.10.019","endpage":"1304","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T16:37:25+00:00","issns":["0967-5868","09675868"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Clinical Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1230777579,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0967-5868(07)00043-4","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jocn.2006.10.019","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18313925","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18313925"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jocn-journal.com\/article\/S0967586807000434\/pdf","pmid":"18313925","pubdate":"2008-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1301","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Hashimoto's encephalopathy masquerading as acute psychosis.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hashimotos-encephalopathy-masquerading-acute-psychosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6420515,"mean":5.8843321179586,"rank":1452017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4337970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6420515,"percentile":67},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196420,"mean":8.6045820618169,"rank":58162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":135362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196420,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":672,"mean":2.4850163934426,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":672,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.2847826086957,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
