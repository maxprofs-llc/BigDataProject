However, with the use of data from a 35-year field study of chimpanzees, high-ranking females were shown to have significantly higher infant survival, faster maturing daughters, and more rapid production of young. Given the foraging behavior of chimpanzees, high rank probably influences reproductive success by helping females establish and maintain access to good foraging areas rather than by sparing them stress from aggression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Anne Pusey","Jennifer Williams","Jane Goodall","A.
