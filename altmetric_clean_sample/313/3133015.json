Basic research mainly focuses on bone marrow and embryonic stem cells. Clinical applications of stem cells in the treatment of acute heart failure, acute liver failure and lower limb ischaemia have been reported by many hospitals. China enacted its 'Ethical Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research' in 2003. At present, China has the most liberal and favourable environments for human embryonic stem cell research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032f2","authors":["Lianming Liao","Lingsong Li","Robert Chunhua Zhao"],"doi":"10.1098\/rstb.2007.2037","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T16:39:40+00:00","issns":["1471-2970"],"journal":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1228062198,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1098\/rstb.2007.2037","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17341453","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2435574"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/royptb\/362\/1482\/1107.full.pdf","pmid":"17341453","publisher":"The Royal Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Stem cell research in China","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stem-cell-research-china-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3927667,"mean":5.0174984198237,"rank":898981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2491293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3927667,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120934,"mean":8.9094498875366,"rank":35857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":83475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120934,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1955,"mean":7.3001577060932,"rank":845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1955,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":15.538857142857,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Tong Dizhou","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=255011356#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3133015],"posted_on":"2008-11-30T16:23:18+00:00","summary":"Tong Dizhou (\u7ae5\u7b2c\u5468) (May 28, 1902 \uff0d March 30, 1979) was a Chinese embryologist remembered for his contributions to the field of cloning.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=973296","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"TimVickers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:TimVickers"}}]}}
