The data from multi-electrode studies present important analysis challenges that must be resolved for optimal use of these neurophysiological measurements to answer questions about how the brain works. Here we review statistical methods for the analysis of multiple neural spike-train data and discuss future challenges for methodology research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","authors":["Emery N Brown","Robert E Kass","Partha P Mitra","Brown, Emery N","Kass, Robert E","Mitra, Partha P"],"doi":"10.1038\/nn1228","endpage":"461","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T16:20:12+00:00","issns":["1097-6256","1546-1726"],"issue":"5","journal":"Nature Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1501615183,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nn1228","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15114358","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/v7\/n5\/abs\/nn1228.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/v7\/n5\/full\/nn1228.html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15114358"],"pmid":"15114358","pubdate":"2004-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"456","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Multiple neural spike train data analysis: state-of-the-art and future challenges","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-neural-spike-train-data-analysis-stateoftheart-future-challenges-27"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307946,"mean":7.0029014072595,"rank":1971104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6299279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307946,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243439,"mean":8.2007959891225,"rank":63995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":178287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243439,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3438,"mean":31.721660168752,"rank":2170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3438,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":61.006373333333,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":41,"Researcher":147,"Student  > Doctoral Student":37,"Student  > Ph.
