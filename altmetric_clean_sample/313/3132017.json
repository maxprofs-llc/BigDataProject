This interaction-arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis-is the evolutionary precursor of most other mutualistic root-microbe associations. The molecular analysis of this interaction can elucidate basic principles regarding such associations. This review summarizes our present knowledge about cellular and molecular aspects of AM. Emphasis is placed on morphological changes in colonized cells, transfer of nutrients between both interacting partners, and plant defence responses. Similarities to and differences from other associations of plant and microorganisms are highlighted regarding defence reactions and signal perception.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100066f4","authors":["Bettina Hause","Thomas Fester"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00425-004-1436-x","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T16:27:00+00:00","issns":["1432-2048"],"journal":"Planta","last_mentioned_on":1179245892,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00425-004-1436-x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15871030"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00425-004-1436-x.pdf","pmid":"15871030","pubdate":"2004-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"LifeSciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Molecular and cell biology of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-cell-biology-arbuscular-mycorrhizal-symbiosis-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4697597,"mean":5.4371715448403,"rank":1093598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":3026209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4697597,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159127,"mean":8.6498467252367,"rank":45909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":111170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159127,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":563,"mean":1.8236263345196,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":563,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.0064516129032,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":14,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Ph.
