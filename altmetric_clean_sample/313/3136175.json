One is the ability of hybridizing to the complementary DNA as natural D-DNA. Another property is that the L-DNA could be recognized much more weakly by enzymes than D-DNA. We have focused our attention on these properties and applied L-DNA as a molecular tag. Here, we report that L-D chimera DNA is useful for PCR primers and subsequent separation and hybridization. Precise investigation revealed that in the process of PCR, L-DNA region could not be the PCR template and the polymerase extension reaction stopped at the boundary between L- and D-DNA region. As a result, L-DNA region formed like a \"sticky end\" and played a role of molecular tag. According to the L-DNA tag sequence, the produced L-DNA-tagged PCR products were easily separated or hybridized on the solid surface where the complementary L-DNA was pre-immobilized.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008330","authors":["Hayashi G","Hagihara M","Nakatani K"],"doi":"10.1093\/nass\/49.1.261","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T17:19:02+00:00","issns":["1746-8272"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Symposium Series","last_mentioned_on":1224126371,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17150733","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/nass\/49.1.261"],"pmid":"17150733","pubdate":"2004-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Application of L-DNA as a molecular tag","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-ldna-molecular-tag"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4323244,"mean":4.9563124503167,"rank":988073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2767276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4323244,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141573,"mean":8.0833435707628,"rank":40705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":99038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141573,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.362,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
