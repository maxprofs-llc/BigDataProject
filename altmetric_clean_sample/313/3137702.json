Each enzyme complex is composed of four distinct subunits. The recent solution of the X-ray structure of QFR has provided new insights into the function of these enzymes. Both enzyme complexes contain a catalytic domain composed of a subunit with a covalently bound flavin cofactor, the dicarboxylate binding site, and an iron-sulfur subunit which contains three distinct iron-sulfur clusters. The catalytic domain is bound to the cytoplasmic membrane by two hydrophobic membrane anchor subunits that also form the site(s) for interaction with quinones. The membrane domain of E. coli SQR is also the site where the heme b556 is located. The structure and function of SQR and QFR are briefly summarized in this communication and the similarities and differences in the membrane domain of the two enzymes are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Gary Cecchini","Imke Schr\u00f6der","Robert P Gunsalus","Elena Maklashina"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T17:35:52+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1358045972,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11803023"],"pmid":"11803023","pubdate":"2002-01-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase from Escherichia coli.","type":"article","volume":"1553","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/succinate-dehydrogenase-fumarate-reductase-escherichia-coli-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4475808,"mean":4.7807918521955,"rank":983878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2919500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4475808,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148704,"mean":7.4099896034378,"rank":39023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":107852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148704,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4605,"mean":2.321696785404,"rank":337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":2059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4605,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":1.6157055214724,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
