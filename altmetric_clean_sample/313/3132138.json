Amoebiasis, ascariasis, hookworm infection and trichuriasis are among the ten most common infections in the world. Other parasitic infections such as abdominal angiostrongyliasis, intestinal capillariasis, and strongyloidiasis are of local or regional public health concern. The prevention and control of these infections are now more feasible than ever before owing to the discovery of safe and efficacious drugs, the improvement and simplification of some diagnostic procedures, and advances in parasite population biology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56a768dd2a83eeb12a8b4624","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T16:28:23+00:00","issns":["0042-9686"],"issue":"5","journal":"Bulletin of the World Health Organization","last_mentioned_on":1262663151,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3501340","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2491073"],"pmcid":"PMC2491073","pmid":"3501340","pubdate":"1987-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Public health significance of intestinal parasitic infections","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/public-health-significance-intestinal-parasitic-infections-expert-committee"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4655094,"mean":5.6505438971925,"rank":1120616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2946847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4655094,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161606,"mean":8.6814481482629,"rank":47106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":112347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161606,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266,"mean":5.7359773584906,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":3.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Flatworm","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=335937527#altmetric_citation_17","license":"public","citation_ids":[3132138],"posted_on":"2010-01-05T03:45:51+00:00","summary":"The flatworms, or Platyhelminthes, Plathelminthes, or platyhelminths (from the Greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd, platy, meaning &quot;flat&quot; and \u1f15\u03bb\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03c2 (root: \u1f11\u03bb\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8-), helminth-, meaning worm) are a phylum of relatively simple bilaterian, unsegmented, soft-bodied inverteb","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=24151","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Citation bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Citation bot"}}]}}
