Introducing a sequence containing only glycine and alanine residues (GAr) into substrates can impair their digestion. We previously proposed that a GAr interferes with the unfolding capacity of the proteasome, leading to partial degradation of products. Here we tested that idea in several ways. Stabilizing or destabilizing a folded domain within substrate proteins changed GAr-mediated intermediate production in the way predicted by the model. A downstream folded domain determined the sites of terminal proteolysis. The spacing between a GAr and a folded domain was critical for intermediate production. Intermediates containing a GAr did not remain associated with proteasomes, excluding models whereby retained GAr-containing proteins halt further processing. The following model is supported: a GAr positioned within the ATPase ring reduces the efficiency of coupling between nucleotide hydrolysis and work performed on the substrate. If this impairment takes place when unfolding must be initiated, insertion pauses and proteolysis is limited to the portion of the substrate that has already entered the catalytic chamber of the proteasome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Martin A Hoyt","Judith Zich","Junko Takeuchi","Mingsheng Zhang","Cedric Govaerts","Philip Coffino","Hoyt MA","Zich J","Takeuchi J","Zhang M","Govaerts C","Coffino P"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.emboj.7601058","endpage":"1729","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T16:38:42+00:00","issns":["1460-2075","0261-4189"],"issue":"8","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1260828678,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.emboj.7601058","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16601692","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1440830"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/content\/embojnl\/25\/8\/1720.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1440830","pmid":"16601692","pubdate":"2006-04-18T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"EMBO Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1720","subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Glycine\u2013alanine repeats impair proper substrate unfolding by the proteasome","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1038\/sj.emboj.7601058","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glycinealanine-repeats-impair-proper-substrate-unfolding-proteasome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4143352,"mean":5.1107237333896,"rank":965326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2615284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4143352,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131582,"mean":8.8747873781171,"rank":39891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":89837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131582,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4185,"mean":3.3082490439771,"rank":693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4185,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":18.023,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
