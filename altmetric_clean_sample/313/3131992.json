Two quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) regression equations were developed which showed that separate mechanisms of phenolic cytotoxicity are important - nonspecific toxicity due to hydrophobicity and formation of phenoxyl radicals. The equations most predictive of phenol toxicity are denoted as log1\/C=-0. 98sigma(+)+0.77logP+0.23 or log1\/C=-0.11BDE+0.76logP+0.21, respectively, where C is the minimum concentration of substituted-phenol required for a toxic response. P is the octanol-water partition coefficient, sigma(+) is the electronic Hammett parameter and BDE is the OH homolytic bond dissociation energy. In the literature, phenol toxicity correlated to sigma(+) is rare, but there is strong evidence that phenols possessing electron-releasing groups may be converted to toxic phenoxyl radicals. A common feature in a variety of cells is generation of elevated amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with a rapid growth rate. The slightly elevated cancer risk associated with the use of Premarin may be due to phenoxyl-type radicals derived from one or more of its components.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ef","authors":["C Hansch","S C McKarns","C J Smith","D J Doolittle"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T16:26:39+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0009-2797"],"issue":"1","journal":"Chemico-Biological Interactions","last_mentioned_on":1255931171,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10903419"],"pmid":"10903419","pubdate":"2000-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Comparative QSAR evidence for a free-radical mechanism of phenol-induced toxicity.","type":"article","volume":"127","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-qsar-evidence-freeradical-mechanism-phenolinduced-toxicity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":817238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94669,"mean":8.0592963831497,"rank":24626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94669,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":1.8853290322581,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.83333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
