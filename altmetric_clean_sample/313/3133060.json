In two well-described cases, structurally distinct polyubiquitin chains represent functionally distinct intracellular signals. Recently, additional polymeric structures have been detected in vivo and in vitro, and several large families of proteins with polyubiquitin chain-binding activity have been discovered. Although the molecular mechanisms governing specificity in chain synthesis and recognition are still incompletely understood, the scope of signaling by polyubiquitin chains is likely to be broader than originally envisioned.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a1","authors":["Pickart CM","Fushman D"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbpa.2004.09.009","endpage":"616","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T16:40:04+00:00","issns":["13675931"],"issue":"6","journal":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1469304066,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cbpa.2004.09.009","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15556404"],"pmid":"15556404","pubdate":"2004-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"610","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Polyubiquitin chains: polymeric protein signals.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polyubiquitin-chains-polymeric-protein-signals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093786,"mean":6.8854606510969,"rank":2039562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4947674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093786,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241373,"mean":8.1621293770612,"rank":68631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":167080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241373,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":743,"mean":2.9507843665768,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":743,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.464,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":54,"Student  > Doctoral Student":24,"Student  > Ph.
