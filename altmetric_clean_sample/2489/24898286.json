It is known that Express Sequence Tags (EST) are a short sub-sequence of cDNA sequence, which contain information of condition or tissue specific transcripts (coding and non-coding) of an organism. In the present study, we have applied the bioinformatics tools to identify miRNA from breast cancer using EST resource. Through bioinformatics approach, the presence of an EST encoding hsa-miR-17- 3p of breast cancer was identified. Further studies reveal that hsa-miR-17 is confirmed in the breast cancer specific EST sequence among the predicted miRNAs secondary structure. Moreover, miR-17-3p could be responsible for a tumor suppression, which plays a major role in human breast cancer. Further studies are required to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind miR-17-3p involves in the suppression of breast cancer cells.","authors":["Shincy, J S","Pankal, Mani","Jereena, Jinu","Vengatagiri, Giri Yogesh","Vittalrao, Kshirsagar Rahul","Sivakumar, Pethanen","Gopinath, Vincent","Sekar, Durairaj"],"doi":"10.2174\/2211536606666170830120427","first_seen_on":"2017-09-07T10:34:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2211-5374"],"journal":"MicroRNA (Shariqah, United Arab Emirates)","last_mentioned_on":1504799935,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28875846?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28875846?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28875846","pubdate":"2017-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Computational Identification of microRNA-17-3p in Breast Cancer Cells.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sRNAPapers\/statuses\/905736431108104192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24898286],"posted_on":"2017-09-07T10:16:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Small RNA papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"sRNAPapers","tweeter_id":"3003428519","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":123},"tweet_id":"905736431108104192"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/905795937255153664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24898286],"posted_on":"2017-09-07T14:12:34+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
