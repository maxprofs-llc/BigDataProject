We reviewed the current guidelines and high-quality articles to confirm the LBP guidelines for the Korean Society of Spine Surgery. We searched available databases for high-quality articles in English on LBP published from 2000 to the present year. Literature searches using these guidelines included studies from MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase. We analyzed a total of 132 randomized clinical trials, 116 systematic reviews, 9 meta-analyses, and 4 clinical guideline reviews. We adopted the SIGN checklist for the assessment of article quality. Data were subsequently abstracted by a reviewer and verified. Many treatment options exist for LBP, with a variety of recommendation grades. We assessed the recommendation grade for general behavior, pharmacological therapy, psychological therapy, and specific exercises. This information should be helpful to physicians in the treatment of LBP patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbd4","authors":["Jae-Young Hong","Kwang-Sup Song","Jae Hwan Cho","Jae Hyup Lee"],"doi":"10.4184\/asj.2017.11.4.653","first_seen_on":"2017-09-07T10:07:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1976-1902","1976-7846"],"issue":"4","journal":"Asian Spine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1504778840,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28874985?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC5573861","pmid":"28874985","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"An Updated Overview of Low Back Pain Management in Primary Care","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/updated-overview-low-back-pain-management-primary-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380430,"mean":7.062242681602,"rank":7244380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122995,"mean":12.10381830008,"rank":100017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122995,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.4918103448276,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/painmanwise\/statuses\/905734218424168449","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24897829],"posted_on":"2017-09-07T10:07:20+00:00","author":{"name":"painmanwise","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514094062056390656\/ORtXawZi_normal.png","id_on_source":"painmanwise","tweeter_id":"2826634074","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":131},"tweet_id":"905734218424168449"}]}}
