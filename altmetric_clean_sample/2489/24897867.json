It has become clear that the generation of these cells is highly dependent upon tissue-specific cues derived from the microenvironment that, in turn, regulate unique differentiation programs. Recently, a role for GATA6 has emerged in the differentiation programming of resident peritoneal macrophages. We identify a critical role for mTOR in integrating cues from the tissue microenvironment in regulating differentiation and metabolic reprogramming. Specifically, inhibition of mTORC2 leads to enhanced GATA6 expression in a FOXO1 dependent fashion. Functionally, inhibition of mTORC2 promotes peritoneal resident macrophage generation in the resolution phase during zymosan-induced peritonitis. Also, mTORC2-deficient peritoneal resident macrophages displayed increased functionality and metabolic reprogramming. Notably, mTORC2 activation distinguishes tissue-resident macrophage proliferation and differentiation from that of M2 macrophages. Overall, our data implicate a selective role for mTORC2 in the differentiation of tissue-resident macrophages.","altmetric_jid":"52d545303cf058dd068b4567","authors":["Min-Hee Oh","Samuel L.
