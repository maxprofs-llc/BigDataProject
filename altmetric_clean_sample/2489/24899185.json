What is currently missing are means to efficiently explore, exchange and present the massive amount of acquired, and often time dependent root phenotypes.\nIn this work, we present visual summaries of root ensembles by aggregating root images with identical genetic characteristics. We use the generalized box plot concept with a new formulation of data depth. In addition to spatial distributions, we created a visual representation to encode temporal distributions associated with the development of root individuals.\nThe new formulation of data depth allows for much faster implementation close to interactive frame rates. This allows us to present the statistics from bootstrapping that characterize the root sample set quality. As a positive side effect of the new data-depth formulation we are able to define the geometric median for the curve ensemble, which was well received by the domain experts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Viktor Vad","Douglas Cedrim","Wolfgang Busch","Peter Filzmoser","Ivan Viola"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12859-016-1445-3","first_seen_on":"2017-09-07T10:49:10+00:00","issns":["1471-2105"],"issue":"Suppl 2","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1504780653,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28251866?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28251866","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Algorithms","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Appl. in Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Generalized box-plot for root growth ensembles","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/generalized-boxplot-root-growth-ensembles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380430,"mean":7.062242681602,"rank":7244414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123068,"mean":12.096973420982,"rank":100047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123068,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3648,"mean":5.0120488072388,"rank":3383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3648,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":4.4278222222222,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/statuses\/905741825419313152","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24899185],"posted_on":"2017-09-07T10:37:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
