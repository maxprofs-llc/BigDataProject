Patients (18-80 years old) hospitalized for coronary (index) event during preceding 3 years were identified from hospital records and interviewed \u22656 months later. Patient information regarding index event was acquired from hospital records. Anamnesis was obtained during the interview, and physical examination and laboratory analyses were performed.\nMedian age at the index coronary event was 58.8 years, and it was significantly decreased compared with last EUROASPIRE-III study (60.5 years), which was conducted at the same centers 6 years earlier (p=0.017). Of all patients, 19.3% were under 50 years of age and mean age was lower than that of EUROASPIRE-IV Europe (62.5 years). Comparing EUROASPIRE-IV Turkey with EUROASPIRE-III Turkey, rate of smokers increased to 25.5% from 23.1% (p=0.499), obesity increased to 40.7% from 35.5% (p=0.211), total cholesterol level increased to 49.6% from 48.3% (p=0.767), and diabetes rate increased to 39.7% from 33.6% (p=0.139), however none of the differences reached a level of statistical significance. Only 11.7% of the smokers quit after coronary event. Rates for these factors were lower in EUROASPIRE-IV Europe (16% for smoking, 37.6% for obesity, and 26.8% for diabetes).\nEUROASPIRE-IV Turkey data revealed that secondary prevention was unsatisfactory and had progressed unfavorably compared with last EUROASPIRE study, some risk factors were more uncontrolled than overall European average, and coronary artery events at young age remain an important problem.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccd0","authors":["Tokg\u00f6zo\u011flu, Lale","Kay\u0131k\u00e7\u0131o\u011flu, Meral","Altay, Servet","Aydo\u011fdu, Sinan","Bar\u00e7\u0131n, Cem","Bostan, Cem","\u00c7akmak, H\u00fcseyin Altu\u011f","\u00c7atako\u011flu, Alp Burak","Emet, Samim","Ergene, Oktay","Kalkan, Ali Kemal","Kaya, Bar\u0131\u015f","Tulunay Kaya, Cans\u0131n","Kaymaz, Cihangir","Koylan, Nevrez","K\u00fclt\u00fcrsay, Hakan","O\u011fuz, Aytekin","\u00d6zpelit, Ebru","\u00dcnl\u00fc, Serkan"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-07T10:34:10+00:00","issns":["1308-4488"],"issue":"2","journal":"T\u00fcrk Kardiyoloji Derne\u011fi ar\u015fivi T\u00fcrk Kardiyoloji Derne\u011finin yay\u0131n organ\u0131d\u0131r","last_mentioned_on":1504779364,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28424435?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28424435","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"[EUROASPIRE-IV: European Society of Cardiology study of lifestyle, risk factors, and treatment approaches in patients with coronary artery disease: Data from Turkey].","type":"article","volume":"45"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380430,"mean":7.062242681602,"rank":4472508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2332235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380430,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123018,"mean":12.101646341563,"rank":66560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":44140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123018,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":0.72201834862385,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sup_CVD\/statuses\/905736417887653888","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24898278],"posted_on":"2017-09-07T10:16:04+00:00","author":{"name":"sup_cvd","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"Whatsup Cardiovascular Disease?
