Two (0.9%) out of 222 shelter cats from Seoul, Korea, yielded positive results for the A. phagocytophilum 16S rRNA, groEL, and msp2 genes. Phylogenetic analysis divided groEL gene sequences into two groups (alanine and serine), based on their nucleotide and amino acid sequences. A. phagocytophilum msp2 gene sequences were grouped per the region of isolation (Europe vs. USA, including Korea). Some nucleotide and amino acid sequences of groEL and msp2 showed distinctive patterns according to the region of isolation, which helped in distinguishing A. phagocytophilum gene sequences detected in Korea from those detected in the USA and Europe. Although the limited number of clinical anaplasmosis cases caused by A. phagocytophilum belonging to the alanine group prevents any firm conclusions, the results of the present study tend to refute the previous view that the pathogenicity of A. phagocytophilum is associated with the serine group. Moreover, our results suggest that genetic analyses of groEL and msp2 can be used to obtain a regional fingerprint of A. phagocytophilum.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ac3","authors":["Seung-Hun Lee","Dorene VanBik","Neung-Hee Kim","Sang-Joon Park","Oh-Deog Kwon","Tae-Hwan Kim","Dongmi Kwak"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.meegid.2016.10.025","first_seen_on":"2016-10-31T14:00:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["15671348","1567-7257"],"journal":"Infection, Genetics & Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1477922393,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1567134816304348"],"pmid":"27876614","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","communicablediseases","genetics"],"title":"First molecular detection and genetic analysis of Anaplasma phagocytophilum in shelter cats in Seoul, Korea","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/first-molecular-detection-genetic-analysis-anaplasma-phagocytophilum-shelter-cats-seoul-korea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7625034,"mean":6.5623772256419,"rank":6600147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7625034,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233783,"mean":12.781405403324,"rank":189939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233783,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1163,"mean":2.206065404475,"rank":907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1163,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.8223913043478,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/793090118856896512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13193503],"posted_on":"2016-10-31T13:59:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2117},"tweet_id":"793090118856896512"}]}}
