Platelet derived growth factor \u03b2 receptor (PDGF\u03b2R) is a tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) with a potential role in human breast cancer and a series of canine tumours. In this study we demonstrated, for the first time, expression of PDGF\u03b2R and its downstream transduction molecules, mitogen-activated protein\/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), as well as their activated forms in canine mammary tumours by both biochemical analysis and immunohistochemistry. PDGF\u03b2R was expressed and hyperphosphorylated in the majority of tumour samples and tumour derived cell lines. Additionally, both MEK and ERK were expressed and activated in cell lines as well as biopsies. TKR inhibitors (TKRi) are currently under investigation as possible therapy in human breast and several canine tumours, thus our in vivo and in vitro findings pave the way for future studies aimed at establishing a potential therapeutic employment of TKRi for the treatment of canine mammary cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000346b","authors":["Gennaro Altamura","Barbara degli Uberti","Giorgio Galiero","Manuela Martano","Antonella Pirro","Marco Russo","Giuseppe Borzacchiello"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rvsc.2016.10.014","first_seen_on":"2016-10-31T14:17:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00345288","1532-2661"],"journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","last_mentioned_on":1486088460,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0034528816305240"],"pmid":"28159233","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Expression and activation of platelet-derived growth factor \u03b2 receptor, mitogen-activated protein\/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in canine mammary tumours","type":"article","volume":"110"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":6193973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1096836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240901,"mean":13.030774122042,"rank":168037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240901,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":786,"mean":1.4776917197452,"rank":361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":786,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.6815789473684,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/793094503473225728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13193923],"posted_on":"2016-10-31T14:17:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2106},"tweet_id":"793094503473225728"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet\/statuses\/793287949328744448","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13193923],"posted_on":"2016-11-01T03:06:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Oncologiavet","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/849456038709538817\/jJ9c5Y2Q_normal.jpg","description":"Francisco Alvarez Berger DVM MSc DACVIM (Oncology) - Veterinary oncology","id_on_source":"oncologiavet","tweeter_id":"167392151","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":4483},"tweet_id":"793287949328744448"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet\/statuses\/793289285076082688","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13193923],"posted_on":"2016-11-01T03:11:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Oncologiavet","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/849456038709538817\/jJ9c5Y2Q_normal.jpg","description":"Francisco Alvarez Berger DVM MSc DACVIM (Oncology) - Veterinary oncology","id_on_source":"oncologiavet","tweeter_id":"167392151","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":4483},"tweet_id":"793289285076082688"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet\/statuses\/827341086653874182","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13193923],"posted_on":"2017-02-03T02:21:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Oncologiavet","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/oncologiavet","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/849456038709538817\/jJ9c5Y2Q_normal.jpg","description":"Francisco Alvarez Berger DVM MSc DACVIM (Oncology) - Veterinary oncology","id_on_source":"oncologiavet","tweeter_id":"167392151","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":4483},"tweet_id":"827341086653874182"}]}}
