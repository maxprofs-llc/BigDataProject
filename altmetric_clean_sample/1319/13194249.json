The as-obtained materials have significantly enhanced electronic conductivity; 20\u2005times higher than that of as-synthesized TiO2 material. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements are performed to validate the low charge carrier resistance of the oxygen-deficient TiOx . The resulting oxygen-deficient TiOx battery anode exhibits a high reversible capacity (\u223c180\u2005mA\u2009h\u2009g(-1) at a discharge\/charge rate of 1\u2005C\/1\u2005C after 400\u2005cycles) and an excellent rate capability (\u223c90\u2005mA\u2009h\u2009g(-1) even at a rate of 10\u2009C). Also, the full cell, which is coupled with a LiCoO2 cathode material, exhibits an outstanding rate capability (>75\u2005mA\u2009h\u2009g(-1) at a rate of 3.0\u2005C) and maintains a reversible capacity of over 100\u2005mA\u2009h\u2009g(-1) at a discharge\/charge of 1\u2005C\/1\u2005C for 300\u2005cycles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Song, Woo\u2010Jin","Yoo, Seungmin","Lee, Jung\u2010In","Han, Jung\u2010Gu","Son, Yeonguk","Kim, Sun\u2010I","Shin, Myoungsoo","Choi, Sinho","Jang, Ji\u2010Hyun","Cho, Jaephil","Choi, Nam\u2010Soon","Park, Soojin"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201601061","endpage":"3388","first_seen_on":"2016-10-31T14:33:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1861-471X","18614728"],"issue":"23","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1477924394,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201601061\/abstract;jsessionid=661A03BDC76142A11F8241CB1504447D.f01t04","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201601061?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201601061"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201601061\/pdf","pmid":"27661460","pubdate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"3382","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              Zinc-Reduced Mesoporous TiO\n              \n                x\n              \n              Li-Ion Battery Anodes with Exceptional Rate Capability and Cycling Stability\n            ","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zincreduced-mesoporous-tio-sub-ixi-sub-liion-battery-anodes-exceptional-rate-capability-cycling-stab"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7625034,"mean":6.5623772256419,"rank":5769044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1024931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7625034,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233783,"mean":12.781393426354,"rank":161475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233783,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2350,"mean":1.3692234993614,"rank":869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2350,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":1.4220930232558,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemAsianJ\/statuses\/793098510568742912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13194249],"posted_on":"2016-10-31T14:33:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Chem.
