The investigations assessed the activities of the agents for the inhibition of cholinesterases (AChE and BuChE), the inhibition of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) self-assembly, and the catalysis of the disassembly of preformed A\u03b2 oligomers and measured their antioxidant activities. Our results demonstrate that most of the synthesized compounds demonstrated good inhibitory activity against AChE with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. In particular, compounds 9 (IC50\u00a0=\u00a014.8\u00a0nM) and 14 (IC50\u00a0=\u00a018.6\u00a0nM) exhibited markedly higher inhibitory activities than tacrine and similar activities to donepezil. In addition, 9 and 14 significantly inhibited A\u03b2 aggregation (inhibition rates of 85.5% and 83.8%, respectively), catalysed the disaggregation of A\u03b2 fibrils generated by self-induced A\u03b2 aggregation, and exhibited antioxidant activity. Furthermore, these two compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in\u00a0vitro. These properties highlight the potential of these new compounds to be developed as multi-functional drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["Ling Huang","Hui Miao","Yang Sun","Fanchao Meng","Xingshu Li"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2014.09.081","first_seen_on":"2014-10-06T10:01:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1768-3254"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1437818946,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25282266?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25282266?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25282266","pubdate":"2014-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Discovery of indanone derivatives as multi-target-directed ligands against Alzheimer's disease.","type":"article","volume":"87C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/discovery-indanone-derivatives-multitargetdirected-ligands-against-alzheimers-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561630,"mean":6.0798051118097,"rank":2916065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3469282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561630,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165489,"mean":8.306460625544,"rank":77204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":81577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165489,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":906,"mean":1.4491977900552,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":906,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":0.65967741935484,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
