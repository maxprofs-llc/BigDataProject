Genetic risk factors may underlie the disparity in disease prevalence. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified\u00a0>60 common genetic variants that contribute to T2D risk in populations of European, Asian, African and Hispanic descent. These studies have not comprehensively examined population differences in cumulative risk allele load. To investigate the relationship between risk allele load and T2D risk, 46 T2D single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 43 loci from GWAS in European, Asian, and African-derived populations were genotyped in 1,990 African Americans (n\u00a0=\u00a0963 T2D cases, n\u00a0=\u00a01,027 controls) and 1,644 European Americans (n\u00a0=\u00a0719 T2D cases, n\u00a0=\u00a0925 controls) ascertained and recruited using a common protocol in the southeast United States. A genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed from the cumulative risk alleles for each individual. In African American subjects, risk allele frequencies ranged from 0.024 to 0.964. Risk alleles from 26 SNPs demonstrated directional consistency with previous studies, and 3 SNPs from ADAMTS9, TCF7L2, and ZFAND6 showed nominal evidence of association (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). African American individuals carried 38-67 (53.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0, mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) risk alleles. In European American subjects, risk allele frequencies ranged from 0.084 to 0.996. Risk alleles from 36 SNPs demonstrated directional consistency, and 10 SNPs from BCL11A, PSMD6, ADAMTS9, ZFAND3, ANK1, CDKN2A\/B, TCF7L2, PRC1, FTO, and BCAR1 showed evidence of association (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). European American individuals carried 38-65 (50.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4) risk alleles. African Americans have a significantly greater burden of 2.8 risk alleles (p\u00a0=\u00a03.97\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-89)) compared to European Americans. However, GRS modeling showed that cumulative risk allele load was associated with risk of T2D in European Americans, but only marginally in African Americans. This result suggests that there are ethnic-specific differences in genetic architecture underlying T2D, and that these differences complicate our understanding of how risk allele load impacts disease susceptibility.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a0d","authors":["Keaton JM","Cooke Bailey JN","Palmer ND","Freedman BI","Langefeld CD","Ng MC","Bowden DW","Jacob M.
