We conducted a 24 month prospective study in 30 patients clinically asymptomatic, infected by the VIH1, with a rate of CD4 above 200\/mm3, and naive of any antiretroviral treatment. Every patient received a supplementation in antioxidants by drinking every two days during twelve monthsherb tea issued from Alternanthera pungens. Venous sampling of blood was used to measure biomarkers of oxidative (malondialdehyde - MDA - and advanced oxidation protein end products - AOPP), T lymphocytes, amimotransferases and creatinine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069eb","authors":["Djohan Y","Camara C","Mond\u00e9 A","Koffi G","Niamk\u00e9 G","D\u00e9r\u00e9 L","Tiahou G","Djessou P","Sess D"],"doi":"10.1684\/abc.2009.0362","first_seen_on":"2014-10-05T03:44:52+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Annales de Biologie Clinique","last_mentioned_on":1412491373,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/19789129\/"],"pmid":"19789129","pubdate":"2008-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"[Interest of antioxidants in the care of the patients infected by the HIV: the experience of long term administration of Alternanthera pungens herb tea].","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interest-antioxidants-care-patients-infected-hiv-experience-long-term-administration-alternanthera-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1865472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2587398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120097,"mean":8.2379528710367,"rank":43891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":74641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120097,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":1.23,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EricaMcIntyre\/status\/518652528867561472","license":"datasift","rt":["NurtureNatro"],"citation_ids":[2742868],"posted_on":"2014-10-05T06:42:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Erica McIntyre","url":"https:\/\/ericamcintyre.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/893019195348205568\/Keuj8Qmf_normal.jpg","description":"@UTSARCCIM Researcher in psychology and public health, interested in mental health and health behaviour.
