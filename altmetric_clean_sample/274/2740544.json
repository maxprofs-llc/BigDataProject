This review will summarize several applications involving the Lorentz force, including (1) magneto-acoustic imaging of current; (2) 'Hall effect' imaging; (3) ultrasonically-induced Lorentz force imaging of conductivity; (4) magneto-acoustic tomography with magnetic induction; and (5) Lorentz force imaging of action currents using magnetic resonance imaging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b7","authors":["Bradley J Roth"],"doi":"10.1258\/ebm.2010.010236","first_seen_on":"2014-10-03T20:36:12+00:00","issns":["1535-3702"],"issue":"2","journal":"Experimental Biology and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1412380619,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3079438\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3079438","pmid":"21321309","pubdate":"2011-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"132","subjects":["medicine","biology","physiology"],"title":"The Role of Magnetic Forces in Biology and Medicine","type":"article","volume":"236","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-magnetic-forces-biology-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1983812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2421871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119786,"mean":8.2076483699964,"rank":47485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":69022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119786,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":530,"mean":2.8703894139887,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":530,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.4573333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
