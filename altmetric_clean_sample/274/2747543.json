My intention was 2-fold: (1) to introduce myself, so that our vast Magnet\u00ae communities could get to know me as a person and leader; and (2) to listen to those who were energized about the possibilities of being a part of the next generation of Magnet standards. This past year, my journey took me all over the country and all over the world, to international communities in France, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. What I learned about the resilience and the strength of nursing all around the globe was both heartwarming and amazing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e89","doi":"10.1097\/nna.0000000000000114","first_seen_on":"2014-10-07T00:53:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-0443"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Nursing Administration","last_mentioned_on":1412696282,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonajournal\/Abstract\/2014\/10000\/Magnet__Listening_Tour_2013_2014.1.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jonajournal\/2014\/10000\/Magnet__Listening_Tour_2013_2014.1.pdf","pmid":"25280071","pubdate":"2014-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"495","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Magnet\u00ae Listening Tour 2013-2014","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/magnet-listening-tour-20132014"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4734919,"mean":5.4827829794683,"rank":1815022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2892185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4734919,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123680,"mean":8.7377174136272,"rank":42066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":80639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123680,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":768,"mean":2.378925684485,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":768,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.0866666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MountSinaiNurse\/status\/519511980806533120","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2747543],"posted_on":"2014-10-07T15:38:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Mount Sinai Nurse","url":"http:\/\/www.mountsinai.org\/health-professionals\/nursing","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/527089690499756033\/T7gp7P9v_normal.jpeg","description":"Third consecutive national recognition for excellence in nursing from the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) Magnet Recognition Program\u00ae.","id_on_source":"MountSinaiNurse","tweeter_id":"2651485088","geo":{"lt":"40.7305991","ln":"-73.9865812","country":"US"},"followers":232},"tweet_id":"519511980806533120"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JONAonline\/status\/519289074863964160","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2747543],"posted_on":"2014-10-07T00:52:18+00:00","author":{"name":"JONA Online","url":"http:\/\/www.jonajournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/776224856132071424\/RNoVmrnl_normal.jpg","description":"JONA\u2122 is the authoritative source of information on developments and advances in patient care leadership. #JONANurseLeader","id_on_source":"JONAonline","tweeter_id":"194146435","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1183},"tweet_id":"519289074863964160"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ANCCMagCon\/status\/519301132683075584","license":"datasift","rt":["JONAonline"],"citation_ids":[2747543],"posted_on":"2014-10-07T01:40:12+00:00","author":{"name":"ANCC Magnet Conf","url":"http:\/\/nursecredentialing.org\/MagnetConference","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/458666290857529344\/ByZG-BGU_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"ANCCMagCon","tweeter_id":"2458484635","geo":{"lt":"32.7801052","ln":"-96.8000082","country":"US"},"followers":108},"tweet_id":"519301132683075584"}]}}
