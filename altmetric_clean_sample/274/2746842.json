Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with an increased risk for hospital admission and\/or mortality (particularly those related to severe liver disease) compared to the general population. The aim of this study was to assess the mortality among HIV-infected patients in ICU, and to evaluate the impact of HIV\/HCV coinfection and severe sepsis on ICU mortality.MethodsWe carried out a retrospective study based on patients admitted to ICU who were recorded in the Minimum Basic Data Set (2005-2010) in Spain. HIV-infected patients (All-HIV-group (n\u00bf=\u00bf1891)) were divided into two groups: HIV-monoinfected patients (HIV-group (n\u00bf=\u00bf1191)) and HIV\/HCV-coinfected patients (HIV\/HCV-group (n\u00bf=\u00bf700)). A control group (HIV(-)\/HCV(-)) was also included (n\u00bf=\u00bf7496).ResultsAll-HIV-group had higher frequencies of severe sepsis (57.7% vs. 39.4%; p\u00bf<\u00bf0.001) than control group. Overall, ICU mortality in patients with severe sepsis was much more frequent than in patients without severe sepsis (other causes) at days 30 and 90 in HIV-infected patients and control group (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.001). Moreover, all-HIV-group in presence or absence of severe sepsis had a higher percentage of death than control group at days 7 (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.001), 30 (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.001) and 90 (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.001). Besides, HIV\/HCV-group had a higher percentage of death both in patients with severe sepsis, and in patients without severe sepsis compared to HIV-group at days 7 (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.001) and 30 (p\u00bf<\u00bf0.001); while no differences were found at day 90. In a Bayesian competing risk model, HIV\/HCV-group had higher mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)\u00bf=\u00bf1.44 (95%CI\u00bf=\u00bf1.30-1.59) and aHR\u00bf=\u00bf1.57 (95%CI\u00bf=\u00bf1.38-1.78) for patients with and without severe sepsis, respectively).ConclusionsHIV infection was related to higher frequency of severe sepsis and death among patients admitted to the ICU. Besides, HIV\/HCV coinfection contributed to an increased risk of death in both presence and absence of severe sepsis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000805","authors":["Jos\u00e9 Medrano","Alejando \u00c1lvaro-Meca","Alexandre Boyer","Mar\u00eda A Jim\u00e9nez-Sousa","Salvador Resino"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13054-014-0475-3","first_seen_on":"2014-10-06T19:11:07+00:00","issns":["1364-8535"],"issue":"4","journal":"Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1414138095,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4176576\/?report=classic"],"pmid":"25159592","pubdate":"2014-10-06T20:14:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Mortality of patients infected with HIV in the intensive care unit (2005 through 2010): significant role of chronic hepatitis C and severe sepsis","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mortality-patients-infected-hiv-intensive-care-unit-2005-through-2010-significant-role-chronic-hepat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":3553490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":836995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138641,"mean":8.6373381130989,"rank":94299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":27283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138641,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2698,"mean":7.2339933259177,"rank":2277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2698,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":6.0022714285714,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
