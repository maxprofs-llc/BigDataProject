Eighteen patients with postthoracotomy neuropathic pain were exposed to placebo and nocebo manipulations, in which they received open and hidden administrations of pain-relieving (lidocaine) or pain-inducing (capsaicin) treatment controlled for the natural history of pain. Immediately after the open administration, patients rated their expected pain levels on a mechanical visual analogue scale (M-VAS). They also reported their emotional feelings via a quantitative\/qualitative experiential method. Subsequently, patients rated their ongoing pain levels on the M-VAS and underwent quantitative sensory testing of evoked pain (brush, pinprick, area of hyperalgesia, wind-up-like pain). There was a significant placebo effect on both ongoing (P=.009 to .019) and evoked neuropathic pain (P=.0005 to .053). Expected pain levels accounted for significant amounts of the variance in ongoing (53.4%) and evoked pain (up to 34.5%) after the open lidocaine administration. Furthermore, patients reported high levels of positive and low levels of negative emotional feelings in the placebo condition compared with the nocebo condition (P\u2a7d.001). Pain increases during nocebo were nonsignificant (P=.394 to 1.000). To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate placebo effects in ongoing neuropathic pain. It provides further evidence for placebo-induced reduction in hyperalgesia and suggests that patients' expectations coexist with emotional feelings about treatments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003281","doi":"10.1016\/j.pain.2014.09.036","first_seen_on":"2014-10-06T10:30:36+00:00","funders":["wellcome"],"issns":["03043959","1872-6623","0304-3959"],"journal":"Pain (03043959)","last_mentioned_on":1431327193,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S030439591400459X","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25281929","http:\/\/www.painjournalonline.com\/article\/S0304-3959(14)00459-X\/abstract","http:\/\/www.painjournalonline.com\/article\/S0304-3959(14)00459-X\/abstract?utm_content=10127887&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter"],"pmid":"25281929","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Expectations and positive emotional feelings accompany reductions in ongoing and evoked neuropathic pain following placebo interventions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expectations-positive-emotional-feelings-accompany-reductions-ongoing-evoked-neuropathic-pain-follow"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5085441,"mean":6.0243406619703,"rank":1008451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4072387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5085441,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140970,"mean":8.5850525860297,"rank":32869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":107913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140970,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2517,"mean":7.0038354531002,"rank":782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":1730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2517,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":5.3957358490566,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
