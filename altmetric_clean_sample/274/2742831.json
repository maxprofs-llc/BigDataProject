The organization of mitochondrial (mt) genomes varies between the two species of booklice investigated in the genus Liposcelis. Liposcelis decolor has its mt genes on a single chromosome, like most other insects; L. bostrychophila, however, has a multipartite mt genome with genes on two chromosomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Chen SC","Wei DD","Shao R","Shi JX","Dou W","Wang JJ"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-15-861","first_seen_on":"2014-10-05T03:03:53+00:00","issns":["1471-2164",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1412490807,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/15\/861\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-15-861.pdf","pmid":"25282613","pubdate":"2014-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"861","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Evolution of multipartite mitochondrial genomes in the booklice of the genus Liposcelis (Psocoptera)","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolution-multipartite-mitochondrial-genomes-booklice-genus-liposcelis-psocoptera"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1912407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2551147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120096,"mean":8.3826863732882,"rank":46534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":71719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120096,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113,"mean":3.4258589494163,"rank":1778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289,"mean":4.0949375,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":7}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PharmaNews4\/status\/518597262084440064","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2742831],"posted_on":"2014-10-05T03:03:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Pharma News","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/425958784125509632\/d-Hqe9mN_normal.jpeg","description":"Pharma Research, Drug Discovery, Pharmacology, Biotechnology, Microbiology...","id_on_source":"PharmaNews4","tweeter_id":"2304712068","followers":5},"tweet_id":"518597262084440064"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Science_News1\/status\/518608750656356352","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2742831],"posted_on":"2014-10-05T03:48:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Science News","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/426309372818366464\/gn6U36oS_normal.jpeg","description":"The latest live science news: medicine, health, pharma and biology","id_on_source":"Science_News1","tweeter_id":"2304792937","followers":7},"tweet_id":"518608750656356352"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PharmaAndHealth\/status\/518611506507055105","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2742831],"posted_on":"2014-10-05T03:59:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Pharma & Health","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/425969952814673920\/g35LU49b_normal.jpeg","description":"Latest health, medical and pharmaceutical news","id_on_source":"PharmaAndHealth","tweeter_id":"2304768685","followers":2},"tweet_id":"518611506507055105"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/7Journals\/status\/518650154379784192","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2742831],"posted_on":"2014-10-05T06:33:27+00:00","author":{"name":"7Journals","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/323301047\/7journals-com_normal.jpg","description":"Online Edition of the #Journals and #Commentary","id_on_source":"7Journals","tweeter_id":"58580755","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":264},"tweet_id":"518650154379784192"}]}}
