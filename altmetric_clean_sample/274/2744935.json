Compared to the generation of stably transformed plants, agroinfiltration is more rapid, and samples can be analyzed a few days after inoculation. Nevertheless, at difference of tobacco and other plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana remains recalcitrant to routine transient assays. In this chapter, we describe a transient expression assay using simple infiltration of intact Arabidopsis leaves with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying a plasmid expressing a reporter fluorescent protein. In this protocol, Agrobacterium aggressiveness was increased by a prolonged treatment in an induction medium deficient in nutrients and containing acetosyringone. Besides, Arabidopsis plants were cultivated in intermediate photoperiod (12 h light-12 h dark) to promote leaf growth.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Silvina Mangano","Cintia Daniela Gonzalez","Silvana Petruccelli"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-62703-580-4_8","first_seen_on":"2014-10-06T05:20:17+00:00","issns":["1064-3745"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1412572795,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007%2F978-1-62703-580-4_8"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F978-1-62703-580-4_8.pdf","pmid":"24057365","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Humana Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gene Expression","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transient Transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana Leaves","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007%2F978-1-62703-580-4_8","volume":"1062","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agrobacterium-tumefaciensmediated-transient-transformation-arabidopsis-thaliana-leaves"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4335299,"mean":4.931929451188,"rank":3406334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":126282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4335299,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116597,"mean":7.9084673402176,"rank":90339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116597,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2935,"mean":1.4779127471029,"rank":1745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2935,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.5123880597015,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
