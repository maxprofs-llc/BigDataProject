Genome-wide complex trait analysis estimates that common genetic variants account for about 24% of the variation contributing to liability for AD. It is also estimated that 24% of the variance of non-pathological cognitive aging is accounted for by common single nucleotide polymorphisms. However, although the APOE locus is associated with both AD and cognitive aging, it is not known to what extent other common genetic variants, with smaller effect sizes that influence both, overlap. We test the hypothesis that polygenic risk for AD is associated with cognitive ability and cognitive change in about 3,000 non-demented older people (Cognitive Ageing Genetics England and Scotland-CAGES-consortium). We found no significant association of polygenic risk for AD with cognitive ability or cognitive change in CAGES, indicating that the genetic etiologies of AD and non-pathological cognitive decline differ.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Harris SE","Davies G","Luciano M","Payton A","Fox HC","Haggarty P","Ollier W","Horan M","Porteous DJ","Starr JM","Whalley LJ","Pendleton N","Deary IJ"],"doi":"10.3233\/jad-131058","first_seen_on":"2014-10-07T10:15:00+00:00","funders":["wellcome","mrc","bbsrc","csouk"],"issns":["1387-2877"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","last_mentioned_on":1412676853,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24246418?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24246418","pubdate":"2013-11-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"Polygenic Risk for Alzheimer's Disease is not Associated with Cognitive Ability or Cognitive Aging in Non-Demented Older People.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polygenic-risk-alzheimers-disease-not-associated-cognitive-ability-cognitive-aging-nondemented-older"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681163,"mean":5.6987966927893,"rank":2490637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1553097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681163,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124487,"mean":8.8433630287744,"rank":65228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":44895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124487,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1307,"mean":7.9495405819296,"rank":895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1307,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":5.4672368421053,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":2,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":2,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nailest_papers\/status\/519430489791528960","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2748925],"posted_on":"2014-10-07T10:14:13+00:00","author":{"name":"andy","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"Experimenting with automatically posting links to academic papers of interest, mostly from rss feeds via ifttt.
