No definite relationship between muscular weakness of the hip abductors and the development of Iliotibial Band Syndrome or different ratios between hip adduction to abduction have been reported so far. Isokinetic measurements were taken from 10 healthy runners and 10 runners with Iliotibial Band Syndrome. Primary outcome variables were concentric, eccentric, and isometric peak torque of the hip abductors and adductors at 30 degrees\/s, and a concentric endurance quotient at the same angle velocity. Differences in muscle strength of the hip abductors between healthy (CO) and injured runners (ITBS) were not statistically significant in any of the muscle functions tested. Both groups showed the same strength differences between hip adduction and abduction, and increased strength in hip adduction. Weakness of hip abductors does not seem to play a role in the etiology of Iliotibial Band Syndrome in runners, since dynamic and static strength measurements did not differ between groups, and differences between hip abduction and adduction were the same. Strengthening of hip abductors seems to have little effect on the prevention of Iliotibial Band Syndrome in runners.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ba9","authors":["S Grau","I Krauss","C Maiwald","R Best","T Horstmann"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-2007-989323","first_seen_on":"2014-10-04T16:22:35+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0172-4622"],"issue":"7","journal":"International Journal of Sports Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1412439675,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/18050060\/"],"pmid":"18050060","pubdate":"2008-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Hip abductor weakness is not the cause for iliotibial band syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hip-abductor-weakness-not-cause-iliotibial-band-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4327521,"mean":4.9494520665238,"rank":2379243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1207079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4327521,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115908,"mean":7.9302759108597,"rank":62311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":35059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115908,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":842,"mean":5.311063020214,"rank":531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":842,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":11.870909090909,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
