Our objective was to explain the pharmacokinetics of OLAI to provide clinical insight. Simulation models and data from clinical trials are presented. Olanzapine concentrations were observed immediately upon injection. Half-life was \u223c30 days, controlled by the slow rate of intramuscular absorption rather than the 30-h elimination rate-based half-life of oral olanzapine. As each injection builds on the drug still being released from previous injections, concentrations increase gradually until a steady state is reached after \u223c3 months. Concentrations were similar to oral olanzapine and proportional to the dose; the average steady-state concentrations (10th-90th percentile) for the 150, 210, and 300 mg\/2-week doses were 16-32, 15-55, and 20-67 ng\/ml, respectively, and those for the 300 and 405 mg\/4-week doses were 19-48 and 19-62 ng\/ml, respectively. Peak concentrations most often occurred at 2-4 days after injection. Peak-to-trough fluctuation was greater for the 4-week dosing interval than the 2-week one, with no apparent clinical ramifications for these differences. Trough concentrations were above the lower end of the therapeutic range, even at the first injection. Long-term use up to 6 years indicated no additional accumulation. The impact of smoking and sex was similar, but less pronounced than for oral olanzapine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61c3cf058f6100077df","authors":["Stephan Heres","Susanne Kraemer","Richard F.
