Brazzein is 2,000 times sweeter than sucrose in comparison to 2% sucrose aqueous solution and 500 times in comparison to 10% of the sugar. Its taste is more similar to sucrose than that of thaumatin. Its sweetness is not destroyed by 80 degrees C for 4 h. Brazzein is comprised of 54 amino acid residues, corresponding to a molecular mass of 6,473 Da.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["D Ming","G Hellekant"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-04T21:48:11+00:00","issns":["0014-5793"],"issue":"1","journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1420130235,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7957951","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/0014-5793(94)01184-2"],"pmid":"7957951","pubdate":"1994-11-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Brazzein, a new high-potency thermostable sweet protein from Pentadiplandra brazzeana B.","type":"article","volume":"355","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brazzein-new-highpotency-thermostable-sweet-protein-pentadiplandra-brazzeana-b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":693399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3990850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122021,"mean":8.6428550073759,"rank":24083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":97846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122021,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3885,"mean":2.4213990731205,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":3783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3885,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.281125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
