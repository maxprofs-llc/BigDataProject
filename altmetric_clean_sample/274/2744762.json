Trapping occurred during the summer of 2009-2012 at field sites surrounding Big Bear Lake, CA, a region where human infection has been reported for many years. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we tested 207 rodents from 11 species and found chipmunks (Tamias spp.) and a woodrat (Neotoma macrotis) infected. Chipmunks represented the majority of captures at these sites. Sixteen of the 207 (7.7%; CI = 4.6-12.4) animals were qPCR-positive for Borrelia spp. associated with relapsing fever, and of those, we obtained bacterial DNA sequences from eight. The phylogram made from these sequences depict a clear association with B. hermsii genomic group I. In addition, we identified an infection with Borrelia coriaceae in a Tamias merriami, a potentially nonpathogenic member of the tick-borne relapsing fever group. Our findings support the hypothesis that chipmunk species play an important role in the maintenance of Borrelia species that cause tick-borne relapsing fever in the western United States, and therefore the risk of infection to people.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006651","authors":["Nieto NC","Teglas MB"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-06T02:48:11+00:00","funders":["niaid","niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Medical Entomology","last_mentioned_on":1412563593,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25276933"],"pmid":"25276933","pubdate":"2014-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Relapsing fever group Borrelia in Southern California rodents.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relapsing-fever-group-borrelia-southern-california-rodents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4335299,"mean":4.931929451188,"rank":3406167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":126172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4335299,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116597,"mean":7.8833577138153,"rank":90277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116597,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":565,"mean":5.0275390070922,"rank":454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":565,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.4921052631579,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CampOther\/status\/518955442672656385","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2744762],"posted_on":"2014-10-06T02:46:33+00:00","author":{"name":"cAMP \u00d6ther","url":"http:\/\/campother.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/418967192097419264\/b84KterR_normal.jpeg","description":"Discussing tickborne infections, immunology, science, medical controversy, media portrayal of chronic illness, and the patient experience since 2010.","id_on_source":"CampOther","tweeter_id":"258870463","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1880},"tweet_id":"518955442672656385"}]}}
