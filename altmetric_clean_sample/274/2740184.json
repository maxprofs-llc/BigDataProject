Defects in either result in severe congenital heart disease; however, little is known about the interplay between these two crucial developmental processes. Here, we show that AVJ conduction delay is locally assigned by the morphogenetic events that initiate valve formation. Our data demonstrate that physical separation from endocardial-derived factors prevents AVJ myocardium from becoming fast conducting. Mechanistically, this physical separation is induced by myocardial-derived factors that support cardiac jelly deposition at the onset of valve formation. These data offer a novel paradigm for conduction patterning, whereby reciprocal myocardial-endocardial interactions coordinate the processes of valve formation with establishment of conduction delay. This, in turn, synchronizes the electrophysiological and structural events necessary for the optimization of blood flow through the developing heart.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","authors":["Michael Bressan","PoAn Brian Yang","Jonathan D Louie","Alicia M Navetta","Robert J Garriock","Takashi Mikawa"],"doi":"10.1242\/dev.110007","first_seen_on":"2014-10-03T17:40:41+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1477-9129"],"journal":"Development (09501991)","last_mentioned_on":1414415017,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25273084?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dev.biologists.org\/content\/141\/21\/4149.abstract","http:\/\/dev.biologists.org\/lookup\/volpage\/141\/4149?iss=21","http:\/\/dev.biologists.org\/content\/141\/21\/4149"],"pmid":"25273084","pubdate":"2014-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"Reciprocal myocardial-endocardial interactions pattern the delay in atrioventricular junction conduction","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reciprocal-myocardialendocardial-interactions-pattern-delay-atrioventricular-junction-conduction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.684,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.684},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":513441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4522696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137796,"mean":8.6084302623465,"rank":19269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":118527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137796,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3351,"mean":5.2569802985075,"rank":424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":2903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3351,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":7.6557272727273,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
