EE is associated with chronic mountain sickness (CMS), or lack of adaptation to HA. Testosterone is an erythropoietic hormone and it may play a role on EE at HA. The objective of the present review was to summarise findings on role of serum T levels on adaptation at HA and genes acting on this process. Men at HA without EE have higher androstenedione levels and low ratio androstenedione\/testosterone than men with EE, suggesting low activity of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD), and this could be a mechanism of adaptation to HA. Higher conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone to testosterone in men with EE suggests nigher 17beta-HSD activity. Men with CMS at Peruvian Central Andes have two genes SENP1, and ANP32D with higher transcriptional response to hypoxia relative to those without. SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) is an erythropoiesis regulator, which is essential for the stability and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1\u03b1) under hypoxia. SENP1 reverses the hormone-augmented SUMOylation of androgen receptor (AR) increasing the transcription activity of AR.In conclusion, increased androgen activity is related with CMS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b2c","authors":["G F Gonzales","D Chaupis"],"doi":"10.1111\/and.12359","first_seen_on":"2014-10-04T18:38:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-0272"],"journal":"International Journal of Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1412447885,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25277225?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25277225","pubdate":"2014-10-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Higher androgen bioactivity is associated with excessive erythrocytosis and chronic mountain sickness in Andean Highlanders: a review.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/higher-androgen-bioactivity-associated-excessive-erythrocytosis-chronic-mountain-sickness-andean-hig"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4327208,"mean":4.9516699231994,"rank":3406423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":125908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4327208,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115907,"mean":7.9354384760065,"rank":90109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115907,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":502,"mean":1.5576566866267,"rank":313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":502,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.4480769230769,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
