Initiation of CME relies on adaptor proteins, which precisely select the cargoes for internalization, recruit the clathrin cage, and start membrane curvature. The recently identified CME early adaptor complex, the TPLATE complex (TPC), is essential for CME in plants. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the TPC evolved from an ancient protein complex involved in vesicle trafficking in early eukaryotes, which raises questions about CME evolution and adaptation within the eukaryotic Kingdoms. In this review, we focus on the early events of plant CME and explore evolutionary aspects related to CME in other eukaryotes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b5","authors":["Yi Zhang","Staffan Persson","Jennifer Hirst","Margaret S Robinson","Daniel van Damme","Clara S\u00e1nchez-Rodr\u00edguez","Zhang Y","Persson S","Hirst J","Robinson MS","van Damme D","S\u00e1nchez-Rodr\u00edguez C","Margaret S.
