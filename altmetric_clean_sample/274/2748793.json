This chapter summarizes the up-to-date knowledge about facts and factors important in the epidemiology of LB all over the world. Individual sections briefly describe geographic (latitudinal and altitudinal) distribution and incidence rates of LB in individual countries; seasonal distribution of the disease; effects of patients' age, sex, and profession; comparison of urban versus rural settings; weather-related effects on LB incidence; risk factors for LB acquisition by humans; and risk assessment. This chapter finishes by recommending a more thorough epidemiological surveillance for LB, including morbidity notification in some additional countries where it has not yet been fully implemented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000707f","authors":["Hub\u00e1lek Z"],"doi":"10.1159\/000213069","first_seen_on":"2014-10-07T09:49:54+00:00","issns":["1421-5721"],"issue":"","journal":"Current Problems in Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1463381662,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19367096","http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/24278231_Epidemiology_of_lyme_borreliosis"],"pmid":"19367096","pubdate":"2009-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Epidemiology of lyme borreliosis.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemiology-lyme-borreliosis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":54.58,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":54.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8040368,"mean":6.8299370028724,"rank":158542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7882044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8040368,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196879,"mean":7.8918460671077,"rank":5267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":191612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196879,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":3.4479166666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
