Twelve children with bilateral spastic CP (3 with gross motor function classification system Level I, 5 with Level II, and 4 with Level III) participated in this study. All participants underwent pediatric reach tests and ball throwing performance analyses while seated on 15\u00b0 anterior- or posterior-inclined, and horizontal surfaces. An electromagnetic motion analysis system was synchronized with a force plate to assess throwing motion and postural stability. The results of the pediatric reach test (p=0.026), the amplitude of elbow movement (p=0.036), peak vertical ground reaction force (PVGRF) (p<0.001), and movement range of the center of pressure (COP) (p<0.020) were significantly affected by seat inclination during throwing. Post hoc comparisons showed that anterior inclination allowed greater amplitude of elbow movement and PVGRF, and less COP movement range compared with the other inclines. Posterior inclination yielded less reaching distance and PVGRF, and greater COP movement range compared with the other inclines. The anterior-inclined seat yielded superior postural stability for throwing Boccia balls among children with bilateral spastic CP, whereas the posterior-inclined seat caused difficulty.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003464","authors":["Tsai YS","Yu YC","Huang PC","Cheng HY"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ridd.2014.08.033","first_seen_on":"2014-10-06T17:10:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"12","journal":"Research in Developmental Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1441845208,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25241116","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25241116?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ridd.2014.08.033"],"pmid":"25241116","pubdate":"2014-09-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Seat surface inclination may affect postural stability during Boccia ball throwing in children with cerebral palsy.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seat-surface-inclination-affect-postural-stability-during-boccia-ball-throwing-children-cerebral-pal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6315239,"mean":5.8222232064737,"rank":2293064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3992934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6315239,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151226,"mean":8.6077333377419,"rank":54916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":95268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151226,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1174,"mean":2.6999335038363,"rank":352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1174,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":6.4289743589744,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
