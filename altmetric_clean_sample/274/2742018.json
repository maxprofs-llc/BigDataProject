The proposed strategy is based on a state space approach originating from the analysis of dynamical systems. The article then focuses on one constituent of consciousness, phenomenal awareness. Several rudimentary requirements for the identification of neural correlates of phenomenal awareness are suggested. These requirements are related to empirical data on selective attention, on completely intrinsic selection and on globally unconscious states. As an example, neuroscientific findings on synchronized gamma activity are categorized according to these requirements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000378d","doi":"10.1016\/j.concog.2004.07.001","first_seen_on":"2014-10-04T14:29:35+00:00","issns":["10538100"],"journal":"Consciousness & Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1412432924,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1053810004000571"],"pmid":"15522628","pubdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Identifying neural correlates of consciousness: The state space approach ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identifying-neural-correlates-consciousness-state-space-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2294623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1620364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119941,"mean":8.2096917625481,"rank":58400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":48672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119941,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":677,"mean":9.9700029585799,"rank":459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":677,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":7.24,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Ph.
