The examination included nine varieties of Sea buckthorn growing in the comparative cultivation. Conducted analysis allowed to compare the antioxidant capacity with carotenoids content measured with spectrophotometric and HPLC methods. Three of the examined cultivars indicating high antioxidant activity in both, FRAP and DPPH methods, also revealed highest ('Aromatnaya') and high ('Botanicheskaya', 'Arumnyj') total carotenoids content in HPLC analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006827","first_seen_on":"2012-03-21T11:38:26+00:00","issns":["1734-154X"],"journal":"Acta Biochimica Polonica","last_mentioned_on":1332328612,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22428129"],"pmid":"22428129","pubdate":"2012-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Antioxidant capacity of crude extracts containing carotenoids from the berries of various cultivars of Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antioxidant-capacity-crude-extracts-containing-carotenoids-berries-various-cultivars-sea-buckthorn-h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2670642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78305,"mean":4.6683488710666,"rank":33991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":32933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78305,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225,"mean":1.4896964285714,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.1090909090909,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
