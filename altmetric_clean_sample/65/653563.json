Piwi's genomic protective function conflicts with reports that its human ortholog, Hiwi, is expressed in numerous cancers and prognosticates shorter survival. However, the role of Hiwi in tumorigenesis has not been examined. Here we demonstrate that (1) over-expressing Hiwi in sarcoma precursors inhibits their differentiation in vitro and generates sarcomas in vivo; (2) transgenic mice expressing Hiwi (mesodermally restricted) develop sarcomas; and (3) inducible down-regulation of Hiwi in human sarcomas inhibits growth and re-establishes differentiation. Our data indicates that Hiwi is directly tumorigenic and Hiwi-expressing cancers may be addicted to Hiwi expression. We further show that Hiwi associated DNA methylation and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) silencing is reversible along with Hiwi-induced tumorigenesis, via DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors. Our studies reveal for the first time not only a novel oncogenic role for Hiwi as a driver of tumorigenesis, but also suggest that the use of epigenetic agents may be clinically beneficial for treatment of tumors that express Hiwi. Additionally, our data showing that Hiwi-associated DNA hyper-methylation with subsequent genetic and epigenetic changes favoring a tumorigenic state reconciles the conundrum of how Hiwi may act appropriately to promote genomic integrity during early development (via transposon silencing) and inappropriately in adult tissues with subsequent tumorigenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E3711S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sara Siddiqi","Melissa Terry","Igor Matushansky"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0033711","first_seen_on":"2012-03-17T14:15:25+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1331933053,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033711?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FPLoSONE+%28PLoS+ONE+Alerts%3A+New+Articles%29"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0033711.pdf","pmid":"22438986","pubdate":"2012-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e33711","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Hiwi Mediated Tumorigenesis Is Associated with DNA Hypermethylation","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hiwi-mediated-tumorigenesis-associated-dna-hypermethylation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":2900705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80278,"mean":3.9203391756044,"rank":57521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80278,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64077,"mean":8.2886282227356,"rank":50253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64077,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2900,"mean":5.4835446705761,"rank":2252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2900,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
