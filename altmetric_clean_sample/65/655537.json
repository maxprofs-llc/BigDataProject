We evaluated histological outcome of intraoperative biopsies at laparoscopic renal mass cryoablation (LCA), prevalence of peritumoral fat tissue invasion, and risk of tract seeding. Methods. Patients were biopsied 3-5 times (16-gauge). Histology was analyzed by general pathologists and reviewed. Peritumoral fat was histologically examined. The trocar used for biopsy-guidance was examined by cytology. Records were studied for reporting tract metastasis. Results. 77 biopsied renal masses with mean \u00b1 SD diameter 30 \u00b1 7.4\u2009mm were histologically classified by primary and review pathology revealing 64 and 62 malignancies, 13 and 15 benign lesions, respectively. In 30\/34, the fat covered a carcinoma but revealed no malignancy. Cytology showed no malignant cells but was inconclusive in 1 case. No tract metastasis occurred. Conclusions. The use of an intraoperative biopsy protocol provides histological diagnosis of all renal masses. No existence of peritumoral fat tissue invasion or tract seeding was found.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5193cf058f610003846","authors":["van der Zee, J.
