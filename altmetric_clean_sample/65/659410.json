Galiximab inhibits tumor cell proliferation through possibly cell signaling-mediated effects. Thus, we hypothesized that galiximab may signal the tumor cells and modify intracellular survival\/antiapoptotic pathways such as the NF-\u03baB pathway. This hypothesis was tested using various CD80(+) Burkitt B-NHL (non-Hodgkin lymphomas) cell lines as models. Treatment of B-NHL cells with galiximab (25-100 \u03bcg\/mL) resulted in significant inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity and its target resistant factors such as YY1, Snail, and Bcl-2\/Bcl-XL. Treatment of B-NHL cells with galiximab sensitized the tumor cells to both cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP)- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The important roles of YY1- and Snail-induced inhibition by galiximab in the sensitization to CCDP and TRAIL were corroborated following transfection of Raji cells with YY1 or Snail short interfering RNA. The transfected cells were shown to become sensitive to both CCDP- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the absence of galiximab. Furthermore, knockdown of YY1 or Snail inhibited Bcl-XL. The involvement of Bcl-XL inhibition in sensitization was corroborated by the use of the pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor 2MAM-3 whereby the treated cells were sensitive to both CDDP- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings show that galiximab inhibits the NF-\u03baB\/Snail\/YY1\/Bcl-XL circuit that regulates drug resistance in B-NHL and in combination with cytotoxic drugs results in apoptosis. The findings also support the therapeutic application of the combination of galiximab and cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of drug-resistant CD80-positive B-cell malignancies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e0","doi":"10.1158\/1535-7163.mct-11-0635","first_seen_on":"2012-03-21T17:14:58+00:00","issns":["1538-8514"],"journal":"Molecular Cancer Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1332349612,"links":["http:\/\/mct.aacrjournals.org\/content\/11\/3\/572.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/mct.aacrjournals.org\/content\/11\/3\/572.full.pdf","pmid":"22267549","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["antineoplasticagents"],"title":"Galiximab Signals B-NHL Cells and Inhibits the Activities of NF-\u03baB\u2013Induced YY1- and Snail-Resistant Factors: Mechanism of Sensitization to Apoptosis by Chemoimmunotherapeutic Drugs","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/galiximab-signals-bnhl-cells-inhibits-activities-nfkbinduced-yy1and-snailresistant-factors-mechanism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506977,"mean":5.1265981649798,"rank":3083894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":968239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506977,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75859,"mean":4.3821943895172,"rank":46932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75859,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":946,"mean":4.6777312169312,"rank":647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":946,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.2821428571429,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
