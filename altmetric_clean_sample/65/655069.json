Improved skin barrier function"],"citation":{"abstract":"Male skin care needs are heavily influenced by the need to remove facial hair on a regular basis. Facial skin issues associated with poor hair removal approaches are common and include razor burn and irritation. This paper evaluates current research on shaving technology and how careful ingredient selection can contribute to male skin health. The importance of maintaining hair softness during the shave and restoring facial hydration post-shave is discussed. Data are presented on how post-shave moisturizers containing glycerine and emollients can create an environment for improved barrier function which can be further improved by incorporating specific ingredients such as niacinamide.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002442","authors":["Draelos ZD"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2133.2011.10784.x","first_seen_on":"2012-03-19T08:00:11+00:00","issns":["0007-0963"],"issue":"","journal":"British Journal of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1336667427,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22385030"],"pmid":"22385030","pubdate":"2012-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Male skin and ingredients relevant to male skin care.","type":"article","volume":"166 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/male-skin-ingredients-relevant-male-skin-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9307173704291,"rank":2904607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73262,"mean":4.0820459453188,"rank":52915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73262,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2188,"mean":3.2368980338363,"rank":1723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2188,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.7472,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
