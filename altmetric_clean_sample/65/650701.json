Recently, increased activity in the subthalamic nucleus has been implicated in the motor abnormalities. To test this hypothesis, the effects of lesions of the subthalamic nucleus were evaluated in monkeys rendered parkinsonian by treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The lesions reduced all of the major motor disturbances in the contralateral limbs, including akinesia, rigidity, and tremor. This result supports the postulated role of excessive activity in the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1990Sci...249.1436B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Bergman, H","Wichmann, T","DeLong, M R","H Bergman","T Wichmann","MR DeLong"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.2402638","endpage":"1438","first_seen_on":"2012-03-15T16:12:33+00:00","issns":["0036-8075","1095-9203"],"issue":"4975","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1410567660,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2402638","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.2402638"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/sci\/249\/4975\/1436.full.pdf","pmid":"2402638","pubdate":"1990-09-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"1436","subjects":["science"],"title":"Reversal of experimental parkinsonism by lesions of the subthalamic nucleus.","type":"article","volume":"249","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reversal-experimental-parkinsonism-lesions-subthalamic-nucleus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.848,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.848},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8003796,"mean":6.7526194189081,"rank":574324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7429391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8003796,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93143,"mean":5.1094599214103,"rank":6023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":87119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93143,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40679,"mean":32.199730173558,"rank":12269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":28410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40679,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":672,"mean":22.088992548435,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":672,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":15,"Researcher":61,"Student  > Doctoral Student":16,"Student  > Ph.
