Complications, such as pain, calcinosis, and lipoatrophy, are associated with high morbidity. While it has been suggested that panniculitis in DM may correlate with a better prognosis, our understanding of its true significance, prognostic implications, and management is limited by the paucity of reported cases. We describe the first reported case to our knowledge of DM-associated panniculitis in the setting of ovarian adenocarcinoma as well as in association with a recurrent malignancy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006af6","doi":"10.1001\/archdermatol.2012.288","first_seen_on":"2012-03-20T12:56:17+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Archives of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1391468408,"links":["http:\/\/archderm.ama-assn.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/archdermatol.2012.288v1?rss=1","http:\/\/archderm.jamanetwork.com\/article.aspx?articleid=1149926"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/archderm.ama-assn.org\/cgi\/reprint\/archdermatol.2012.288v1.pdf","pmid":"22431715","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JAMA","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Panniculitis Associated With Dermatomyositis and Recurrent Ovarian Cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/panniculitis-associated-dermatomyositis-recurrent-ovarian-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2910425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1444583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75885,"mean":4.4460168151388,"rank":43543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":29137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75885,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1020,"mean":3.1633523061825,"rank":793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1020,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":5.9390909090909,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
