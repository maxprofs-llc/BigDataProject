In individual cases, certain irregular ground conditions elicited large increases in peak flexion moments (>50%) when compared to walking on smooth level ground. Forces and moments were significantly higher at faster walking speeds.\nHigher external peak knee flexion moments during the stance phase suggest that greater demands for support and stability are placed on individuals and their assistive devices when negotiating real-life ground surfaces. Clinical relevance This study demonstrates that walking on irregular surfaces alters the loads placed on knee-ankle-foot orthoses and that the requirements for knee stabilization increase. This has important clinical implications on the design, prescription, and use of such devices given the structural and functional demands placed on them.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008644","authors":["Jan Andrysek","Susan Klejman","John Kooy"],"doi":"10.1177\/0309364613489145","endpage":"113","first_seen_on":"2013-05-31T13:02:34+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1746-1553"],"issue":"2","journal":"Prosthetics and Orthotics International","last_mentioned_on":1400938293,"links":["http:\/\/poi.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/05\/30\/0309364613489145.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/poi.sagepub.com\/content\/38\/2\/104.abstract","http:\/\/poi.sagepub.com\/content\/38\/2\/104.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/poi.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/05\/30\/0309364613489145.full.pdf","pmid":"23722598","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"104","subjects":["orthopedics","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Forces and moments in knee\u2013ankle\u2013foot orthoses while walking on irregular surfaces: A case series study","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/forces-moments-kneeanklefoot-orthoses-while-walking-irregular-surfaces-case-series-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4504824,"mean":5.0923717479595,"rank":2368190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1438871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4504824,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89864,"mean":7.1013177837375,"rank":46919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":26638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89864,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":1.4166666666667,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.8,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
