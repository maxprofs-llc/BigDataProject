We asked participants to complete an ad hoc questionnaire and analysed their answers. Sixty-two per cent of the patients understood the purpose and nature of the trial they were participating in; 44% understood the study procedures and 40% correctly listed at least one of the major risks or complications related to their participation in the trial. We identified three factors associated with comprehension of the informed consent: age, education and type of tumour\/investigator team. We suggest several possible improvements of how to obtain informed consent that will increase patient awareness, as well as the validity and effectiveness of the clinical trials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e41","authors":["Virginia Sanchini","Michele Reni","Giliola Calori","Elisabetta Riva","Massimo Reichlin"],"doi":"10.1136\/medethics-2012-101115","first_seen_on":"2013-05-31T19:10:15+00:00","issns":["1473-4257"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1395556058,"links":["http:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2013\/05\/30\/medethics-2012-101115.short?rss=1","http:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/40\/4\/269.short?rss=1","http:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/40\/4\/269?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2013\/05\/30\/medethics-2012-101115.full.pdf","pmid":"23728419","pubdate":"2013-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Institute of Medical Ethics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Informed consent as an ethical requirement in clinical trials: an old, but still unresolved issue.
