To better understand the genetic etiology of osteosarcoma, we performed a multistage genome-wide association study consisting of 941 individuals with osteosarcoma (cases) and 3,291 cancer-free adult controls of European ancestry. Two loci achieved genome-wide significance: a locus in the GRM4 gene at 6p21.3 (encoding glutamate receptor metabotropic 4; rs1906953; P = 8.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079) and a locus in the gene desert at 2p25.2 (rs7591996 and rs10208273; P = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2078 and 2.9 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077, respectively). These two loci warrant further exploration to uncover the biological mechanisms underlying susceptibility to osteosarcoma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003164","authors":["Sharon A Savage","Lisa Mirabello","Zhaoming Wang","Julie M Gastier-Foster","Richard Gorlick","Chand Khanna","Adrienne M Flanagan","Roberto Tirabosco","Irene L Andrulis","Jay S Wunder","Nalan Gokgoz","Ana Pati\u00c3\u00b1o-Garcia","Luis Sierrases\u00c3\u00bamaga","Fernando Lecanda","Nilg\u00c3\u00bcn Kurucu","Inci Ergurhan Ilhan","Neriman Sari","Massimo Serra","Claudia Hattinger","Piero Picci","Logan G Spector","Donald A Barkauskas","Neyssa Marina","Silvia Regina Caminada de Toledo","Antonio S Petrilli","Maria Fernanda Amary","Dina Halai","David M Thomas","Chester Douglass","Paul S Meltzer","Kevin Jacobs","Charles C Chung","Sonja I Berndt","Mark P Purdue","Neil E Caporaso","Margaret Tucker","Nathaniel Rothman","Maria Teresa Landi","Debra T Silverman","Peter Kraft","David J Hunter","Nuria Malats","Manolis Kogevinas","Sholom Wacholder","Rebecca Troisi","Lee Helman","Joseph F Fraumeni Jr","Meredith Yeager","Robert N Hoover","Stephen J Chanock","Savage SA","Mirabello L","Wang Z","Gastier-Foster JM","Gorlick R","Khanna C","Flanagan AM","Tirabosco R","Andrulis IL","Wunder JS","Gokgoz N","Pati\u00f1o-Garcia A","Sierrases\u00famaga L","Lecanda F","Kurucu N","Ilhan IE","Sari N","Serra M","Hattinger C","Picci P","Spector LG","Barkauskas DA","Marina N","de Toledo SR","Petrilli AS","Amary MF","Halai D","Thomas DM","Douglass C","Meltzer PS","Jacobs K","Chung CC","Berndt SI","Purdue MP","Caporaso NE","Tucker M","Rothman N","Landi MT","Silverman DT","Kraft P","Hunter DJ","Malats N","Kogevinas M","Wacholder S","Troisi R","Helman L","Fraumeni JF Jr","Yeager M","Hoover RN","Chanock SJ","Ana Pati\u00f1o-Garcia","Luis Sierrases\u00famaga","Nilg\u00fcn Kurucu","Joseph F Fraumeni"],"doi":"10.1038\/ng.2645","endpage":"803","first_seen_on":"2013-06-03T16:40:03+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1061-4036","1546-1718"],"issue":"7","journal":"Nature Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1388361600,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ng\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/ng.2645.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ng.2645","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ng\/journal\/v45\/n7\/full\/ng.2645.html"],"pmid":"23727862","pubdate":"2013-06-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"799","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Genome-wide association study identifies two susceptibility loci for osteosarcoma","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ng.2645","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-association-study-identifies-two-susceptibility-loci-osteosarcoma-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":21.37,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":21.37},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508238,"mean":5.1674528195662,"rank":167439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":4340881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508238,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89717,"mean":7.3171599937582,"rank":5425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":84292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89717,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4016,"mean":14.523460523039,"rank":592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4016,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":39.567558823529,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
