The aim of this study was to determine whether prolonged whole-body mild hypothermia inhibits mitochondrial membrane permeability (MMP) in the cerebral cortex after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Thirty-seven inbred Chinese Wuzhishan minipigs were successfully resuscitated after 8\u2009minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation (VF) and underwent recovery under normothermic (NT) or prolonged whole-body mild hypothermic (HT; 33\u00b0C) conditions for 24 or 72\u2009hours. Cerebral samples from the frontal cortex were collected at 24 and 72\u2009hours after ROSC. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation. At 24\u2009hours, relative to NT, HT was associated with reductions in opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, release of pro-apoptotic substances from mitochondria, caspase 3 cleavage, apoptosis, and neurologic deficit scores, as well as increases in mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial respiration. Together, these findings suggest that mild hypothermia inhibits ischemia-induced increases in MMP, which may provide neuroprotection against cerebral injury after cardiac arrest.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce7","authors":["Ping Gong","Rong Hua","Yu Zhang","Hong Zhao","Ziren Tang","Xue Mei","Mingyue Zhang","Juan Cui","Chunsheng Li"],"doi":"10.1038\/jcbfm.2013.33","endpage":"934","first_seen_on":"2013-06-03T11:13:15+00:00","issns":["0271-678X","1559-7016"],"journal":"Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1370257992,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/jcbfm\/journal\/v33\/n6\/full\/jcbfm201333a.html"],"pmid":"23486294","pubdate":"2013-03-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"928","subjects":["metabolism","brain"],"title":"Hypothermia-induced neuroprotection is associated with reduced mitochondrial membrane permeability in a swine model of cardiac arrest","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypothermiainduced-neuroprotection-associated-reduced-mitochondrial-membrane-permeability-swine-mode"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":2900802,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85500,"mean":7.0652252073125,"rank":67549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85500,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":704,"mean":3.8676614509246,"rank":499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":704,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.5965517241379,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"EG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yassermetwally\/statuses\/341512889816993792","license":"public","citation_ids":[1527972],"posted_on":"2013-06-03T11:13:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Professor Yasser","url":"http:\/\/yassermetwally.com","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1233555507\/avatar_normal.jpg","description":"Professor of neurology","id_on_source":"yassermetwally","tweeter_id":"18056466","geo":{"lt":"30.0488185","ln":"31.2436663","country":"EG"},"followers":59},"tweet_id":"341512889816993792"}]}}
