As an alternative, this paper promotes a public health prevention model and maps out opportunities for intervention at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. The resulting model is partly derived from generic research into these issues and partly on specific evidence on interventions for people with intellectual disabilities; it also contains more theoretical considerations. The additional research that is necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the interventions identified is also considered. Central to this proposal is a greater integration of issues for people with intellectual disabilities within much broader policy and research agendas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002c9c","authors":["Allen, David","Langthorne, Paul","Tonge, Bruce","Emerson, Eric","McGill, Peter","Fletcher, Robert","Dosen, Anton","Kennedy, Craig","Allen D","Langthorne P","Tonge B","Emerson E","McGill P","Fletcher R","Dosen A","Kennedy C"],"doi":"10.1111\/jar.12050","endpage":"514","first_seen_on":"2013-06-01T07:14:17+00:00","issns":["1468-3148","1360-2322"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1446163666,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jar.12050\/abstract;jsessionid=1CDDC5D213D86DE07146E2754E850B5C.d03t03?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jar.12050\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1111\/jar.12050\/;jsessionid=B7BE259FCB68DA04AE5AB7B600A57390.f02t03?regionCode=reserved-reserved&identityKey=aa118453-3b3e-413d-a9c7-da09f528a234&isReportingDone=true","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jar.12050"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jar.12050\/pdf","pmid":"23712642","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"501","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Towards the Prevention of Behavioural and Psychiatric Disorders in People with Intellectual Disabilities.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/towards-prevention-behavioural-psychiatric-disorders-people-intellectual-disabilities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7815745,"mean":6.6314955459077,"rank":1351870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6458776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7815745,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121869,"mean":6.761730068599,"rank":21625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":100121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121869,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":421,"mean":4.2695047619048,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":421,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
