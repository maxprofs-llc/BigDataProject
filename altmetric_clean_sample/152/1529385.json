Given this population's rapid growth, documenting the influence of alcohol use on recent Latino immigrants' (RLI) sexual risk behaviors is essential. Data prior to immigration were retrospectively collected from 527 RLI ages 18-39 years. Quantity and frequency of alcohol use during the 90 days prior to immigration and pre-immigration sexual risk behaviors were measured. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships. Males, single participants, and participants with higher incomes reported more alcohol use. Higher alcohol use was associated with lower condom use frequency, having sex under the influence, and more sexual partners among all participants. Results point to the importance of creating interventions targeting adult RLI men, given their likelihood to engage in alcohol consumption, sex under the influence of alcohol, and sex with multiple partners without using condoms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5a63cf058f61000530f","authors":["Rojas P","Dillon FR","Cyrus E","Ravelo GJ","Malow RM","De La Rosa M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jana.2013.02.003","first_seen_on":"2013-06-04T00:35:34+00:00","issns":["1055-3290"],"issue":"","journal":"JANAC: Journal of the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care","last_mentioned_on":1400001695,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23706771","http:\/\/www.nursesinaidscarejournal.org\/article\/S1055-3290(13)00040-X\/abstract"],"pmid":"23706771","pubdate":"2013-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Alcohol Use as a Determinant of HIV Risk Behaviors Among Recent Latino Immigrants in\u00a0South Florida.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alcohol-determinant-hiv-risk-behaviors-among-recent-latino-immigrants-south-florida"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":941928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3559885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89512,"mean":7.2742005787,"rank":22557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":66787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89512,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":2.3347121212121,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.8166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":8,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":5,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Social Sciences":3,"Psychology":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":6}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LGBTjournal\/status\/465790596817633280","license":"datasift","rt":["HIV_Insight"],"citation_ids":[1529385],"posted_on":"2014-05-12T09:48:26+00:00","author":{"name":"LGBT Journal","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/433542126891048960\/3_q6T9pX_normal.png","description":"The world's most comprehensive #LGBT news feed. #lgbtq #lgbtqi #lesbian #gay #bisexual #transexual #queer #intersex #love #equality #noh8 #hiv #aids","id_on_source":"LGBTjournal","tweeter_id":"1640393216","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1440},"tweet_id":"465790596817633280"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/stigmaactionnet\/status\/466267020565422080","license":"datasift","rt":["HIV_Insight"],"citation_ids":[1529385],"posted_on":"2014-05-13T17:21:35+00:00","author":{"name":"StigmaActionNetwork","url":"http:\/\/www.stigmaactionnetwork.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2088173160\/SAN_Logo_Ribbon_normal.jpg","description":"Working for a world free of HIV-related stigma and discrimination.
