Limited event-specific data have been reported in Black MSM to help understand factors associated with increased risk of infection. Cross-sectional National HIV Behavioral Surveillance Study data from 503 MSM who reported > or =1 male sexual partner in the past year in New York City (NYC) were analyzed. Case-crossover analysis compared last protected and last unprotected anal intercourse (UAI). A total of 503 MSM were enrolled. Among 349 tested for HIV, 18% were positive. Black MSM (N = 117) were more likely to test HIV positive and not know their HIV-positive status than other racial\/ethnic groups. Case-crossover analysis of 208 MSM found that men were more likely to engage in protected anal intercourse with a first time partner and with a partner of unknown HIV status. Although Black MSM were more likely to have Black male partners, they were not more likely to have UAI with those partners or to have a partner aged >40 years. In conclusion, HIV prevalence was high among Black MSM in NYC, as was lack of awareness of HIV-positive status. Having a sexual partner of same race\/ethnicity or older age was not associated with having UAI among Black MSM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f88","authors":["Tieu HV","Murrill C","Xu G","Koblin BA"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11524-009-9416-x","first_seen_on":"2013-06-03T14:34:09+00:00","issns":["1099-3460"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Urban Health","last_mentioned_on":1370270026,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19949990"],"pmcid":"PMC2821613","pmid":"19949990","pubdate":"2009-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health\/Gesundheitswesen","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Sexual partnering and HIV risk among black men who have sex with men: New York City.","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexual-partnering-hiv-risk-among-black-men-sex-men-new-york-city-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628118,"mean":4.9440792284301,"rank":2017647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628118,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85441,"mean":7.0799970739702,"rank":44742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":24178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85441,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":373,"mean":4.8028870967742,"rank":244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":373,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":6.5444444444444,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/The_CBGMC\/statuses\/341563363962265600","license":"public","citation_ids":[1528372],"posted_on":"2013-06-03T14:33:46+00:00","author":{"name":"The CBGMC","url":"http:\/\/chiblackgaycaucus.org","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000624817631\/fbefe38bb97df5cb61ec8334ac982b1c_normal.jpeg","description":"Chicago Black Gay Men's Caucus","id_on_source":"The_CBGMC","tweeter_id":"263221567","geo":{"lt":"41.8756208","ln":"-87.6243706","_id":"Chicago, IL","country":"US"},"followers":571},"tweet_id":"341563363962265600"}]}}
