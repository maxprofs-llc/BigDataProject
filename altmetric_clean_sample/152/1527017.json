It has a major psychosocial impact on a patient's life. Objective: This study aims to investigate the impact of pulsed dye laser on the quality of life of affected patients as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index. Methods: The authors report a prospective study of 20 patients (in a wide range of skin phototypes) attending a laser clinic. All patients completed the Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaires before and after three sessions of laser treatment. Results: The mean Dermatology Life Quality Index scores pre- and post-laser treatment were 17.3 and 4.3, respectively. All patients experienced a statistically significant improvement in their quality of life (p<0.0001, paired t test). Conclusion: The Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire (pre- and post-laser treatment) is an important tool for monitoring the efficacy of therapy and patient satisfaction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f9c","authors":["Tang Ngee Shim","Anthony Abdullah"],"first_seen_on":"2013-06-02T21:14:46+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Clinical & Aesthetic Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1370207682,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3638853\/"],"pmid":"23630639","pubdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Matrix Medical Communications","startpage":"30","title":"The Effect of Pulsed Dye Laser on the Dermatology Life Quality Index in Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea Patients: An Assessment","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-pulsed-dye-laser-dermatology-life-quality-index-erythematotelangiectatic-rosacea-patients-ass"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3081278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":962614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89776,"mean":7.2208246616543,"rank":62023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89776,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180,"mean":3.6994189944134,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.3928571428571,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
