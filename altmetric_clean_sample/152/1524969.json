There is emerging evidence that alterations in RNA metabolism may be critical in the pathogenesis of ALS. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are key determinants of mRNA stability. Considering that miRNAs are increasingly being recognized as having a role in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, we decided to characterize the miRNA expression profile in spinal cord (SC) tissue in sporadic ALS (sALS) and controls. Furthermore, we performed functional analysis to identify a group of dysregulated miRNAs that could be responsible for the selective suppression of low molecular weight neurofilament (NFL) mRNA observed in ALS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000872","authors":["Campos-Melo D","Droppelmann CA","He Z","Volkening K","Strong MJ","Danae Campos-Melo","Cristian A Droppelmann","Zhongping He","Kathryn Volkening","Michael J Strong"],"doi":"10.1186\/1756-6606-6-26","first_seen_on":"2013-06-01T04:43:05+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1756-6606",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Brain","last_mentioned_on":1444345849,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23705811","http:\/\/www.molecularbrain.com\/content\/6\/1\/26"],"pmid":"23705811","pubdate":"2013-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Molecular Brain","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"26","subjects":["molecularbiology","brain"],"title":"Altered microRNA expression profile in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a role in the regulation of NFL mRNA levels","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1756-6606-6-26","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/altered-microrna-expression-profile-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-role-regulation-nfl-mrna-levels"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6242477,"mean":5.954775790249,"rank":2555629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3549641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6242477,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99377,"mean":7.3286617090646,"rank":41410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":54849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99377,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":386,"mean":3.7329298701299,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":386,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.2666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
