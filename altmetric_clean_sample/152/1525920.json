X-ray diffraction analyses reveal 3D architectures that combine helical 1D channels and a fairly rare (6,3) connectivity described with the (4(2).8)\u00b7(4(4).6(2).8(5).10(4)) Sch\u00e4fli symbol. Such 3D architectures make these polymers porous solids upon departure of the non-coordinated guest-solvent molecules as confirmed by the XRD structure of the guest-free [Tb(PTMTC)(EtOH)(2)H(2)O] and [Tb(\u03b1H-PTMTC)(EtOH)(2)H(2)O] materials. Accessible voids represent 40% of the cell volume. Metal-centered luminescence was observed in Tb(III) and Eu(III) coordination polymers 1' and 3', although the Ln(III)-ion luminescence was quenched when radical ligands were involved. The magnetic properties of all these compounds were investigated, and the nature of the {Ln-radical} (in 1 and 2) and the {radical-radical} exchange interactions (in 3) were assessed by comparing the behaviors for the radical-based coordination polymers 1-3 with those of the compounds with the diamagnetic ligand set. Whilst antiferromagnetic {radical-radical} interactions were found in 3, ferromagnetic {Ln-radical} interactions propagated in the 3D architectures of 1 and 2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Datcu, Angela","Roques, Nans","Jubera, V\u00e9ronique","Maspoch, Daniel","Fontrodona, Xavier","Wurst, Klaus","Imaz, Inhar","Mouchaham, Georges","Sutter, Jean\u2010Pascal","Rovira, Concepci\u00f3","Veciana, Jaume"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201102278","endpage":"162","first_seen_on":"2013-06-01T19:05:20+00:00","issns":["1521-3765","0947-6539"],"issue":"1","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1352206550,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201102278\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201102278\/pdf","pmid":"22162101","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"152","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Three\u00e2\u0080\u0090Dimensional Porous Metal\u00e2\u0080\u0093Radical Frameworks Based on Triphenylmethyl Radicals","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threedimensional-porous-metalradical-frameworks-based-triphenylmethyl-radicals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6378189,"mean":5.9866683057946,"rank":5432986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6378189,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100861,"mean":7.2804668649614,"rank":83167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100861,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2919,"mean":3.6136360520905,"rank":1986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2919,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":6.8829756097561,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
