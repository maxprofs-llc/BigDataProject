Previous research on acetic acid-induced modification of proteins has focused on peptide proteolysis by relatively high concentrations of acetic acid (>1.5 mol L(-1)) rather than on the accompanying effect of deamidation. Therefore the objective of this study was to determine the deamidation effect of acetic acid with as little peptide proteolysis as possible by employing low-concentration acetic acid (<0.05 mol L(-1)) to deamidate wheat gluten. Changes in surface hydrophobicity, conformation, functional properties and nutritional characteristics of acetic acid-modified samples were determined and compared with those of hydrochloric acid (HCl)-modified samples.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ee9","authors":["Liao L","Zhao M","Ren J","Zhao H","Cui C","Hu X"],"doi":"10.1002\/jsfa.3830","first_seen_on":"2013-06-02T13:15:43+00:00","issns":["0022-5142"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture","last_mentioned_on":1427580874,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20355061"],"pmid":"20355061","pubdate":"2010-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Effect of acetic acid deamidation-induced modification on functional and nutritional properties and conformation of wheat gluten.","type":"article","volume":"90","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-acetic-acid-deamidationinduced-modification-functional-nutritional-properties-conformation-wh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4929656,"mean":5.8504063963935,"rank":2037774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2808853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4929656,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93129,"mean":7.3576596297569,"rank":33486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":57744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93129,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":903,"mean":2.5774190687361,"rank":289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":903,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.8935238095238,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
