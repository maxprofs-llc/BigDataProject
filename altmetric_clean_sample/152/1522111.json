Recent reports have shown curcumin to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties as well as affecting the 5'-AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), mTOR and STAT-3 signaling pathways. We provide evidence that curcumin acts as an uncoupler. Well-established biochemical techniques were performed on isolated rat liver mitochondria in measuring oxygen consumption, F(0)F(1)-ATPase activity and ATP biosynthesis. Curcumin displays all the characteristics typical of classical uncouplers like fccP and 2,4-dinitrophenol. In addition, at concentrations higher than 50 microM, curcumin was found to inhibit mitochondrial respiration which is a characteristic feature of inhibitory uncouplers. As a protonophoric uncoupler and as an activator of F(0)F(1)-ATPase, curcumin causes a decrease in ATP biosynthesis in rat liver mitochondria. The resulting change in ATP:AMP could disrupt the phosphorylation status of the cell; this provides a possible mechanism for its activation of AMPK and its downstream mTOR and STAT-3 signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Lim HW","Lim HY","Wong KP","Han Wern Lim","Hwee Ying Lim","Kim Ping Wong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2009.08.121","first_seen_on":"2013-05-31T03:04:31+00:00","issns":["0006-291X","0006291X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1369969467,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19715674","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbrc.2009.08.121"],"pmid":"19715674","pubdate":"2009-09-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by curcumin: implication of its cellular mechanism of action.","type":"article","volume":"389","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uncoupling-oxidative-phosphorylation-curcumin-implication-cellular-mechanism-action"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629407,"mean":4.9349111287126,"rank":2901129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629407,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85648,"mean":6.9770491902812,"rank":67658,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85648,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6518,"mean":2.5113064293387,"rank":5454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6518,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":1.6171935483871,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
