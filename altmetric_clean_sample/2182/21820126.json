The Disease Activity Score (DAS) and the DAS28 have been developed to measure disease activity in RA both in daily clinical practice as well as in clinical trials on a group as well as individual level. The DAS\/DAS28 is a continuous measure of RA disease activity that combines information from swollen joints, tender joints, acute phase response and general health. The DAS-based EULAR response criteria were primarily developed to be used in clinical trials. The EULAR response criteria classify individual patients as non-, moderate, or good responders, dependent on the magnitude of change and level of disease activity reached. In addition, already in the early nineties, cut points were developed to categorise patients in remission. The DAS28 is incorporated in several electronic patient records and web-based systems for monitoring purposes in daily clinical practice. In addition to this, it is being used in combination with patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to facilitate self-monitoring.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ef6","authors":["van Riel, Piet L C M","Renskers, Lisanne"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-12T22:37:28+00:00","issns":["0392-856X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1499949153,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27762189","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27762189?log$=activity"],"pmid":"27762189","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"The Disease Activity Score (DAS) and the Disease Activity Score using 28 joint counts (DAS28) in the management of rheumatoid arthritis.","type":"article","volume":"34 Suppl 101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-disease-activity-score-das-disease-activity-score-using-28-joint-counts-das28"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204513,"mean":6.9458687178401,"rank":7099888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204513,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180013,"mean":11.434048774526,"rank":146800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180013,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":649,"mean":2.3791018518519,"rank":498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":649,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.725,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
