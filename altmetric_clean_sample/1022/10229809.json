Real samples of food products consumed by students at home (students as samplers) were employed as teaching material in three different courses of Genetics during the academic year 2014-2015: Experimental Methods in Food Production (MBTA) (Master level), and Applied Molecular Biology (BMA) and Conservation Genetics and Breeding (COMGE) (Bachelor\/Degree level). Molecular genetics based on PCR amplification of DNA markers was employed for species identification of 22 seafood products in COMGE and MBTA, and for detection of genetically modified (GM) maize from nine products in BMA. In total six seafood products incorrectly labeled (27%), and two undeclared GM maize (22%) were found. A post-Laboratory survey was applied for assessing the efficacy of the approach for improving motivation in the Laboratory Practices of Genetics. Results confirmed that students that worked on their own samples from local markets were significantly more motivated and better evaluated their Genetic laboratory practices than control students (\u03c7(2) \u2009=\u200912.11 p\u2009=\u20090.033). Our results suggest that citizen science approaches could not be only useful for improving teaching of Genetics in universities but also to incorporate students and citizens as active agents in food control. \u00a9 2016 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2016.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fe3cf058f61000611e","authors":["Borrell, Y J","Mu\u00f1oz-Colmenero, A M","Dopico, E","Miralles, L","Garcia-Vazquez, E","Borrell, Y.J.","Mu\u00f1oz\u2010Colmenero, A.M.","Dopico, E.","Miralles, L.","Garcia\u2010Vazquez, E."],"doi":"10.1002\/bmb.20971","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T01:05:23+00:00","issns":["1539-3429","14708175"],"journal":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology Education","last_mentioned_on":1489229356,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27277420","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/bmb.20971"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bmb.20971\/pdf","pmid":"27277420","pubdate":"2016-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","education","biochemistry"],"title":"Food control and a citizen science approach for improving teaching of Genetics in universities","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/bmb.20971","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/food-control-citizen-science-approach-improving-teaching-genetics-universities-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":6032795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2011713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259713,"mean":12.002704203117,"rank":167434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":76758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259713,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":340,"mean":2.8241474926254,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":340,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.1214285714286,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":3},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"JP":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NorgenScience\/statuses\/760642607655493633","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10229809],"posted_on":"2016-08-03T01:05:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Norgen Science","url":"http:\/\/www.norgenbiotek.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/461238298627694592\/SaoXMVHZ_normal.jpeg","description":"Norgen Biotek Corp. publications, research, news, and more.
