The Office-Guidelines Applied to Practice (Office-GAP) intervention is an application of a previous model revised to address guidelines based care for low-income populations with diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD).\nTo evaluate Office-GAP Program feasibility and preliminary efficacy on medication use, patient satisfaction with physician communication and confidence in decision in low-income population with diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) in a Federally Qualified Healthcare Center (FQHC).\nNinety-five patients participated in an Office-GAP program. A quasi-experimental design study, over 6\u00a0months with 12-month follow-up. Office-GAP program integrates health literacy, communication skills education for patients and physicians, patient\/physician decision support tools and SDM into routine care.\n1) Implementation rates of planned program elements 2) Patient satisfaction with communication and confidence in decision, and 3) Medication prescription rates. We used the GEE method for hierarchical logistic models, controlling for confounding.\nFeasibility of the Office-GAP program in the FQHC setting was established. We found significant increase in use of Aspirin\/Plavix, statin and beta-blocker during follow-up compared to baseline: Aspirin OR 1.5 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.1, 2.2) at 3-months, 1.9 (1.3, 2.9) at 6-months, and 1.8 (1.2, 2.8) at 12-months. Statin OR 1.1 (1.0, 1.3) at 3-months and 1.5 (1.1, 2.2) at 12-months; beta-blocker 1.8 (1.1, 2.9) at 6-months and 12-months. Program elements were consistently used (\u2265 98\u00a0% clinic attendance at training and tool used). Patient satisfaction with communication and confidence in decision increased.\nThe use of Office-GAP program to teach SDM and use of DAs in real time was demonstrated to be feasible in FQHCs. It has the potential to improve satisfaction with physician communication and confidence in decisions and to improve medication use. The Office-GAP program is a brief, efficient platform for delivering patient and provider education in SDM and could serve as a model for implementing guideline based care for all chronic diseases in outpatient clinical settings. Further evaluation is needed to establish feasibility outside clinical study, reach, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this approach.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bb","authors":["Adesuwa Olomu","William Hart-Davidson","Zhehui Luo","Karen Kelly-Blake","Margaret Holmes-Rovner","Olomu, Adesuwa","Hart-Davidson, William","Luo, Zhehui","Kelly-Blake, Karen","Holmes-Rovner, Margaret"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12913-016-1603-3","first_seen_on":"2016-08-03T00:38:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6963"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Health Services Research","last_mentioned_on":1501678965,"links":["http:\/\/bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12913-016-1603-3","https:\/\/bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12913-016-1603-3","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4970246\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27484348\/","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/epdf\/10.1186\/s12913-016-1603-3?author_access_token=f5R7FdnQdYrUYTLiq4rpX2_BpE1tBhCbnbw3BuzI2RPQG1pPCxxvYr0NAplMxB1cSfWpxFhf_g1JCmWdQNlvD5_GnFJxb_daER4CkERwjjzRD-6pm9UmT3XTVlI7xuBza06taTx7R3IYJ1t-l15y6A%3D%3D"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12913-016-1603-3?site=bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4970246","pmid":"27484348","pubdate":"2016-08-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Implementing shared decision making in federally qualified health centers, a quasi-experimental design study: the Office-Guidelines Applied to Practice (Office-GAP) program","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implementing-shared-decision-making-federally-qualified-health-centers-quasiexperimental-design-stud"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.458,"score_history":{"1y":8.508,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.458},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":748974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7565145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259496,"mean":11.999835842694,"rank":34237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":225258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259496,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3096,"mean":5.5174778675283,"rank":316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":2780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3096,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":6.8467319587629,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
