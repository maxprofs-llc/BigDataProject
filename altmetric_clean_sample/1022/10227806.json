We explored the potential of using peripheral blood (PB) cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform.\nWe performed NGS on a panel of 14 target genes using total nucleic acid extracted from the plasma of 16 patients, all of whom had confirmed diagnoses for early MDS with blasts <5%. PB cellular DNA from the same patients was sequenced using conventional Sanger sequencing and NGS.\nDeep sequencing of the cf-DNA exhibited one or more mutated gene(s), confirming the diagnosis of MDS in all cases. Five samples (31%) showed abnormalities in cf-DNA by NGS that were not detected by Sanger sequencing on cellular PB DNA. NGS of PB cell DNA showed the same findings as those of cf-DNA in four of five patients, but failed to show a mutation in the RUNX1 gene that was detected in one patient's cf-DNA. Mutant allele frequency was significantly higher in cf-DNA compared with cellular DNA (p\u2009=\u20090.008).\nThese data suggest that cf-DNA when analyzed using NGS is a reliable approach for detecting molecular abnormalities in MDS and should be used to determine if bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are necessary.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002941","authors":["AlbitarFerras"],"doi":"10.1089\/gtmb.2015.0278","endpage":"345","first_seen_on":"2016-08-02T23:46:50+00:00","issns":["1945-0257","1945-0265"],"issue":"7","journal":"Genetic Testing","last_mentioned_on":1470658212,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/gtmb.2015.0278","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/10.1089\/gtmb.2015.0278","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/gtmb.2015.0278"],"pmid":"27248906","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"341","subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Deep Sequencing of Cell-Free Peripheral Blood DNA as a Reliable Method for Confirming the Diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndrome","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deep-sequencing-cellfree-peripheral-blood-dna-reliable-method-confirming-diagnosis-myelodysplastic-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":64.038,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":64.038},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":138233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8044908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257963,"mean":12.006377055535,"rank":9238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":248725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257963,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":328,"mean":4.6648501529052,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":328,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":28.878666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CH":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Study shows cell-free DNA sequencing is more accurate for diagnosing myelodysplastic syndrome","url":"http:\/\/feeds.biologynews.net\/~r\/biologynews\/headlines\/~3\/ShvnL6DS7ok\/study_shows_cellfree_dna_sequencing_is_more_accurate_for_diagnosing_myelodysplastic_syndrome.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[10227806],"posted_on":"2016-08-02T22:08:00+00:00","summary":"Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods to analyze cell-free DNA in the blood of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) yields more accurate results than the current standard approach of Sanger sequencing.
