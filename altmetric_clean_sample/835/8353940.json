Moreover, these cultivars present advantages of convenient cultivation, management, and so on. We obtained a dwarf mutant '8818-1' through EMS (ethyl methane sulphonate) mutagenesis of Williams banana 8818 (Musa spp. AAA group). Our research have shown that gibberellins (GAs) content in 8818-1 false stems was significantly lower than that in its parent 8818 and the dwarf type of 8818-1 could be restored by application of exogenous GA3. Although GA exerts important impacts on the 8818-1 dwarf type, our understanding of the regulation of GA metabolism during banana dwarf mutant development remains limited.\nGenome-wide screening revealed 36 candidate GA metabolism genes were systematically identified for the first time; these genes included 3 MaCPS, 2 MaKS, 1 MaKO, 2 MaKAO, 10 MaGA20ox, 4 MaGA3ox, and 14 MaGA2ox genes. Phylogenetic tree and conserved protein domain analyses showed sequence conservation and divergence. GA metabolism genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns. Early GA biosynthesis genes were constitutively expressed but presented differential regulation in different tissues in Williams banana. GA oxidase family genes were mainly transcribed in young fruits, thus suggesting that young fruits were the most active tissue involved in GA metabolism, followed by leaves, bracts, and finally approximately mature fruits. Expression patterns between 8818 and 8818-1 revealed that MaGA20ox4, MaGA20ox5, and MaGA20ox7 of the MaGA20ox gene family and MaGA2ox7, MaGA2ox12, and MaGA2ox14 of the MaGA2ox gene family exhibited significant differential expression and high-expression levels in false stems. These genes are likely to be responsible for the regulation of GAs content in 8818-1 false stems.\nOverall, phylogenetic evolution, tissue specificity and differential expression analyses of GA metabolism genes can provide a better understanding of GA-regulated development in banana. The present results revealed that MaGA20ox4, MaGA20ox5, MaGA20ox7, MaGA2ox7, MaGA2ox12, and MaGA2ox14 were the main genes regulating GA content difference between 8818 and 8818-1. All of these genes may perform important functions in the developmental processes of banana, but each gene may perform different functions in different tissues or during different developmental stages.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d4","authors":["Chen, Jingjing","Xie, Jianghui","Duan, Yajie","Hu, Huigang","Hu, Yulin","Li, Weiming","Jingjing Chen","Jianghui Xie","Yajie Duan","Huigang Hu","Yulin Hu","Weiming Li"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12870-016-0809-1","first_seen_on":"2016-05-29T11:01:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2229"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Plant Biology","last_mentioned_on":1464887110,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27234596?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12870-016-0809-1?platform=hootsuite"],"pmcid":"PMC4884393","pmid":"27234596","pubdate":"2016-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agriculture","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tree Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Genome-wide identification and expression profiling reveal tissue-specific expression and differentially-regulated genes involved in gibberellin metabolism between Williams banana and its dwarf mutant","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-identification-expression-profiling-reveal-tissuespecific-expression-differentiallyregula"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":3884381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3763770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269409,"mean":11.39345363909,"rank":133945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":124635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269409,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1095,"mean":3.1669597806216,"rank":448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1095,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":7.6649180327869,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
