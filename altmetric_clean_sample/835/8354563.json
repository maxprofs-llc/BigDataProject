To identify the changes of miRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), we investigated the expression profiles of miRNAs in 40 pairs of OSCC specimens and their matched non-tumour epithelial tissues. Our data revealed higher miR-455-5p expression in the tumour tissues than in the normal tissues; the expression was also higher in oral cancer cell lines than in normal keratinocyte cell lines. MiR-455-5p knockdown reduced both the anchorage-independent growth and proliferative ability of oral cancer cells and these factors increased in miR-455-5p-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, by analysing the array data of patients with cancer and cell lines, we identified ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2B (UBE2B) as a target of miR-455-5p, and further validated this using 3'-untranslated region luciferase reporter assays and western blot analysis. We also demonstrated that UBE2B suppression rescued the impaired growth ability of miR-455-5p-knockdown cells. Furthermore, we observed that miR-455-5p expression was regulated, at least in part, by the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) pathway through the binding of SMAD3 to specific promoter regions. Notably, miR-455-5p expression was associated with the nodal status, stage, and overall survival in our patients, suggesting that miR-455-5p is a potential marker for predicting the prognosis of patients with oral cancer. In conclusion, we reveal that miR-455-5p expression is regulated by the TGF-\u03b2-dependent pathway, which subsequently leads to UBE2B downregulation and contributes to oral cancer tumourigenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc7","authors":["Cheng, Chao-Min","Shiah, Shine-Gwo","Huang, Chien-Chang","Hsiao, Jenn-Ren","Chang, Jang-Yang","Cheng, Chao\u2010Min","Shiah, Shine\u2010Gwo","Huang, Chien\u2010Chang","Hsiao, Jenn\u2010Ren","Chang, Jang\u2010Yang","Chao-Min Cheng","Shine-Gwo Shiah","Chien-Chang Huang","Jenn-Ren Hsiao","Jang-Yang Chang"],"doi":"10.1002\/path.4752","endpage":"49","first_seen_on":"2016-05-29T11:28:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1096-9896","00223417"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Journal of Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1494070027,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27235675?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/path.4752&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27235675?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4752\/pdf","pmid":"27235675","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"38","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Upregulation of miR-455-5p by the TGF-\u03b2-SMAD signalling axis promotes the proliferation of oral squamous cancer cells by targeting UBE2B","type":"article","volume":"240","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/upregulation-mir4555p-tgf%CE%B2smad-signalling-axis-promotes-proliferation-oral-squamous-cancer-cells-tar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":4091727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3866915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272016,"mean":11.531715677444,"rank":134532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":126530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272016,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1186,"mean":3.5064506329114,"rank":723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1186,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.3618918918919,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
