Recent research has shown the impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) in different types of cancer, including testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT). MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs which affect the development and progression of cancer cells by binding to mRNAs and regulating their expressions. The identification of functional miRNA-mRNA interactions in cancers, i.e. those that alter the expression of genes in cancer cells, can help delineate post-regulatory mechanisms and may lead to new treatments to control the progression of cancer. A number of sequence-based methods have been developed to predict miRNA-mRNA interactions based on the complementarity of sequences. While necessary, sequence complementarity is, however, not sufficient for presence of functional interactions. Alternative methods have thus been developed to refine the sequence-based interactions using concurrent expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs. This study aims to find functional cancer-specific miRNA-mRNA interactions in TGCT. To this end, the sequence-based predicted interactions are first refined using an ensemble learning method, based on two well-known methods of learning miRNA-mRNA interactions, namely, TaLasso and GenMiR++. Additional functional analyses were then used to identify a subset of interactions to be most likely functional and specific to TGCT. The final list of 13 miRNA-mRNA interactions can be potential targets for identifying TGCT-specific interactions and future laboratory experiments to develop new therapies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f77","authors":["Sedaghat, Nafiseh","Fathy, Mahmood","Modarressi, Mohmmad-H","Shojaie, Ali"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jtbi.2016.05.026","first_seen_on":"2016-05-29T10:52:40+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi","nigms"],"issns":["1095-8541","00225193"],"journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1464526810,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27235586?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27235586","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Identifying Functional cancer-specific miRNA-mRNA interactions in testicular germ cell tumor","type":"article","volume":"404","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identifying-functional-cancerspecific-mirnamrna-interactions-testicular-germ-cell-tumor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7826281,"mean":6.6353071855279,"rank":5935927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1047477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7826281,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269257,"mean":11.388884652524,"rank":188029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269257,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2012,"mean":3.6346623570363,"rank":1493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2012,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":1.95,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/736860932312170496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8353665],"posted_on":"2016-05-29T10:05:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"736860932312170496"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/736904968901255168","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8353665],"posted_on":"2016-05-29T13:00:10+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
