At 25 days of life, after anesthesia, perfusion and decapitation, the mandibles were removed. Radiographic, histologic, histometric and polarizing microscopy analyses were performed. Statistical analysis was used considering a level of 5% significance.\nThe FL group compared with its control (CL) was shown to differ statistically from the other groups as regards histometry and radiopacity, revealing a reduction in the inferior cortical thickness, reduction in number of osteocytes, with consequent reduction in radiographic bone density. There was also reduction in the number of osteoblasts in FG.\nThe long-term use of fluoxetine via oral route by pregnant and lactating rats modifies the mandibular bone mass.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002150","authors":["Correia-Leite de Marcelos, Priscylla Gon\u00e7alves","Regueira, Luciana Silva","Santiago-Jaegger, Isabela Maria","Cruz Perez, Danyel Elias","de Moraes Ramos-Perez, Flavia Maria","Ev\u00eancio Neto, Joaquim","Baratella-Ev\u00eancio, Liriane"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.acthis.2015.05.005","endpage":"589","first_seen_on":"2016-05-29T22:03:52+00:00","issns":["1618-0372","00651281"],"issue":"6","journal":"Acta Histochemica","last_mentioned_on":1464559413,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26071855?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews"],"pmid":"26071855","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"582","subjects":["histocytochemistry"],"title":"Effects of treatment with fluoxetine on mandibular development: A morphological study in rats","type":"article","volume":"117","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-treatment-fluoxetine-mandibular-development-morphological-study-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7826281,"mean":6.6353071855279,"rank":6778839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7826281,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269258,"mean":11.388763991279,"rank":224231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269258,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226,"mean":2.1883644444444,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.17,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
