This contribution therefore seeks to clarify the principles of stakeholder analysis in an eHealth context. We describe this with reference to a mixed methods national evaluation of ePrescribing systems in English hospitals. We use this evaluation to exemplify the engagement and analytical tools required to ensure a detailed understanding of the issues, challenges and lessons learnt across stakeholder groups. We conclude that this type of approach may support the robustness of evaluations of health IT as well as their longer term impact on innovation in the field.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67f3cf058f6100098a4","authors":["Lee, Lisa","Sheikh, Aziz"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-29T21:30:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0926-9630"],"journal":"Studies in Health Technology & Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1464681127,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27198092"],"pmid":"27198092","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Understanding Stakeholder Interests and Perspectives in Evaluations of Health IT.","type":"article","volume":"222"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":1636513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6193042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269354,"mean":11.391002468879,"rank":74032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":194933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269354,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1099,"mean":1.6962313296903,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1099,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.0969484536082,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":3,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrAzizSheikh\/statuses\/737033229979537408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8359317],"posted_on":"2016-05-29T21:29:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Aziz Sheikh","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Aziz_Sheikh","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000812208298\/cc6e853ff04df76345bd0bd14dede46e_normal.jpeg","description":"Professor @EdinburghUni | Director @EdinUniUsher @AUKCAR & @ARRG_EdUni | Editor @Nature_NPJ PCRM | Co-Director, SQIL @Harvard","id_on_source":"DrAzizSheikh","tweeter_id":"710334528","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":951},"tweet_id":"737033229979537408"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FarrScotland\/statuses\/737190737754914816","license":"gnip","rt":["DrAzizSheikh"],"citation_ids":[8359317],"posted_on":"2016-05-30T07:55:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Farr Institute Scot.","url":"http:\/\/www.farrinstitute.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877481775769014272\/B3dwVXN__normal.jpg","description":"The aim is to both improve the health of the Scottish population & place Scotland as a global leader in health informatics research. #datasaveslives","id_on_source":"FarrScotland","tweeter_id":"2876437118","geo":{"lt":56,"ln":-4,"country":"GB"},"followers":1532},"tweet_id":"737190737754914816"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JaneAnkori\/statuses\/737191844065488896","license":"gnip","rt":["DrAzizSheikh"],"citation_ids":[8359317],"posted_on":"2016-05-30T08:00:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Jane Ankori","url":"http:\/\/janeankoriblog.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/749969776110366721\/iSNXkpmF_normal.jpg","description":"Health & social care.
