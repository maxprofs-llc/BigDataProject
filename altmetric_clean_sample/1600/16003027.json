Previous studies demonstrated that the expression of TNFAIP8 in GC is correlated with tumour occurrence, development, invasion, metastasis and prognosis. However, till now, the relationship between MicroRNA-9 and TNFAIP8 in GC has not been reported.\nLevels of miR-9 and TNFAIP8 expression in GC tissues and in human GC cell lines were studied using qualitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Cell viability was detected using the CCK-8 and clone formation assays. A dual-luciferase reporter system was used to confirm the target gene of miR-9.\nWe found that the expression level of MicroRNA-9 in GC tissues and cell lines was significantly lower than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues and human immortalized gastric epithelial cell (GES) line, respectively. In addition, overexpression of MicroRNA-9 markedly inhibited GC cell proliferation in vitro and tumour growth in vivo. Further experiments revealed that TNFAIP8 was a direct and functional target of MicroRNA-9 in GC and overexpression of MicroRNA-9 obviously down-regulated the expression of TNFAIP8, which was involved in the gastric carcinogenesis and cancer progression.\nOur results suggested that MicroRNA-9-TNFAIP8 might represent a promising diagnostic biomarker for GC patients and could be a potential therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of GC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c5","authors":["Gao, Hong\u2010Yu","Huo, Fu\u2010Chun","Wang, Hai\u2010Yan","Pei, Dong\u2010Sheng"],"doi":"10.1111\/cpr.12331","first_seen_on":"2017-01-31T21:22:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09607722","1365-2184"],"journal":"Cell Proliferation","last_mentioned_on":1485897712,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cpr.12331\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cpr.12331\/pdf","pmid":"28127811","pubdate":"2017-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"MicroRNA-9 inhibits the gastric cancer cell proliferation by targeting TNFAIP8","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/cpr.12331","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna9-inhibits-gastric-cancer-cell-proliferation-targeting-tnfaip8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":7063224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262600,"mean":12.836875197544,"rank":217506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262600,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240,"mean":3.1553807531381,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.66666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HendryVictoria\/statuses\/826541031449624576","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16003027],"posted_on":"2017-01-31T21:21:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Victoria Hendry","url":"https:\/\/uk.linkedin.com\/in\/victoria-hendry-30194bba","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/622833679736434689\/fuSBp3bK_normal.jpg","description":"MLA Heartlands Hospital\n\nLJMU graduate biomedical science looking for research or lab opportunities","id_on_source":"HendryVictoria","tweeter_id":"458383418","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":308},"tweet_id":"826541031449624576"}]}}
