Countries may differ substantially in the approval and coverage decisions for anticancer drugs.\nTo compare the approval and coverage decisions for new anticancer drugs between the United States and 4 other countries: the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and Canada.\nWe identified all new anticancer drug indications approved by the FDA between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013. For each country, we reviewed the organizations, processes, criteria, and special considerations used to make approval and coverage decisions for the drug indications approved. We further quantified and compared the variations across the 5 countries in the approval and coverage decisions as of June 30, 2014, for new anticancer drug indications.\nOf 45 anticancer drug indications approved in the United States between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013, 64% (29) were approved by the European Medicines Agency; 76% (34) were approved in Canada; and 71% (32) were approved in Australia between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2014. The U.S. Medicare program covered all 45 drug indications; the United Kingdom covered 72% (21) of those approved in Europe- only 47% (21) of the drug indications covered by Medicare. Canada and France covered 33% (15) and 42% (19) of the drug indications covered by Medicare, respectively, and Australia was the most restrictive country, covering only 31% (14).\nApproval and reimbursement decisions vary substantially by country. The United States had the fewest access restrictions, and Australia was the most restrictive of the 5 countries that were examined.\nNo outside funding supported this study, and the authors report no conflicts of interest. Study concept and design were contributed primarily by Zhang, along with Hernandez and Hueser. All authors participated in data collection, and data interpretation was performed by Zhang and Hernandez, along with Hueser. The manuscript was written and revised by Zhang and Hernandez, along with Hueser.","authors":["Yuting Zhang","Hana Chantel Hueser","Inmaculada Hernandez"],"doi":"10.18553\/jmcp.2017.23.2.247","first_seen_on":"2017-02-15T03:50:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2376-0540","2376-1032"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy","last_mentioned_on":1495620877,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.18553\/jmcp.2017.23.2.247","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28125371?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28125371","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Comparing the Approval and Coverage Decisions of New Oncology Drugs in the United States and Other Selected Countries","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.jmcp.org\/doi\/10.18553\/jmcp.2017.23.2.247","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparing-approval-coverage-decisions-new-oncology-drugs-united-states-other-selected-countries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":9.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
