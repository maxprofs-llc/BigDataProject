Patients were categorized in the screening group if hepatocellular carcinoma was detected by imaging performed for screening purposes. Generalized linear models and multivariate Cox regression with frailty adjustment were used to compare early detection, curative treatment, and survival between screen-detected and non-screen detected patients.\nAmong 374 hepatocellular carcinoma patients, 42% (n=157) were detected by screening. Screen-detected patients had a significantly higher proportion of early tumors (BCLC stage A 63.1% vs. 36.4%, p<0.001) and were more likely to undergo curative treatment (31% vs. 13%, p=0.02). hepatocellular carcinoma screening was significantly associated with improved survival in multivariate analysis (HR 0.41, 95%CI 0.26-0.65) after adjusting for patient demographics, Child Pugh class, and performance status. Median survival of screen-detected patients was 14.6 months, compared to 6.0 months for non-screen detected patients, with the difference remaining significant after adjusting for lead-time bias (HR 0.59, 95%CI 0.37-0.93).\nHepatocellular carcinoma screening is associated with increased early tumor detection and improved survival; however, a minority of hepatocellular carcinoma patients are detected by screening. Interventions to increase screening use in patients with cirrhosis may help curb hepatocellular carcinoma mortality rates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002203","authors":["Amit G.
