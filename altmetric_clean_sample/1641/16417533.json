Complement with","Compulsive behaviour emerges with ablation of striatal cholinergic interneurons in mice #SCIN #OCD #Tourette"],"citation":{"abstract":"The mechanisms underlying social dysfunction in neuropsychiatric conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) remain uncertain. Dysfunctions in basal ganglia, including reduced number of striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCIN), have been involved in their pathophysiology. To explore the role of SCIN in relation to perseverative behaviors we characterized a new transgenic mouse model in which inducible ablation of SCIN is achieved with high efficiency in a cell-type and region specific manner. Mice were subjected to an extensive behavioral testing including assessment of social behaviors and corticostriatal functional connectivity was evaluated in vivo. Selective SCIN ablation leads to altered social interactions together with exacerbated spontaneously emitted repetitive behaviors. Lesioned mice showed normal motor coordination, balance, and general locomotion. Interestingly, only environmentally-driven, but not self-directed, repetitive behaviors are exacerbated in lesioned mice. Remarkably, in mice with SCIN ablation the normal pattern of social exploration is continuously replayed. The emerging pattern of social interactions is highly predictable and invariant across time. In vivo electrophysiological recordings indicate that SCIN ablation results in an increase of the functional connectivity between different cortical areas and the motor, but not associative, region of the striatum. Our results identify a role of SCIN in suppressing perseverative behaviors including social related ones. In sum, SCIN ablation in mice leads to exacerbated ritualistic-like behaviors that impact on social performance providing a link between SCIN dysfunction and social impairments present in psychiatric disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe sought to uncover the impact of striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCIN) degeneration on perseverative behaviors related to Tourette syndrome (TS) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We found that extensive SCIN ablation results in exacerbated social interactions, where normal social contacts were continuously replayed in a highly stereotyped ritualistic pattern. SCIN ablation also leads to an increase in other spontaneously emitted repetitive behaviors without alteration of motor coordination, balance, or locomotion. Moreover, we identify an increase of functional connectivity between frontal cortical areas and the motor region of the striatum as a putative substrate for the observed behavioral alterations. Thus, perseveration induced by SCIN ablation extends to social performance as it happens in neuropsychiatric conditions like OCD and TS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Yanina V.
