For many, he is considered \"the Father of Modern Surgery\".\nIn our search we went through the literature in Pubmed and Google Scholar as well as the works of Hippocrates and Galen and several other ancient and medieval authors.\nHis work on shoulder injuries and dislocations is outstanding. In this work, he uses the classifications of Hippocrates (460-377\u00a0BC) and Galen (130-201\u00a0BC). He also uses the reduction techniques, ointments, bandages, cooling creams and treatment options described by the ancient medical authors.\nPar\u00e9 is heavily based on the work of previous authors on shoulder dislocations. He uses the work of Hippocrates and Galen as well as the additions made in the Cannon of Medicne of Avicenna.\nAmbroise Par\u00e9 in his excellent work on shoulder dislocations uses the classifications of Hippocrates and Galen and the reduction techniques, cooling ointments, bandages and post-reduction management options as previously described by Hippocrates himself.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002bc7","authors":["Konstantinos Markatos","Marianna Karamanou","Gerasimos Tsourouflis","Georgios Androutsos","Andreas F.
