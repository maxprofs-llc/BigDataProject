At baseline and each follow-up visit, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging was performed, including manual measurements of the height and diameter size of subretinal fluid. The primary outcome measure was the reduction in subretinal fluid following initiation of therapy.\nA total of 17 eyes of 13 patients treated with 25 and 50 mg of oral eplerenone per day were identified. Subretinal fluid (SRF) decreased over time following eplerenone therapy (P= 0.007 and P = 0.002, diameter and height respectively). Maximum SRF height decreased from a mean of 131.5 \u00b5m at baseline to 15.3 \u00b5m at day 181+. SRF diameter decreased from an average of 2174.4 \u00b5m at baseline to 46.9 \u00b5m at day 181+. LogMAR visual acuity improved from 0.42 (Snellen equivalent: 20\/53) at baseline to 0.29 (Snellen equivalent: 20\/39) at day 181+ (P = 0.024). Central subfield thickness (CST) decreased from 339.5 \u00b5m at baseline to 270.3 \u00b5m at day 181+ (P = 0.029).\nEplerenone therapy resulted in significant anatomic and visual improvements in eyes with chronic CSCR.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef752a83ee09648b51cd","authors":["Singh, Rishi P","Sears, Jonathan E","Bedi, Rumneek","Schachat, Andrew P","Ehlers, Justis P","Kaiser, Peter K","Rishi P Singh","Jonathan E Sears","Rumneek Bedi","Andrew P Schachat","Justis P Ehlers","Peter K Kaiser"],"doi":"10.3980\/j.issn.2222-3959.2015.02.17","first_seen_on":"2017-08-30T07:42:51+00:00","issns":["2222-3959"],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1504078966,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3980\/j.issn.2222-3959.2015.02.17","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4413566"],"pmid":"25938046","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Press of International Journal of Ophthalmology","startpage":"310","title":"Oral eplerenone for the management of chronic central serous chorioretinopathy.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oral-eplerenone-management-chronic-central-serous-chorioretinopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":2174032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5125559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173983,"mean":12.525730144498,"rank":55273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":117576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173983,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198,"mean":1.5428934010152,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.5388888888889,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
