Although the exact mechanisms responsible for sepsis-induced mitochondrial damage are unknown, the nuclear transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor-1\u00a0(IRF-1) has been reported to cause mitochondrial damage in several diseases. Previously, we reported that in addition to promoting systemic inflammation, IRF-1 promoted the apoptosis of and inhibited autophagy in macrophages. In the present study, we hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide\u00a0(LPS)-induced IRF-1 activation in macrophages may promote mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress. In\u00a0vitro, LPS was found to promote IRF-1 activation, reactive oxygen species\u00a0(ROS) production, adenosine triphosphate\u00a0(ATP) depletion, superoxide dismutase\u00a0(SOD) consumption, malondialdehyde\u00a0(MDA) accumulation and mitochondrial depolarization in macrophages in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These effects were abrogated in cells in which IRF-1 was knocked down. Furthermore, IRF-1 overexpression increased LPS-induced oxidative stress responses and mitochondrial damage. In\u00a0vivo, peritoneal macrophages obtained from IRF-1\u00a0knockout\u00a0(KO) mice produced less ROS and had less mitochondrial depolarization and damage following the administration of LPS, when compared to their wild-type\u00a0(WT) counterparts. In addition, IRF-1\u00a0KO mice exhibited a decreased release of mitochondrial DNA\u00a0(mtDNA) following the administration of LPS. Thus, IRF-1 may be a critical factor in augmenting LPS-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in macrophages.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f61000795e","authors":["Song-Yun Deng","Le-Meng Zhang","Yu-Hang Ai","Pin-Hua Pan","Shuang-Ping Zhao","Xiao-Li Su","Dong-Dong Wu","Hong-Yi Tan","Li-Na Zhang","Allan Tsung"],"doi":"10.3892\/ijmm.2017.3110","first_seen_on":"2017-08-30T10:21:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1107-3756","1791-244X"],"journal":"International Journal of Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1504088443,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28849179?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28849179","pubdate":"2017-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Role of interferon regulatory factor-1 in lipopolysaccharide-induced mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress responses in macrophages","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-interferon-regulatory-factor1-lipopolysaccharideinduced-mitochondrial-damage-oxidative-stress-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":7302275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173983,"mean":12.525858180731,"rank":142229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173983,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1009,"mean":1.7047162698413,"rank":697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1009,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.99444444444444,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mitopapers\/statuses\/902838485769371648","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24518315],"posted_on":"2017-08-30T10:20:43+00:00","author":{"name":"IamMitochondria","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/720525920327573504\/12ixravl_normal.jpg","description":"I came into eukaryotes few million years ago and now I am making them realise that I am a thing!!
