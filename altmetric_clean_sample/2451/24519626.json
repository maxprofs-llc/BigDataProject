Additionally, activated HSCs may participate in the formation of the tumor microenvironment. Polaprezinc, a protector of the gastric mucosa, has been recently demonstrated to be an inhibitor of liver fibrosis in a mouse model. Proliferation and colony formation assays were performed to determine the inhibitory effects of polaprezinc on the growth of LX\u20112 and hepG2 cells. A migration assay was used to evaluate the change in mobility of LX\u20112 cells and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the expression levels of key markers of fibrosis. Finally, a gene chip assay for polaprezinc\u2011treated hepG2 cells was performed to evaluate the effect of polaprezinc on the hepG2 gene expression profile. The proliferation assay indicated that polaprezinc may inhibit the LX\u20112 cell proliferation and the migration assays confirmed the inhibition of mobility. The expression levels of fibrotic markers such as collagen I, fibronectin and \u03b1\u2011smooth muscle actin were downregulated following polaprezinc treatment. The proliferation activity of polaprezinc\u2011treated hepG2 cells was reduced and the gene chip assay indicated that series of gene expression changes associated with cancer migration, cell skeletal organization and proliferation had occurred. In conclusion, polaprezinc treatment mayinhibit the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and reverse liver fibrosis by deactivating HSCs. The present findings suggest that polaprezinc provides a novel treatment for patients with gastritis complicated with cirrhosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Jun Ye","Zhengsen Zhang","Liang Zhu","Minfang Lu","Yan Li","Jingjing Zhou","Xinliang Lu","Qin Du"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2017.7262","first_seen_on":"2017-08-30T10:51:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1791-2997","1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1504090299,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28849143?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28849143","pubdate":"2017-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Polaprezinc inhibits liver fibrosis and proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":7302270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173983,"mean":12.525843236657,"rank":142226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173983,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2230,"mean":1.721203230148,"rank":1086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2230,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":3.0518633540373,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HCCgenomics\/statuses\/902846269349027845","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24519626],"posted_on":"2017-08-30T10:51:39+00:00","author":{"name":"HCC Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/902471485347971072\/X2TP5zcR_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"HCCgenomics","tweeter_id":"902373584944762881","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6},"tweet_id":"902846269349027845"}]}}
