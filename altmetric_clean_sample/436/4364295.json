The purpose of this study was to examine associations between neighbourhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage, individual-level socioeconomic position (SEP), and usual transport mode.\nThis investigation included 11\u2005036 residents from 200 neighbourhoods in Brisbane, Australia. Respondents self-reported their usual transport mode (car or motorbike, public transport, walking or cycling). Indicators for individual-level SEP were education, occupation and household income; and neighbourhood disadvantage was measured using a census-derived index. Data were analysed using multilevel multinomial logistic regression. High SEP respondents and residents of the most advantaged neighbourhoods who used a private motor vehicle as their usual form of transport was the reference category.\nCompared with driving a motor vehicle, the odds of using public transport were higher for white collar employees (OR 1.68, 95% CrI 1.41-2.01), members of lower income households (OR 1.71 95% CrI 1.25-2.30) and residents of more disadvantaged neighbourhoods (OR 1.93, 95% CrI 1.46-2.54); and lower for respondents with a certificate-level education (OR 0.60, 95% CrI 0.49-0.74) and blue collar workers (OR 0.63, 95% CrI 0.50-0.81). The odds of walking for transport were higher for the least educated (OR 1.58, 95% CrI 1.18-2.11), those not in the labour force (OR 1.94, 95% CrI 1.38-2.72), members of lower income households (OR 2.10, 95% CrI 1.23-3.64) and residents of more disadvantaged neighbourhoods (OR 2.73, 95% CrI 1.46-5.24). The odds of cycling were lower among less educated groups (OR 0.31, 95% CrI 0.19-0.48).\nThe relationships between socioeconomic characteristics and transport modes are complex, and provide challenges for those attempting to encourage active forms of transportation. Further work is required exploring the individual-level and neighbourhood-level mechanisms behind choice of transport mode, and what factors might influence individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds to change to more active transport modes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8083cf058f61000ba9f","authors":["Jerome N Rachele","Anne M Kavanagh","Hannah Badland","Billie Giles-Corti","Simon Washington","Gavin Turrell","Rachele, Jerome N","Kavanagh, Anne M","Badland, Hannah","Giles-Corti, Billie","Washington, Simon","Turrell, Gavin"],"doi":"10.1136\/jech-2015-205620","endpage":"1223","first_seen_on":"2015-08-05T11:23:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1470-2738","0143-005X"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (1978)","last_mentioned_on":1447697072,"links":["http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/04\/jech-2015-205620.long","http:\/\/m.jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/04\/jech-2015-205620?papetoc=","http:\/\/eprints.qut.edu.au\/86493\/","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/69\/12\/1217.short?rss=1","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/69\/12\/1217.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/04\/jech-2015-205620.full.pdf","pmid":"26243197","pubdate":"2015-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Geography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"jech-2015-205620","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices","epidemiology"],"title":"Associations between individual socioeconomic position, neighbourhood disadvantage and transport mode: baseline results from the HABITAT multilevel study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/jech-2015-205620","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/associations-between-individual-socioeconomic-position-neighbourhood-disadvantage-transport-mode-bas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7436389,"mean":6.4647032069826,"rank":742136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6689072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7436389,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225782,"mean":8.3489422670642,"rank":31697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":193763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225782,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2333,"mean":14.157976843911,"rank":499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2333,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":26.778197183099,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":8,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
